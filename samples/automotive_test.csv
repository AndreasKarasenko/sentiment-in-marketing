4.0,"Read instructions, let sit for 5 minutes, watched the color change to a reddish hue - clean rims. Works good.",1400630400,2014-05-21
5.0,This not only protects the receiver from dirt and water it also protects the trailer harness from dirt and water.  I'm very satisfied with this product. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting a quality and useful item for their trailer hitch.,1310169600,2011-07-09
5.0,"This is a really nice, heavy duty sewer hose and I love the connectors and how the hose can be shaped and not just a flexible hose  like most trailer come with.  My pop-up trailer's 4 inch bumper has the bed supports riveted to it, so there are four protrusions on the inside of the bumper making this hose not fit.  I could remove the orange connectors to make it fit, but I decided to mount a Rubbermaid 1172 ActionPacker Storage Box, 24 Gallon on top of the bumper with square U-bolts and it works perfectly.  I am also able to store my Camco 43041 15' Sidewinder Plastic Sewer Hose Support and Tri-Lynx 00018 Lynx Stop 'N Chock Interlocking Wheel Chocks in the container!I love that this hose has two end caps to keep the liquids from dripping out, yuck!!!!",1400025600,2014-05-14
5.0,"On a 2014 wrangler it was about a 10-minute install with no drilling or new hardware, only a 10mm wrench.  You don't even notice it once installed as your foot naturally rests on it, it doesn't bend or give way, and when you realize you are using it, you wonder why the factory didn't include it.",1390694400,2014-01-26
2.0,"I bought several LEd lights for my RV to test them out, and this one was way too blue for my taste.  Bright for the lower number of LEDs it has, but the light doesn't match my other bulbs and looks un-natural to me.",1346976000,2012-09-07
5.0,Great product and does the job nicely... Well made and just right for your installations needs. I would recommend for sure...,1353888000,2012-11-26
4.0,"They get the job done, are a lot less harsh than using a flat head screwdriver. No scratches yet. Only thing is that they aren't as stiff as I thought they would be. They have some give but are sturdy enough to get the job done. I do use them to pull off tabs from my honda civic to get under the bumper and wheel wells. You do need to pry the tabs with a screwdriver first once and a while otherwise these work for that too. Make sure you don't use alot of force or have alot of flex in the tool if you are removing those tabs. I had one shot out and catch me in the eye. For that I'm buying the screwdriver style fastener tab remover. But these are a good buy if you are look for something like this.",1360627200,2013-02-12
3.0,"I was expecting something that I could just cut out and adhere to my car. There's too much of a process involved and the mere mention of how it can easily be removed with 3M scratch removal system makes me nervous.If you're into hand-crafted artistic endeavors, you can have a blast copying some complex image onto the surface and tracing it out with some type ofXacto knife set, and then apply it to your car. It could make for a fun project if that's you.This is a product for the brave, faith-filled adventurer, for someone willing to experiment on his or her paint job or for someone who has seen it applied to someone else's car first and is comfortable with the results. I am none of the above when it comes to my car's paint, so my apologies for thinking it sounded like a good idea at the time and then backing out. If I was driving my first used car with its dents and scratches I would have been a more willing participant. The ""okay"" rating will have to reflect the price of the product compared to the price of an equivalent handy craft and the quality of the instructions and materials.",1334534400,2012-04-16
5.0,"I believe the older 2.0L WRX take the Purolator PL14460 filter, but this is the filter for 2.5L WRX and WRX STI.  This is the closest(nearly identical) thing to the OEM Subaru filter.  The textured grip is a nice touch that I have not seen before in a filter.  Good price and easy to buy on Amazon.  I bought four and am happy with my purchase.",1348963200,2012-09-30
2.0,"Knowing that red items might bleed, I decided to put the towels in a sink-full of water to see what happened. Oh, my gosh, these towels faded badly. I left them soak a while, wrung them out, added more hot water & let them soak again...they faded more. I repeated this process one more time, then wrung the towels out & let them dry. I decided to handwash a couple of them, so I soaped them up & ran hot water on them. I couldn't believe that the water was even redder than before. I'm wondering if they'll ever stop fading.The two I handwashed were used for general house cleaning. They did a good job dusting, absorbing water & keeping surfaces lint free. I will dedicate some for glassware use but might bleach them to hopefully stop the color bleed.Because of their waffle weave texture, the towels measure about 1/2"" shorter all the way around than advertised.  They can be stretched to the advertised size.Zwipes Waffle Weave towels perform like microfiber should, but I cannot recommend the burgundy color.",1394496000,2014-03-11
4.0,"I bought these brake rotors for my dads 2003 Toyo Corolla and he tried to install them himself but he had trouble.  He took them to a local tire shop and they installed them for him and they were great.  No screeching noise from the brakes, great stopping power and smooth tire turning. Great purchase for my dad.",1392681600,2014-02-18
4.0,"These wipers come with four different types of adapters which should make them compatible with most car makes.My car uses the most common type of adapter, the J-hook.  I have always gotten blades that have an obvious hook on them and have snapped them on without even having to think about it.These required several minutes of me having to think about which adapter to use, although the pictures showing each type of adapter on the inside of the cover was pretty straightforward.It took me several minutes of struggle to get the adapter for the hook type mechanism to fit securely onto the blade.  At first I had simply put the adapter into the connecting place on the blade, but it clearly wasn't secured and would simply lift right off.  After a few minutes of puzzling over the installation picture, then trying different things on the adapter, I finally was able to get it to snap securely onto the blade.The adapter seems a bit big and bulky.  It's a minor point but still, it is definitely bigger than other wipers have.Right after I installed these on my car we had a nice downpour here, our first in many months.  These performed flawlessly.I did not remove the little sticker that covers up the yellow wear indicator.I can tell when a wiper blade needs replacing easily enough and don't want a yellow reminder to look at.  Here we get so much sun glare year round that I replace wiper blades about once a year, and tires every two or three years, even though they still have plenty of tread, due to rubber rot.These seem about as good as the Bosch wiper blades they replaced, although not quite as simple to install due to having to attach an extra piece.",1357430400,2013-01-06
5.0,"I really like this stuff, It makes your tires shine. One can for me does not last really long, but I think it tops off your car after each wash.",1380672000,2013-10-02
5.0,Bought this to use with the torque app on my android device. It works great.  This is a lot more convenient to use than a standard scanner and can provide a lot more info when paired with an application like Torque.,1392854400,2014-02-20
4.0,This item works excellent.  The pull tab for the battery broke when pulled leaving the insulator on the battery.  Had to open to remove it.  Other than that the item preforms great!,1374537600,2013-07-23
5.0,"I bought a cheaper charger first but they changed product design by eliminated the essential second LED indicator.  When I plug it in to my car, I have no idea is the charger is working or it just indicate the battery is connected, very dumb.  The Batter Tender Junior has 4 modes indication, very useful when connection wire having problem or the charger is not working probably.",1383091200,2013-10-30
4.0,"Very soft, works good for detailing and window cleaning.  It's not 100% lint free but it's pretty close.  I keep one in the bathroom to dry my hands on before I put my contacts in, it keeps them clean and avoids any pain from lint getting on the contact.",1373500800,2013-07-11
5.0,"Very well made and is actually REAL leather , not some synthetic or bonded leather!  Works great and is very easy to put on , keeps you warm on those cold days and nights!  I'm 5'6&#34; , 160 lbs and ordered the Medium size , works perfect over my jeans.",1384214400,2013-11-12
5.0,"I had an older version of this with a rough surface that trapped dirt constantly.  Impossible to clean.  But this one is shiny black powder-coated metal, and its way better.  Fit the oven in my Ragen 2003 27T Toyhauler perfectly.",1376006400,2013-08-09
5.0,"I received one 22""ACDelco 22ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blade with Wear Indicator - 22"" (Pack of 1)and installed this on the driver-side of the windshield of my 1998 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer SUV.  This was one of my very first attempts to install a replacement blade and I found it rather easy to do.One of the challenges living near the ocean is dirt and grime from salt and sand. The wiper has done a great job so far in cleaning the mess without leaving streaks.We've had quite a bit of nasty weather this month and the wiper covers the entire area without any skips, streaks or squeaking.I will order another for the passenger side as well.  I also appreciate the wear indicator as a gentle reminder to replace these, occasionally.",1358208000,2013-01-15
4.0,Good windshield wiper for the price. Not the bottom of the barrel. Have lasted 6 months now with no problems. Good price as well.,1369958400,2013-05-31
4.0,"This is a nice looking wiper blade, if you are the kind of person who notices things like that. It is all a matte black, one piece unit, without the 'traditional' metal looking flanges. It has a 'performance' look to it.I like that the blade comes with three different attachment clips, so you can pick and chose the right one for your car. That is a thoughtful touch - normally I have to futz too much with getting a wiper to fit, clipping things to 'make' them fit.They work well in the rain, clearing off a nice section to see out of, as all wipers do when they are new. They work smoothly and evenly over the glass.They don't work as well for dust, but that's really not what these are made for.Although these are touted as being superior for cold weather, the real test for me will be this summer, in the Arizona desert temperatures. Usually any wipers I install around spring end up warped by the heat a few months later. And the dust doesn't help, either. :)Recommended for wet rainy days, for ease of attachment, and for a stylish look.",1367712000,2013-05-05
5.0,"This is a must have product to have in your vehicle at all times. I have not tested the device and hope that I don't ever have to but it is recommended to have in your car, truck, SUV at all times. I would recommend this product to others for sure.",1392940800,2014-02-21

5.0,"Used this to replace the stock intake tube on a 2004 Tahoe 5.3L V8. In conjunction with a K&N panel filter it has added a nice distant intake rumble at higher RPMs without being noticeable while cruising along. There was a small power gain which I noticed at lower RPMs where the transmission would normally downshift it can now pull a little harder from higher gears (overdrive, etc). It also freed up room under the hood which makes accessing the accessory belts easier.",1404950400,2014-07-10
5.0,A little pricey... but just cool as crap!  Very simple idea... why didn't I think of that kind of thing.  No one gets my tailgate without a torch!,1404604800,2014-07-06
3.0,"I think that for a sound deadening material like this to work, you would need to install a lot of it if the goal is to make a noticeable difference in noise levels inside a car. Just adding it to exposed trunk panels which I thought might be the source of excessive road noise didn't seem to make any difference at all. Perhaps the real point is that reducing annoying sound levels requires expertise far beyond mine. I suppose that isn't the fault of the product, but it is a matter of expectations not being met. A professional who knows what they are doing would probably need a whole lot of this material installed in the right places to make a difference.",1371945600,2013-06-23
2.0,"These wipers were installed on my Prius. I've had it for several years and the original wipers were just not cleaning as they used to.  I was surprised that this small car needed a wiper that was longer than the ones my 4 Runner uses.I'm not sure why, but the larger blade started to leave about 2 to 3 inches smeared in the middle of the blade. I have reinstalled it, used my old trick of diluted vinegar to clean the blade and the windscreen and it still does not do an adequate job. The smaller blade is working fine, but this larger one will definitely need to be replaced before the next few days of inclement weather.",1367366400,2013-05-01
5.0,"This is a great product at a great price. I used it to listen to the cam banks on my BMW to isolate which the noise is coming from and what the root cause might be. It's the first time I have used a device like this but it's amazing how effective a simple, old school device like this is. Considering how much vehicles cost, mechanics charge per hour, parts cost, etc., this tool is indispensible.",1321747200,2011-11-20
5.0,A great low priced way to protect the rims on my Trail 90.  They also make changing the tire easier.,1394496000,2014-03-11
5.0,Who would have ever thought to make a clip and trim panel remover like this? There isn't a panel in my car I've failed to remove with this set on my side. I'm afraid that the plastic trim panels in my car would break due to it being a 14 year old car. These are very sturdy and the leverage on this is perfect. It basically fits anywhere.,1354665600,2012-12-05
5.0,"I got these for my drive lights I mounted on my grille guard. They work great and are very well built and look sharp as well so I gave them 5 stars.However, for the Ridgeline they do not fit very well in the utility spots underneath the A/C controls as that they are not wide enough to fill in the extremely wide gap Honda has. Eventually I will possibly try to get OEM switches to replace these so I have a more finished look.",1334707200,2012-04-18

5.0,I used this kit to do the badly damaged lenses on a motorhome. There is enough for probably 2 more sets. It took about an hour. This is a nicely made kit of everything you need to make the worst lenses look great. You will need a drill.The things that you must remember.The drill needs to be around 1600 rpm. Less and it may take a long time. A corded one may be the best.This is not for the merely discolored but not scratched. For those an oxidation remover is better. This is for the ones where the hard coating is damaged and scratched.This will remove any UV barrier left and you can expect UV discoloration and scratching to begin showing up again in 3 months with all of these kits. The included UV protection won't do much to stop it. I suggest getting either a spray on UV cured hard coating or a aftermarket protection sheet coating to protect them. (Amazon sells them). In my case that added $40 to the cost of the job but replacement lights would be $500 for the pair!. I expect this to last for 1-3 years before needing the scratch covering replaced.,1342656000,2012-07-19
4.0,This is a good fit for my motorcycle (PC800). The stitching seems to be coming loose but there are some decent winds out here so I am taking it with a grain of salt. Time will tell how long it lasts and if it doesn't hold up I will update this.,1373068800,2013-07-06
3.0,"I was hoping that the outside of this bag would have been of a smoother plastic/pvc like material that would allow for wiping of bugs off at least the front of the bag after a long trip. That is not the case at all with this bag. Instead you have to get out a soft brush and sit there and work with some cleaners and rinse it gently to make sure the water proofing is maintained.Overall it's a nice roof top cargo bag but the lack of ability to easily clean off bugs is rather annoying and disgusting at the same time. I live in a state that has a high insect population during the summer and if you mess up and drive at dawn or dusk with this on top of the car or van you end up with a massive amount of bugs coating it. I was able to use a friends luggage wind deflector to reduce the amount of bugs on the bag but better construction of the bag would have not needed this.Also the underside of the bag is like the rest of the bag, rough fabric that I didn't want laying against the paint on the roof of my car. I had a sheet of tacky rubber that I put against the top of the car that I just peeled off after my weekend trip with everyone, that worked great to protect my paint.Overall, I'm disappointed in some of the aspects of this product but I do realize that most people aren't as particular about certain things like I am so I adjusted my review score accordingly.",1350864000,2012-10-22
5.0,"All RV'ers should have one. I bought this before right after I bought my TT, and used it right away. It's particularly useful when you have a long run to the sewer drain. Much better and easier to use than a couple rocks or pieces of wood.",1385769600,2013-11-30

4.0,"I own my own detailing business and use this product exclusively for three purposes.  1. As a clay lubricant for paint contamination removal and 2. Putting the finishing touch on vehicles that are freshly painted and/or have had recent body work.  I love the fact that it's body shop safe, and 3. Prepping my polishing pads.  Otherwise, for anything else I use Meguiars synthetic spray detailer that wipes off even easier and has the added benefit of putting a protective ""film"" over the vehicle.  Another great product by Meguiars.",1337644800,2012-05-22

4.0,"i thought it was a little high on the price until i used it. I also bought a cheaper wash mitt and realized that this mitt has an inner liner that helps keep your hands dry, as long as you don't dump your hole hand in the wash bucket. A big factor if you are washing out in the cold.good wash mitt, will buy another.",1362873600,2013-03-10

4.0,"It's not perfect, but smells awesome! If you have any other colored car than black, then this would work just fine. It's very good with detailing clay and good to use after washing. It will definitely keep you from scratching your paint when drying or removing a very fine layer of dust. Only problem is on dark or black cars, it may streak. There may be better and less-expensive options in that case.",1374969600,2013-07-28
5.0,"For some reason all of the bulbs in my VW Golf, not just the headlights, seem to burn out frequently. I've gone through about 7 pair of headlight bulbs in 10 years. I've tried expensive ones, long life ones, and many others. None seemed to last any longer than the others and even light output seemed to be the same. The last set I bought were these and so far they seem to have lasted longer than the rest, including the OEM bulbs. I bought this set to keep in the car for when the other do go out, which I'm sure they will. These are not supper premium, high output, magic bulbs, and therefore are reasonably priced. Even though they are not the newest wiz bang bulbs they seem to me to put out the same light as any other bulb yet also seem to hold up better.",1386288000,2013-12-06

Purchased them at Amazon...48 Zwipes for under $23!Price and color wise this is the way to go.These burgundy waffle weave Zwipes are targeted for stemware.  They did a fine job on glassware, mirrors and computer screens in our home.I also find the regular Zwipe to be just as effective, especially when new.When I purchase any Zwipes, I designate half the colors for water and windex cleaning, and the other half for polishing with waxes etc.Machine wash with no fabric softener and you are cleaning well and saving the environment.",1393200000,2014-02-24

5.0,My husband installed these on his 97 Cherokee in just 10 minutes.  Remove 2 bolts on top of each lift support and place a screwdriver under the spring clip on bottom and the ball joint connection on the lower end slips right on.Trunk now stays up and doesn't hit him in his head! Worth the time and money for sure.Be sure to support the trunk with a 2x4 or long broom handle before removing old lifts. Save the bolts because there are no bolts provided with the new lifts.,1354579200,2012-12-04

5.0,"This is definitely on the cutting edge (sorry for the pun) of technology.  Instead of using three different cutting compounds in bringing out the paint, this stuff starts out a little more abrasive and breaks down to a finer compound as you keep buffing.  I don't have any idea how they figured that out, or how it accomplishes the process, but it does work just like Meguiar's says it does.  Very easy product to use with my Porter Cable buffer.",1362700800,2013-03-08

5.0,"If your headlights are yellowed, fogged, or opaque from sun damage, you're not seeing as well at night as you could be. There's a ton of kits out there to refinish headlights, and they all work the same way, by sanding off the damaged layer, and polishing the plastic underneath to a smooth surface.The bonus here is the protectant, which helps prevent the yellowing and oxidation from coming back. You do need to apply it often, once a month or so, to keep protection in place, but a good car wax will work once you run out of the packet.3M has frequent rebates on these products, so keep an eye out and give one a try. It's a small price to pay for safety on the road.",1401235200,2014-05-28
5.0,"I am impressed by the build quality of this simple volt meter.  There is a fuse built in and the plastic is very solid.  The side spring connectors have good tension to keep this plugged in tight.  Despite the blue tint to the lens, the LEDs are RED colored.  You get readings with .1 decimal increments.  The readings in my car update about every second as the alternator voltage varies.  I measured this against a Fluke meter and it tracked almost exactly.

5.0,"Its a bit pricy - twice the cost of a comparable fram or something similar. However on a motorcycle access can be tight at times, and having that 17mm nut welded on the front is worth the difference in cost.

5.0,I bought this mainly for topping off 4 12v scooter batteries before I chain them for a 48v scooter. I also use it to maintain one 12v for an alarm. I had a so-called maintainer that cost as much as this charger but only was .75 amp. It burned up trying to top off some 12v batteries. With this unit you can bring a battery to full charge in about 12 hours.I am very pleased with this charger/maintainer and would recommend it. Schumacher is a very old company.

There are some things this meter can do that I'll never use or understand but for what I do know this will come in very handy and save me a boat-load of money. The sockets in two of my bathrooms were not working and I boiled it down to the breaker box. An electrician wanted a hundred and fifty bucks to change one breaker. For a fraction of the cost this meter helped me find the problem. (Breaker box not labeled properly by builder)I like the large digital numbers and solid construction of the meter. However I do not like the dark green and dark red print on the black face. It's almost impossible to read unless the light is very bright. Who thought dark print on dark was a good idea?

5.0,"The pads are definitely large enough to heat you quickly.  The low setting is very warm, and the high setting is too hot.  They get to max temp about as quickly as factory heated seats.As the product states, it is for professional installation only, but it's really not that difficult.  Do a Google search for the product, and you'll find an installation guide.  The electrical part is the easiest.  They give you a fuse tab, so there's really not much electrical work required.Installation (done on a 2006 Mazda 3):Disconnect the bolts (probably 4) holding the seat to the car.Disconnect the battery ground!!!  Your battery will probably die from being unplugged so long, so be prepared to jump the vehicle.  Don't connect the battery ground until everything (mainly the airbag wires) are reconnected.Unplug any connectors(power seats, airbags...) from the seat.Remove the seat, and take it indoors.Start removing clips/clasps/velcro holding the seat fabric on (this is the most time consuming part).  It's very similar to doing upholstery on a couch.  The seats have metal clips, similar to staples.  This is what the included tool is for.  The tool did break within 10 seconds of me using it, but a normal pair of needle nose pliers works just as well.Only remove the clips that are necessary for placing the pads.  You don't really need to replace them if the fabric holds tightly by itself.Make sure you figure out where you want the pads before you uncover the sticky tape.Place the pads so that the wires are going toward the bottom rear of the seat.  Place sticky side onto the foam.  You may have to rip out a little hole in the foam for heating pad connectors to rest in.  This will prevent lumps in the seat.Ensure that the pad wires are in a good spot and won't get in the way of people sitting behind the seat.  You want them exiting the bottom rear of the seat.  You can always make an extra hole for the wires.Pull tight and make sure it looks and feels good before reattaching the fabric.  You don't want lumps or wrinkles.Re-install the seat.  Make sure wires will fit (along with your button location) to the fuse box.  Plug back in anything that was disconnected from the seats (airbags and other wires).Decide where to put the button.  I chose near my right knee.  This will allow you to drill the hole without removing any dash components.  Pick a location where you can drill without hurting anything, and still be able to run the wires from the hole.Run the wires from the rear of the seat to the foot well.  Depending on the vehicle, this can probably be done by shoving the wires between the carpet and the plastic trim.  I didn't have to remove any trim.Connect all the connectors so your're ready to install the fuse tab.Using your vehicle manual, choose a fuse.  You're car might have a &#34;heated seats&#34; fuse already allocated.  Make sure the fuse will turn off when the engine is off, and has the correct (or greater) amps.  I chose a ground location on one of the bolts in the pedal assembly in the driver's foot well.Your battery is probably dead by this point, so make sure everything is plugged in and in place, and reconnect the battery ground and try to start.  Jump the battery if needed.Make sure the switch works, and turns off when the engine is off.Put everything back together, hide wires with zip ties, and make it look good.",1385510400,2013-11-27
1.0,All of frams oil filters are nothing but cardboard inside. I saw several video's on youtube showing how bad these are so I cut my old one open at 3000 mi. to see if its true. Its TRUE! All cardboard even the end caps. Even the tough guards! All fram filters are like this. Whats worse is the pleats. The cardboard pleats close shut and this makes the oil have to seek another open pleat to enter. Mine had half of its pleats closed. That means only half the oil filter was working.Next is the seem were the pleated rows are connected. It was open half way up the seam because the glue came loose!  That means dirty oil was by passing the filter all together.  These are the worst filters on the market no doubt. Fram just spent so much money blowing smoke up our tails we believe they are good filters....Cut your old fram open and look inside.

4.0,"This is a solid little compressor and is perfect for throwing in your trunk. I bought this after returning a cheap plastic &#34;accu-gauge&#34; compressor that didn't work. I've only used this thing twice so far, but I'm very satisfied with it.The Good:- Solid metal construction. I think it's made of steel, but it's extremely solidly built.- Brass screw-on connector to attach to your valve stem. I really can't believe some people don't like this. Three twists and the brass connector is locked solid onto your valve stem and doesn't come off. Yes, it loses a tiny bit of pressure when you unscrew it, but it's a negligible amount. This connector is so much easier and reliable than the kind where you flip the little handle up.- Relatively quiet for an air compressor. It sounds like a lawnmower in your neighbor's backyard, which is much quieter than most.- It doesn't get too hot. I inflated large SUV tires from 25 to 35 PSI and the heatsink was warm, but not hot.- Comes with a nice little carrying case.The Bad:- The gauge is off by at least 5 PSI. When this pump read 40 PSI, my more accurate digital gauge read 35. This means that you really need a separate pressure gauge to use this thing.- My pump has a warning printed directly on the glass face of the gauge (and it's not removable) stating the margin of error of the gauge. This is a terrible place to put it and makes the gauge difficult to read.- In order to fit the pump into the carrying case, you have to detach the rubber air hose.- The cord is just a little short - an extra foot or two would make a huge difference.",1387324800,2013-12-18

I carry two cans per car because I had a hose assembly break. Or,  keep the nozzle hose assembly off the top of the can for a spare.  This will seal some bead leaks, but not with the wheel mounted on the car.

5.0,"What we have here is an innovative sanding block designed for a narrow range of uses.  If you use a sanding block, this 3M is worth checking out.I've built RC airplanes for 3 decades.  If I'd found this 3M sander on an RC website 30 years ago, I would've bought it.  Balsa creates a ton of dust.  I do most of my building in the winter months which means standing outside in the weather freezing my tail feathers off.  No more.Having only one sanding method for a hobbyist or DIY'er is like a plumber trying to do his job with only one tool: a screwdriver.This 3M sander is not for everyone.  It is specific in purpose as are many tools.  My rating is based on using it for its designed purpose, not sanding down a garage door.The biggest drawback for one who does a good deal of sanding is excessive use of elbow grease.This is a light plastic hand sander that uses sandpaper with holes through which the dust is sucked up by your own vacuum.  And it's designed for mostly flat surfaces and gentle curves like wings and components of balsa airplanes.For someone who does one or two small sanding jobs a year in an enclosed environment, this might be exactly what you need.No one tool is suitable for everybody.Most all of my detailed sanding jobs on tables, bookcases and furniture are done with the B&D; Mouse and rolls of sanding cloth regardless of the size of the project.  However, neither method offers a dust port.So many times in my workshop I find myself having to combine the best features of several tools to best complete a project.I found a good use for the hose on the 3M sander.For years when using the B&D; Mouse, I've held the Mouse in one hand and the hose of a small 6-gallon, 3HP Shop-Vac in the other sucking up the dust as I go.  I've always felt that the hose on the Shop-Vac was too big and rigid to easily follow the movements of the Mouse. It was a bit awkward but highly effective..The convenient size and flexibility of the 3M Clean Sand Kit hose is perfect.  All I did was duct tape the 3M hose to the Shop-Vac hose.If you do a lot of sanding, there's better news.If you have a Bosch Random Orbital Sander, variable speed, 8-hole sander for big jobs, the 3M hose and funnel shaped connector work great.  In fact, most brands of orbital sanders have dust collection ports that can be adapted to work.There are rubber boot adapters on Bosch for the dust ports.  Some are oval on both ends to connect the sander port with an accessory filter.  The one I have is round on one end to fit a Shop-Vac hose.  Whatever model you have, duct tape will made it work.I secured both ends of the 3M hose with duct tape and gave it a whirl.  Granted, it's not 100% effective but close.  When running the sander at slow speeds, my workshop stays dust free.In case you're wondering, a 16-gallon Shop-Vac is entirely too powerful and the hose is too big.  The restricted air flow created by the small 3M hose creates too must stress on the motor and will likely shorten its life.Not many DIY'ers and hobbyists have those expensive dust collection systems like the professionals on TV.  We have to make do as best we can and do what works within our budgets.Whatever you sand, make it as smooth as glass.",1379116800,2013-09-14

5.0,"When I first read about claying your vehicles, several years ago, I was a bit skeptical.  It seems strange and like a lot of work for you car, but both impressions were incorrect.After washing your vehicle with a safe wash, Claying your vehicle is the next step and a vital step.  Claying removes above surface contaminants on your paint's surface: bits of overspray, tar, etc. and lots of other things you can or more likely can't even see.  After washing your car, rub your flat hand across the surface. It won't smooth as glass. Furthermore, listen!  You'll hear your hand going back and forth over the surface as it rubs against the contaminants.  This is a car that needs to be clayed and just about any car if it has never been clayed needs to be clayed.  Even a brand new car on the lot often has contaminants.  Furthermore, once clayed, it's usually recommend to do it again every 3 months to a year, depending on the environment your car is in.  Honestly, claying your vehicle doesn't take a particularly long amount of time.  I'd say it's possible to do it in just under thirty minutes.The Smooth Surface Clay Kit from the wonderful folks at Meguiar's is the perfect kit to clay your vehicle.  Again, after washing your vehicle, spray an area with the Quick Detailer, and then use the clay bar across the surface.  You can search Youtube for Meguiar's Clay kit, to see demonstrations from users, but it isn't hard to do. Do a thorough job on your vehicle, and the way your hand then moves across the surface will impress you.  I'm amazed every time.After claying, you have several options.  The clay kit includes a sample of cleaner wax, and you can certainly use that. It has some mild cleaners and some protection.  However, if you use a cleaner wax, I'd recommend waxing the car more often as it isn't quite as durable as dedicated separate products.  Once a month for example with the cleaner wax, would be good.  Or, you could use the cleaner wax for its mild below surface cleaning properties followed by a more robust wax product such as Meguiar's Gold Class or NXT 2.0, and then you could potentially be set for a few months.If you want to do even more after claying, you can use a paint cleaner from Meguiar's for below surface contaminants right after claying, and then optionally a Pure Polish after that.  You'd top all that off with a wax such as Meguiar's Gold Class, or Meguiar's NXT 2.0.Furthermore, pick up more of the Quick Detailer, and you can use it to remove light dust and contaminants to your paint on a regular basis, and you can actually find you won't have to wash your vehicle as often.Whatever you choose, regular maintenance of your car's finish will keep you smiling for years to come. Meguiar's clay kit is a great way to start because not only does it make your finish smooth as glass, but it allows whatever wax you apply to adhere more evenly and properly to the surface, providing a better shine and longer lasting protection.A great product. Highly recommended.",1221436800,2008-09-15
5.0,I have owned mine for at least 10 years and have used it quite often during that period. For the price it's a great value. The only hit is that you will need a gauge to check how much pressure is in your tire. There is a valve attached that allows you to check pressure without removing the air hose from the tire.Once again mine has workked well for a lot of years and it has taken quite a bit of abuse in that time. If you are looking for an occasional use inexpensivve inflator and do not mind using a gauge to check pressure than this one fits the bill.Update:Had to finally purchase a new one. Even though the product posting states the pressure check valve comes with DO NOT BELIEVE IT. The new ones do NOT have it and that brings my rating down on this. Had I known that I would not have purchased it. Not worth returning because I bundled it with something else and got free shipping which they would now charge me. My first bad purchase on here.

After checking with our local garage, which diagnosed the problem with &#34;something catalytic converter&#34;-related (and hearing the potential repair costs), the mechanic suggested trying this CRC Guaranteed To Pass Emissions Test Formula first.

4.0,"As I said in the title, this works great, but it's a bit bulky.  Since 500 watts is too much power to pull from a cigarette lighter socket, you'll need to either wire it in, or use the supplied clips to attach it to your car battery.  If your power needs are less than 180 watts (or so), you're better off looking at a smaller, lower power unit.  If you need to power more than a couple hundred watts, this will do it...just remember that you'll blow a fuse if you simply plug it into a dash socket.",1377734400,2013-08-29

4.0,"This is very lightweight, the carrying bag is thin but sturdy enough, and it has a pocket inside to keep the directions if you fold them!  I wish the accessories were in a separate container or secured inside.  I put mine into a small zipper bag to keep them together.  When you put the inflator back into the bag it only fits one direction, because of the LED light.I agree that the light could have used a focusing lens but I do like the way it swivels to give you more options on positioning.  The instructions say the gauge is just a guide and not to believe it's the correct pressure.  I found the gauge to be about 4 lbs. lower than actual, so you do need an independent tire gauge to check to see if there was enough pressure.  I do like the way you can set the pressure you desire and it will turn off when it reaches it, a nice safety feature.It was easy to put on, the buttons are self-explanatory.  A good value, I think.",1380067200,2013-09-25

5.0,"I have been using Mother's California Gold Carnauba Wax for over 20 years.  It's easy to apply, and tends to spread out nicely, so when it dries there usually isn't a thick layer with a lot of clumps, that needs to be removed.  Dried wax buildup happens in some areas, but it isn't as big of an issue as with some other brands.A can of wax usually lasts a really long time.  Of course buffing is the part that involves the most work, and while it still takes a little effort, it's not that huge of a chore with this product.  Very little dust is generated, and you get a nice shine that holds up reasonably well even under high UV exposure.Perhaps there is slightly less in the can now, or maybe the formula changed, but a can cost about $10 way back then, and it's still about the same price now.  Although I mostly prefer to use liquid or spray on type wax products, there are still times when I want to use paste wax, and this is the stuff I go with.  It does the job, doesn't require that much muscle, and also has a really nice smell.  Try it, you'll like it.",1347408000,2012-09-12

5.0,"As with all my car parts reviews, I am pleased with the quality and relatively low cost of the Amazon care parts. This tensioner is no exception. A genuine AC Delco part, top quality, installed perfectly, works perfectly, and saved me money over other online discount car parts places, and saved me hundreds over the repair shops. This part is for my Silverado 1500 with 221,000 miles. Engine and trans fine. I've been replacing sensors and some accessory parts as required since about 200,000 miles. Truck looks and runs like new. I have never had a bad or incorrect part from Amazon. I use their &#34;My Garage&#34; feature that remembers my truck, and tells me which parts are for my engine. I like that a lot, as well as the cost savings and delivery. This tensioner part is genuine, works perfectly, and is quiet as new! I recommend it. As an aside, on my Silverado, to access the drive belt and these accessories on the front of the motor, you have to remove the air duct (2 ring clamps), and the upper radiator shroud (6 plastic push-pins, and two small bolts).

I put 2 applications on each tire. I did not notice a impressive result. I let it cure for about a half hour. It looked better. I parked the car in the garage overnight. I was extremely impressed the next day when I checked on the tires appearance.  It was a deep classy look. The car had a different look. The car by the way is a 2012 MAalibu LTZ.

5.0,"I have used numerous different sponges and wash mitts on my cars over the years, with varying results. The microfiber wash mith from Meguiar's ranks up there as the best one I have used. It is safe for the cars finish and it doesn't trap as much dirt on the mitt like other mitts have in the past. In the event that it does, simply running the mitt over a grit guard loosens up anything and you are back to washing in a flash.I have been a fan of Meguiar's products for years, and this particular accessory is no different. It has made washing my vehicle much easier and also more enjoyable.",1376352000,2013-08-13

4.0,I've been using diluted (10 to 1) Simple Green to clean the interior of my cars for many years. It works on nearly any surface except glass.  It's also cheap and smells pleasant (at least to my unrefined sniffer).  I decided to buy this Meguiars interior detailed just to compare it with Simple Green.  I love Meguiars Gold class exterior spray detailed - the stuff is just amazing.  I also use Meguiars cleaner wax on my cars.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product.  It does exactly what it says it should do.  I give it 4 stars for function and quality.  My gripe is that is doesn't really work any better than something 1/5 it's price.  I'll probably stick with Simple Green and skip buying this again.,1397865600,2014-04-19

I used this on a black car and it left no swirls.Always use a quality soap. I use Chemical Guys products exclusively - all of their soaps are wonderful.This is microfiber. So treat it like you would a microfiber towel - always rinse it out, and only use a good dedicated microfiber detergent. Once again, Chemical Guys microfiber detergent comes to mind.

4.0,"I bought this for my dads 2003 Mercury Sable as a 2012 Christmas present.  His vehicle had the original bulbs in them and they were starting to dim and always had that nasty &#34;yellowish&#34; look to them.  Installation on his vehicle was a breeze and I am happy to report that this product was a major upgrade from stock factory headlights.They provide a nice clear beam with a small tint of blue, but not that annoying BAM blue.  Do not expect these to mimic HID headlights or light up the road like a good pair of HID headlights will.  However, if you are looking for a solid set of replacement bulbs from factory these should satisfy you.I own a pair of silverstar headlights on my truck and I would have to say that I do like the silverstars better.  However, it is one thing to take into consideration that I have HEARD that these bulbs last longer and are of course, slightly cheaper up front.Pros:Light up the road considerably better as opposed to stock &#34;yellow&#34; beams.Gives the car a cleaner/fresher/newer look at night from the frontWallet/Purse friendlyCons:  Some may find these to be just a tad bit on the blue side.  If you are looking for something a little more sharp and true to white I highly recommend the silverstars.  Stay away from the ultras though.

4.0,"About a month before buying this Black and Decker unit I bought the Energizer 84020 power station for what I thought was a great Gold Box price. It wasn't. I also discovered that though I like the Energizer's design quite a bit, it's not as robust as I had hoped. And so, greedy for more power I bought the Black and Decker Electromate also.I bought both of these as emergency power sources for the next power outage. We had one this past year that lasted 8 days. No, even two of these dressed up car batteries won't help much for 8 days, but I figured that I can at least bring one to work with me every day for a recharge.I like this Black and Decker unit. It has a nice built in light for emergencies, jump start capablilities, a robust tire inflator, and plug ins for A/C and D/C. The D/C outlet should come in handy should I have to charge our Kindle Fire during an outage.We haven't had an outage yet, so I did a simulated outage to test this power source. It kept a floor lamp burning for about 8 hours, one with a fluorescent bulb but welcome light nonetheless. Before running the light test, I played with the Electromate for about an hour. It wouldn't run my electric stapler/nailer. It did power an electric drill, a television, a DVR player, a radio, and a coffee maker. Not all at the same time, of course.The inflator in the unit is excellent. The air pressure gauge is small but readable with its light and accurate. I checked it with a hand held pressure gauge.The Electromate is heavy but not prohibitively so; it's certainly not a strain to carry it about.Overall this is a nice unit, with easily understood controls. The jump start cables aren't attached to the unit, not a problem for me. Extra inflator nozzles are included but aren't attached to the unit as they are on the Energizer.One feature this unit has that is not on the Energizer and some others is the vehicle alternator voltage tester.When the weather gets nasty this winter, I plan on carrying the Black and Decker or the Energizer with me just in case.UPDATE - I've noticed that this unit doesn't hold a charge nearly as long as the Energizer. The charge on a sitting Black and Decker fades after a week or two.",1325203200,2011-12-30

The clamps are secure when attached to battery posts, and easy to remove.

If for some reason it fails, this one will meet the need but it is not an item I will be seeking out. The contour wiper has a lower profile with the hook lock attachment that my car uses but the obtrusiveness of the Delco (and Bosch) wipers is not an annoyance for me.The ANCO wiper is a lower cost item comparable to OE equipment on many vehicles. It's only been a short time and as a new unit it works without squeaks, streaks or smearing. As it is, I had it in the trunk of the car since it hadn't rained for quite some time and only after encountering a cloud burst a few days ago I stopped under an overpass and switched it with my current perfectly good Delco wiper. Obviously, the install is pretty simple as each of my cars employs the snap on hook lock system.  I didn't notice any discernible separation at highway speeds which may occur with some bracketless wipers. For whatever reason bracketless wipers seem to have a degree of separation at the very tip on the bottom of the windshield on the passenger side as they age and I do not anticipate this will be any different. As an aside, I noticed on a pre-owned vehicle lot the other day, virtually every car there had the same bowing at the tip of the wiper.The wiper filament of this blade is thinner than the Delco Clear Vision or Bosch Clear Advantage Blades so although I am confident it will be fine throughout the spring and summer, I am not sure it would last through the severe conditions of winter in my area. I also cannot comment about durability however just based on the differences in filament thickness I believe the life of this blade will be less than the others, rendering the moderate cost savings over the premium brands at initial purchase less significant.",1368057600,2013-05-09
5.0,"When it comes to washing a car, I think the most frustrating thing is having to dry a car somewhat quickly, especially if it's a toasty day!  This towel really does make quick work of drying!  With a HUGE span, you can dry off a car in 5 minutes, including all the nooks and crannies, and be on your merry way to cruise around in your freshly cleaned ride. ;)I personally would recommend people folding this towel so you have many sections to work with (and so it doesn't snag on anything!).  Start from the top and move your way down so that any excess water and be pushed down towards parts of the car you haven't dried rather than having water drip on where you JUST dried (now wouldn't that be annoying?)Good product!

5.0,"Can't compare to other compressors, but I needed one because a hose from my bike pump is short and won't reach one of the wheels on my car because its nose is always in upper position while three others are down, I probably need to lift that side of the car and roll the wheel so that the nose goes down and becomes reachable for pump's hose. All my friends and neighbors were surprised that simple bike pump from ToysRUS can easily pump my Honda Accord's wheels. But, for that small inconvenience and just in case to have an instant protection from flat tire I bought this compressor on a deal. It works as a pump when you don't use a sealant, PSI gauge is off but I have my own anyways. For this small compressor it does the job, not that fast - very loud when you're right next to it - but I guess all of them like that in this price range. Having a sealant feature in this compressor is just a peace of mind I guess. The only thing I wish it could do is to deflate - nice feature for pool toys that I carry when travel to pool with kids.",1323561600,2011-12-11

2.0,"Let me state up front - I was my car a lot and I mean a lot. Two to three times a week or more. I normally use soft cotton bath towels and change them out as I go so I always have one semi dry towel to remove the last bit of water. I don't have problems with this method as I clean my towels often and keep my car waxed so the system works well for me. No scratches or swirls.But...I thought I might be missing something so I got one of these towels and frankly I really can't see the point. While it might be softer than a normal cotton or terrycloth towel and does soak up a lot of water, it pretty much stays wet after that. You can wring it out, but it just spreads water after the initial use no matter how much you wring it. If you're going to use it as a first pass to soak up the majority of the water then I guess it's okay. But as your car starts to dry you end up putting more water down then was there when you started. Unless you have a bunch of these towels so you can always have a dry one, it's not any better than the method I use now.I just don't get the point or value in using these towels and they're pretty small too. I don't know that it will ever be part of my normal car washing routine, but it's unlikely. It's a nice towel, so I might find some other use for it as some point.I can't recommend this to anyone for it's intended purpose. Just use some good soft bath towels and save your money.",1403308800,2014-06-21

5.0,"KN 33-2370, I have KN's in all my vehicles.  This one is for a 2012 Camry and I'm sure it will fit the 2011 and perhaps the 2013.  In installing these in Toyotas you will see a cotton/carbon mesh filter that is not removable in the top of the airbox.  Its a post filter and I believe it has something to do with emissions on the newer Toyotas.  You can't remove this filter, nor should you.  Buy installing the KN filter you will eliminate the large cotton/paper filter in the bottom of the tray that is removable.  This filter is a denso brand filter typically, and is very restrictive.  When you get the KN you will notice that its not quite as tall as the OE filter and thats normal so don't be alarmed.After the installation, your computer will need to re learn itself and it may take as many as three key starts for it to understand that its now getting a bit more air.  I'd say within three days you would notice and improvement.  Some have noticed improvement immediately.  Most drivers with a tuned ear, will also here their engine become a bit more agressive sounding, this to is normal and will not cause damage.If your not running a flow through exhaust such as Borla or Flowmaster, the feeling of &#34;more power&#34; will not be as much due to the flow of air not being exhausted more freely.  However you are gaining more air on the intake side which is fine on its own.  You may also pick up some fuel mileage by installing the KN.  How much mileage varies on driving conditions and how you drive your vehicle.  When it comes time to clean the filter use kit 99-5000.  Clean the filter first as instructed, then allow it to dry fully, then oil it.  DO NOT over oil the filter- follow the directions.  If handled and cleaned properly these filters can go probably longer than the life of the car.  The filter by design allows more air to get introduced into the engine, and by its use of cotton and light oil, it captures more and smaller dirt particles that a typical filter would.  If you live in dusty conditions you will need to clean the filter more often than if its street use only.  These filters will not void your warranty and will help extend the life of your car.",1386201600,2013-12-05

4.0,"I replaced the worn out Bosch Icon Wiper Blades on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 with a new set of Bosch Clear Advantage Blades. The first thing that noticed is how similar they are to my last set of Icon blades. The Clear Advantage blades are almost identical to the Icon blades. The only major difference is that the Icon blades have a cover that closes and covers the top part where they hook on to the arm. The Clear Advantage blades don't have the same cover and it's open so snow and ice can get in it and freeze. When I compare how well both blades work I can't tell any difference at all. The Clear Advantage blades work well in the rain but struggle when it comes to snow, sleet and ice. I had the same results with my last blades. These wiper blades are just fine during Spring, Summer and Fall but I wouldn't recommend them for winter. They like to streak and not provide a very clean window surface for viewing when it comes to sleet or icy conditions.

5.0,I like these flat surfaced swipes much more than the contoured products available on the market because they distribute the tire dressing more evenly.  I am an automotive detailer and have minimal margin for error and these seem to be the best route for avoiding streaks in the tires from runoff and overspray on the wheels.  They work equally as well for both the gel and aerosol.  If you have the spray bottle/aerosol product I recommend spraying the swipe and then applying it to the tire with the swipe and not the tire directly. I highly recommend these and will not dress tires without them.,1331769600,2012-03-15
4.0,"I bought this dual horn kit from another outlet, but figured I'd add my review here. This was purchased for a 2012 Wrangler Unlimited. The stock horn is fairly weak and usually doesn't produce a reaction from anyone who has cut me off or drives 15 mph while chatting on their phones.The install was rather tight. I didn't remove the front grill and just worked from the top down, right above the driver-side headlight. I mounted one right to the bracket where the stock horn was, and the other was mounted in a nearby hole where a hood alarm sensor would be located. Since I don't have a remote start kit, the sensor was absent.I highly recommend that you have some type of magnetic tool to pick up dropped bolts. Unless you remove the grill, you will be dropping things. Also, the kit comes with nothing more than the two horns and 2 ground wires. I had to purchase the mounting bolts/nuts and decided that, rather than splice into the factory wiring, to make a couple of harnesses (see image). I used male blade connectors on one end of (2) 10"", 18 gauge wires, then used splice connectors to attach another 6"" wire to each of these leads. On all of the (4) remaining wire ends, I placed female blade connectors. It turned the wiring job into a simple plug-n-play operation, while utilizing the factory hot and ground.The horns are definitely louder and the dual horn tone cuts through like a champ. It does startle people all around me when I lay on it. That was the idea, so I'm really happy with it. Supposedly, they upgraded 2013 models to a dual horn. Some report that it's still weaker than this PIAA upgrade. I recommend this horn kit if you want to restore your horn's functionality.",1360195200,2013-02-07

4.0,"My son and I completed an 18 hour motorcycle training course this weekend, which included 10 hours of riding in the rain. Knowing the forecast was for rain I purchased this suit just for the training. Not only did we have rain almost 100% of the time, but the Saturday portion was with 10-25mph winds all afternoon.I'm pleased with the construction, design, and material used for this Rain Suit. Also the size chart turned out to be correct for me. I wear size L to XL. I ordered XL and it is large enough for me to wear over my jeans and a light jacket. Still the pants have sufficient elastic to stay up without a draw string.We were on and off the motorcycles every 15 or 20 minutes. Every time I sat on the motorcycle it was freshly wet from the rain. By the end of the weekend a little water had leaked through in the crotch and my jeans were slightly wet. I'm not sure how that compares with riding 55 mph on the freeway in the rain. Other than that I was perfectly dry.I appreciated the zipper legs which opened the lower pant leg up sufficiently to pull the pants on over my boots.The only annoying thing was the cloth covered bottom part of my helmet kept getting caught on the neck strap Velcro of the suit. I tried several times to adjust the strap so the hook part of the Velcro would be covered but nothing I did prevented the helmet from catching.For the price this is a good suit. It served my purpose this weekend. While I'm not likely to ride in the rain I wouldn't hesitate to use this suit for protection if I had to.",1391472000,2014-02-04
5.0,"Even the crappiest battery is great at first, but from research this one should well outlast the others and provide superior service, assuming ok treatment.  Check back in 7 to 9 years and I'll let you know if I was satisfied.  In general, discharge and lack of proper charging kills batteries prematurely, with temperature a small factor as well.  This battery arrived with 12.57V (resting volts) indicating 90-100% charge.  It has a &#34;12/13&#34; sticker, which I presume to mean December 2013 manufacture date.  I ordered it January 6th, 2014, so this is ideal.  Thanks to &#34;Everything-Aftermarket&#34; it came quickly and well packaged, though foam padding on the top would be a good idea instead of just packing paper.  The plastic handle is super-easy to remove and reattach, and the lead terminals are the pencil-style used by Toyota Prius.Prius in general tends to kill batteries prematurely due to lots of electronics which have functions while the vehicle is off, such as re-pressurizing the breaks before entry, venting the fuel system, always listening for the key fob, and sometimes powering the dome light or headlights, etc.",1389139200,2014-01-08

While I was conditioning a neglected stored racing saddle as my first project with the product, my husband asked me how it was working.

I have picked up other ones that are just the flat piece of metal and it's not comfortable at all.Tank doesn't leak at all and I was so happy with this I just ordered another one for my father!Only thing I did so far was put a quick disconnect on the unit so now I can use other attachments and I am going to be adding some little rubber feet for the bottom so when I put it down I don't keep scratching stuff... very minor thing but I think it would make it that much better.Only gripe is that it's 100psi tank and all others are higher rated.  The saftey valve is rated at 125psi and just like another reviewer wrote this tank is probably too conservative as far as rating.. I fill mine to about 115psi.  Held pressure all night with zero drops.The welds are nice and the blue is a nice looking color as well.  It's also light, so anyone should be able to pick this up.  Even the little gauge that comes on the unit (unlike what is pictured) is blue..lolEDIT:  I got a second tank because I was so impressed with the first one that when the second one arrived I was truely dissappointed.

5.0,"The ""Black & Decker"" unit does a good job. There's some kind of circuit in there that can detect when you've got it connected wrong, when a correct charge is underway, and when the charge is complete. When status is ""complete,"" the unit is not delivering current to the battery (I checked with an ammeter in series with a clip lead)This unit further can detect when it has become time to top off the charge, automatically switching back on again to restore a full charge.I use it on a trailer boat parked in the garage.  The outdrive has an electric circuit to prevent corrosion in salt water, and it will drain the battery in about a month unless I disconnect the battery or use this maintainer.  It works well.I've watched how the LED will turn solid green indicating a full charge, and, after a period of time, go back to flashing green to restore a charge as described above.The connection safeguard is pretty cool -- brushing the adapter across the carpet in the boat when it's slightly moist triggers the LEDs to indicate a bad connection. That's sensitive.I like that they include three ways of feeding the battery. Each method connects to the output cable of the charger.In particular, the 12V power connector (cigarette lighter plug) is an excellent way to backfeed a charge to the battery. For the boat, I don't have to lift the engine bay lid, un-do the plastic retention strap and plastic lid to the battery box to get to the terminals. For a car or truck, it saves having to put the clips on the battery terminals and perhaps leaving the hood slightly open.Just remember to make sure your accessory jack is always on, and not disconnected when you turn off the key to the vehicle.In the Olde Days the auto supply houses like Pep Boys sold little boxes called trickle chargers. They had a transformer and a set of diodes to take household current and convert it a voltage just a little bit higher than a fully charged battery.  This was a good match, because leaving it connected for a reasonable amount of time would typically not boil the battery and ruin it like a charger with higher current capacity would do. You also would check the level of battery acid every so often, and top it off with distilled water to compensate if the charger did cook off some electrolyte.With Digital Technology (insist on including the hype word in there, regardless of whether there's any digital circuit involved) the contemporary ""charger/maintainer"" can deliver more current than the old trickle type, but also can sense, electronically, when enough is enough and shut down. This means you can leave it on there for prolonged periods of time and not risk burning out a ""maintenance free"" battery whose cells are not easily checked for level anymore.",1374364800,2013-07-21

5.0,"I bought these to replace a &#34;Bad Boy Air Horn&#34; which had failed after only 2 years. The first thing I noticed was that they were really well made, and had a quality feel about them. The second is that they were fitted with a splash guard over the &#34;mouth&#34;, which I haven't seen on any other horns.Although these were very easy to fit, I was disappointed that the kit came with no mounting hardware, relay, or wiring, not a big deal, but at the price would it have killed them to have included a couple of nuts and bolts?Now the bottom line, how do they sound? Answer, great! They are as loud as the old &#34;Bad Boy Air Horn&#34; but they have a much better twin tone sound. Also, unlike the air horns you can actually &#34;beep&#34; these, which is great for getting someone's attention in traffic without resorting to a full on blast.Finally, as these were being fitted to a Toyota Corolla I opted for the 500hz/600hz high tone, and it suits the car perfectly.

5.0,"A lot of old adages ring true for the most part. The one that goes, ""You get what you pay for,"" probably applies here. The first thing I noticed was the price! Almost four times more than popular brands. Truthfully, I have never come across Griot's Garage wax - probably because it is very high end. Now I know where to get it.It's heavy. I noticed right away that it felt heavy for its volume. I hope that it's like electronic goods where heavy suggests higher quality. The can attaches in a way that keeps the lid on securely - somewhat like the way a camera's rear lens cap attaches.Finally we get to the product. Griot's claims to have the highest grade of carnauba wax. Looking at it, I would guess that it's more than just a claim. It is not as creamy or pasty as most canned waxes. It looks like soft wax, which is what it is. The consistency is somewhat like a harder paste wax, which means it can break off in chunks more easily. This has nothing to do with the performance or behavior of the product. It's just something I would want to know if I read a review.I'm so used to reading that one should let the wax dry, often to a slight haze before wiping it off. I was surprised reading that with Griot's, one should buff it before it dries. Not forgetting that a little goes a long way, I used less than I normally would if I were using a popular mass-market brand. I put a thin layer on the hood and then immediately began to buff it. I noticed that it went on easily and buffed just as easily. For products that require drying to a haze, it's a chore to get it off. You have to rub a lot harder. I was very pleased that finishing off with Griot's takes so much less elbow grease. I was on the verge of buying a random orbital buffer, but with Griot's I don't think it's necessary.There are two more things to consider - beading and longevity. Not too long after I waxed, it began to rain. After the rain, I noticed that beading was tighter than I had ever seen it with other waxes. Tighter means smaller beads. The beads were also clearly more circular. Tight circular beading tends to indicate a higher degree of hydrophobic properties. In other words, it acts as a better barrier or shield against water.It went on and off easily and the beading is great. The last thing to consider is the longevity. I want to finish this review so I will have to wait and see. If it doesn't last a long time, I will do an update. However, I would be shocked if it were not to last long. Carnauba isn't a famous car wax ingredient for nothing.",1367798400,2013-05-06

4.0,"When a neighbor doing some spray painting got some paint spots on my car, I first tried removing them using a razor scraper and water.  This worked, but it was pretty time consuming, and required a lot of care, so I decided to try Mothers California Gold clay bar kit.  The kit contains two bars of clay, a microfiber towel, and a spray bottle of Showtime Instant Detailer.I found that while the clay product does a pretty good job of removing dirt, sap, and small particles, adhering to the paint finish, it doesn't do much for removing paint spots.  For the uninitiated, using this product effectively requires developing a certain technique, particularly if you have a thick layer of gunk on your finish.Firstly, the surface you are treating should be cleaned of surface dirt, and cool.  The Instant Detailer spray is pretty slippery, and there is very little friction when sliding the clay bar across a surface sprayed with this stuff.  What you want to try to do is have a thin layer of the Detailer solution on the area, so you can slide the clay over the surface, but still get enough friction so the clay can pickup and remove particles from the finish.  If you have never done this before, it may take some trial and error to develop a technique that works.Since the clay is soft, it is constantly changing its shape as you use it, and from time to time, you will need to reshape it.  One thing to be very aware of, is not getting any debris into the clay.  If you accidentally drop the clay on the ground and happen to get a small rock, piece of metal, or other hard substance stuck in the clay, you could do some major damage to your finish, if you use the clay.  I store the clay in a small zip lock bag, and always be sure to have a zip lock with me when working, to try and keep the clay from picking up something that could be destructive.The bottom line is that the product works pretty well, but you will probably need to have a decent technique, and plenty of muscle to get the job done.  The process is not a simple spray on and wipe off, it will require some time and physical effort to do an entire vehicle.  The clay works on all kinds of finishes, but probably produces the best results on smoother finishes, as there is less friction.  Prices for automotive accessories at Amazon fluctuate and aren't always the greatest, so check locally for your best deal.  Hopefully this review was helpful.",1335052800,2012-04-22
1.0,"I own a previous version of this jump starter. My was made by UST and not Wagan. The exterior is identical to my unit so I assume it is made by the same manufacturer. I normally recharge it every two months even if I have not used it to maintain a full charge for when I need to jump start a car. I forgot to charge it for about 5 months and the unit is completely dead. I have try to charge it but when you press the battery status button, you can see the voltage just keep dropping. I have try to recharge it several times and I think the battery is completely dead. The charger adapter is also dead. I measure the output voltage and it measures a little over 3 volts. I take special care of my adapters so I do not damage the wires. This unit was only used several times to add air to several tires. It has not been used to jump start. Overall very bad quality.I also have a Vector unit which is now Black and Decker and it also was not charged for 5 months. This unit still had two red lights which indicate it was in good condition. I recharge it for several hours and it came back with full power. I also own Jump and Carry JNC660 jump starter. This is a professional unit with 1700 peak amps. It can hold a charge for months and still show plenty of power. This unit is the best but expensive ($130). This unit can jump start big engines and completely dead batteries.One other general comment for those people out there assessing which jump starter to buy. These lower cost, lower peak amp starters are only good for cars that has a weak battery (i.e. as engine is slow to crank over). If your battery is dead where the engine cannot even slowly crank over, these starter will not have enough power to start your car so do not blame the jump starter as low quality. I see such comments in other reviews. For a completely dead battery, you need a more powerful jump starter such as JNC660. I have the same problem with my Vector starter which has only 300 peak amps. It also would not start a completely dead battery. That was the reason I bought the JNC660 and carry it in which ever car we own that has the oldest battery. I need to buy another jump starter (I keep one in each car) and am thinking of buying JNC300XL which claims to have 900 peak amp and is about half the price of JNC660. The reviews seem very good and is made by the same company.",1266364800,2010-02-17

4.0,"After reading many reviews, I had originally decided upon the Innova 3160B. That is until I saw that the Actron is exactly the same as the OTC brand which appears to also be related to Bosch brand, so I changed my mind at the last minute and bought the Actron CP9580A. After reading so many negative reviews, I will admit I was reluctant and worried I might be buying a problem.I took delivery on my Actron yesterday, spent that evening reading the manual and connecting to the internet to try and update my programing. I read where the OTC website is the place to update, so that is where I started. I want to say that my office PC is running Win7 Pro and it would not change the programing into Actron and load on my Scanner. So I tried my laptop, which is also running Win7 Pro (both are 64 bit) and although it would load on my laptop, it still would not recognize my scanner. So I did what only other choice I had, go to Actron's website and see if it would work for me. On my office PC the program (OTC Scanning Suit 4.0 or Actron Scanning Suite 4.0) would load, but not setup or be recognized. Once I downloaded the Actron version onto my laptop, it fired up immediately, setup and recognized my scanner immediately also. The updated software was downloaded in 8 minutes (I also have the fastest download capability my ISP offers at 50mbps). Once I attached the Data Link USB to the scanner and laptop, it recognized the scanner immediately and asked if I wanted to check for updates. I said ""Yes"" and within a the 8 minutes, it was updating my scanner. Once finished, I disconnected my scanner and turned it back on to see what program was now loaded and it read ""SW ID: 6A4D) the newest and most current software is now loaded onto my scanner.I took the scanner out and tried it on my 2000 Mitsubishi, my 2008 Ford and my F250 Diesel. It appeared to work flawlessly. I am completely happy so far. After I've had it for a month or so and no problems arise, I will change my rating to 5-stars, or possibly down grade it is things start acting up in a negative manner. I do not know what or how the people that gave this scanner bad reviews did, but the setup and update process through Actron worked perfectly with no hassles or delays what so ever.I bought the scanner without the plastic hard case, only because I didn't see $40 bucks for a plastic case. However, I am very careful of my stuff, especially electronic gadgets. I don't drop, throw or misuse or abuse them. I keep them in a drawer with my other electronic automotive tools and if I won't need it for a while, I remove the batteries. To me, common sense prevails on the longevity of anything type of tool. I did download the .pdf manual and loaded it on my laptop and my office PC, so I can learn more about it either in the garage or in my office. I bought it for my Diesel, because my check engine light keeps coming on and I really don't want to pay the $800+ to have some clown replace the ICP (Injection Control Pressure) Sensor when I can do it myself for under a hundred dollars, including the part. So my scanner has already paid for itself.It may be a little early to offer a really good review, but after everything working out so smoothly so far, I wanted to share my first impressions. As of Day-2 of ownership, I am a happy camper! To Be Continued!",1370563200,2013-06-07

5.0,"This little thing works perfectly!  I use to use a pressure bleeder, but was concerned about what some people say, that pressure bleeders push more air into the brake fluid, which causes both more air and moisture to absorb into the fluid.  Best way is to press the brake pedal, or put a vacuum on the bleeder screws.  A vacuum would be nice, but also a lot more work to setup initially.Instructions say this check valve does not work on air, only brake fluid, but on empty systems you can still pump the pedal until fluid comes out, and run your drain side pipe into a container that has brake fluid at the bottom.  That way you only suck back up fluid, not air.  Once you have fluid in the lines, this is completely unnecessary.  Did all 8 bleed screws on a Brembo-equipped car, was effortless.  I completely trust this little check valve, hope it lasts.  Rinsed it out with simple green and then a little PB Blaster to keep it from corroding or whatever.Remember to buy a couple more yards of cheap 3/16"" clear hose from the hardware store, so you'll never run out, and can throw away what you've used after each brake job.The included hose clamp is worthless, but you don't need it anyways.Another great trick to compress pistons is to crack open the bleeder screw first, then push in each brake piston.  Fluid will go out through this check valve, instead of fighting every other brake piston.  Makes life a LOT easier, and does not push old fluid back up the brake lines or risk overflowing your reservoir.",1365465600,2013-04-09

4.0,"I installed these Wipers on my truck and it only took me a few minutes. My truck uses a hook lock to hold the wiper blades in place so it was just a matter of snapping the correct adapter into place, pulling off the old wiper blades and installing the new blades. While replacing my wipers I was comparing these new blades to my previously used Bosch Clear Advantage blades. In many ways they are very similar but overall these blades look slightly cheaper and the hook adapter is noticeably larger and stands out more. The size of the adapter isn't a huge deal to me but if I was deciding on which blades to purchase and they were both similar in price then I would probably go with my old blade because they look better. These have worked well so far and give me a clean and streak free window when it comes to rain. They aren't the best when it comes to ice but most wipers aren't. They remove snow effectively as well. They also have a indicator on them that turns yellow when it's time to replace the blade. Sounds like a cool idea but really shouldn't it be obvious if you need new blades because they will start to streak or break apart.

I believe there is something in the mechanics of this pump that prevent it from going over 60 psi as I have had another one these, very similar, if not identical viair pumps and it would do 90 psi on my 6 gallon tank no problemo.This pump is much quieter than I expected and I'm willing to bet that it'll have a passenger car tire up to 30 psi in no time.Also if you have a larger truck the extension cord is HIGHLY NECESSARY.

4.0,"A few years back, having suffered through an extended power outage and hearing alarmist reports of storms that coulda/woulda/shoulda been bearing down upon my area that were likely/possibly to negatively impact power availability at my home I went out and picked up a small power inverter to use in times of emergency.  Since that time (knocks on my own head a few times for luck) the power outages have been fairly few and I've not had to rely upon that little inverter for much of anything other than the ability to charge up some small electrical items (most frequently phones, iPods, iPads and the like).  That particular inverter offers at least one USB port, pass-thru of the 12 volt cigarette lighter port, and one standard (U.S.) 120 volt AC port.Seeing the availability of this 500W inverter, I somewhat jumped at the chance to grab another inverter figuring that I could just move the original inverter over to wife 2.0's vehicle.  That is easily possible, though I would note that in thinking of putting this Energizer 500W Power Inverter into service I have concerns about just how big this inverter is by comparison.  Relatively speaking, the inverter that I had been previously using was only slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes, or perhaps 2 or 3 standard sized Kitkat candy bars stacked directly on top of each other.  This beast easily dwarfs that one in comparison.  It's heavier, bulkier, larger and more demanding of space in my vehicle.  Certainly I can make the room in case of emergency, but if I am not going to use this regularly, finding it a home in the vehicle where I can still get to it quickly enough if needed is a concern.I wish that this inverter offered the pass-thru for the cigarette lighter port, though would note this is more obviously intended to be cabled directly into the electrical system in a more permanent fashion.Potential purchases should be aware that this device is not intended to power large devices, or devices with high power demands. For example, a blow dryer, microwave oven, or other device that pulls a higher level of power would overwhelm this device and wind up popping the device's fuse or fuses in the vehicle that it was connected in.  If you are looking to power more demanding electronics then please check through the entire line of offerings and choose one of these inverters that is rated for and intended for use for higher power draw levels.  For most typical usage (small electronics, laptops, iPods, iPhones, iPads, Android tablets, Kindle Fires, Android smartphones, etc.) this device would work fine and could/should provide plenty of on-demand power in case of an emergency or during road trips with this device in use.",1375747200,2013-08-06
5.0,"I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9""x9""x1"" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a ""column"" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating ""brick wall"" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these ""Stop'n Chocks""  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2"" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5"" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned ""brick wall"" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9"" wide ""rail"" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must.",1280880000,2010-08-04
5.0,"My husband groaned when I ordered this...""one more piece of junk"" were his exact words. You see, we have tried two or three of these in the past and each has failed to live up to expectations. One was roughly the same price and two were substantially more costly, so when this inexpensive little device came up for review, he was less than enthusiastic. I thought ""hey, what do we have to lose"" and went for it anyway.Glad I did because this one - despite the low price - delivers! In fact, by the next morning the spouse came to breakfast with this thing in his hands to show me all the reasons it was such a nice little device. We have a travel trailer and like many people, have to constantly mess with the battery..or worse, we forget about it. Yes, we have a battery tender and usually just end up taking the battery out of the travel trailer, hooking it up in the garage and leaving it there for ages OR forgetting and letting the battery run down more than it really should (the fate of our last battery). Of course, the price of batteries makes this less than desirable especially when having to shell out a couple hundred dollars each.Our current battery is an AGM so this was tested on that. It was down about 15% at the time this was tested. The day was sunny but had some clouds. We are in Florida so even during winter have a fairly long day of sunshine. We were both rather surprised how fast this managed to charge the battery...no, it's not as fast as hooking it up to electricity but def had close to full charge by that evening. We didn't really keep a close eye on it but the next morning when went to take a look it was already fully charged.It should be understood that this is a trickle charger NOT something you will use to jump-start a car. If the battery is really low (not suggested especially for AGM batteries) then it could certainly take much longer to restore. We are using this to maintain a charge in AGM batteries for a travel trailer and as such, it is just about perfect!The suction cups on each corner make this easy to attach to a window in the travel trailer for maximum sunshine then simply run the cables and viola'...done! Love the fact that it is then all but maintenance free. To be on the safe side, we went ahead and connected our usual battery tender to assure no overcharging.

Yes, it doesn't stretch easily over the head.  That said - neither did my other two.  I have no problem pulling this thing over my head onto my neck.

5.0,"I can honestly say that this is one of the best inflaters I have owned and I love it!!  It comes with several adapters to allow you to use it for inflating several different things (like air mattresses).

It has a fairly accurate built-in pressure gauge and a light.  But, what impressed me the most is that this thing is REALLY quiet.  I don't mean &#34;you don't need earplugs&#34; quiet, I mean &#34;you can carry on a conversation beside it&#34; quiet.  This really surprised me considering its small size and the fact that it's actually lighter than some others I've owned.

4.0,"This Wagan power inverter is a great solution when those smaller power inverters for your car just can't supply enough power.  A good example would be if you need to run a printer or a desktop PC in your car.  Electronics really need clean power, and the Wagan provides a nice source of power that more accurately emulates the sinusoid of wall power.  That being said, do you need a 400W supply?  The inverter comes with a cigarette lighter adapter and clips to put directly on a battery, but if you are going through the car's cigarette lighter, note that you can only go to 150W.  This is not a limitation of Wagan, but a limitation of your car.  If you intend to use your cigarette lighter only, then buy a smaller inverter.The one downside is that I noticed the internal fan is a little noisy, especially under heavy load.  From what I can tell however, this is a fine choice for occasional needs of higher power such as a printer, desktop PC, or small television so long as you connect it directly to the car power system and don't use the lighter.",1376092800,2013-08-10

4.0,"I got this scanner to replace another Actron scanner I had which was damaged. The Actron scanner was 50% more expensive then this Innova scanner.I find this scanner quite a bit better visually... first, the screen is MUCH easier to see. I remember using the Actron in any sort of sunlight required twisting, turning and shielding the unit from the light in order to view the screen. The Innova screen has a backlight and is easily viewable at all times... I had absolutely no trouble viewing the screen at any time. Second, the Actron displayed information only about what option was selected, which normally required a lot of key presses to cycle through the data and find out what's going on. The Innova has icons across the top letting you know basic information at all times, such as engine monitor problems, MIL status, and the number of DTCs present. It also displays DTC information in a much more expanded and understandable format, while the Actron used a sort of shorthand to display the information as condensed as possible. If you're use to reading DTCs, this probably won't matter much, but for those who are less fluent, this would be a big improvement.The Innova is a bit more responsive and I find I can move through menus a bit faster then the Actron. I also LOVE the fact that the Innova would actually remember my vehicle, while the Actron would require me to enter the information each time... this is probably the biggest benefit the Innova has over the Actron, in my opinion.While testing the scanner, I disconnected various sensors and waited for the MIL to light up... upon doing so, I connected the scanner and it told me clearly what the problem was each time.I have three complains about the Innova though...First, the included 'software'. The unit comes with a USB cable which connects it to your computer. Upon connecting it, my virus protection came up with a generic malware warning and refused to allow it to run. I rarely have problems like this, so to be safe I installed it on another computer I no longer use. The scanner uploaded the software onto the computer, and installed itself, along with three other required programs. When finally finished, any attempt to use it simply sent me to a website asking me to sign up for an account. Anyone who's not comfortable with providing websites with personal information would be stuck here, as the sign up process included full name, address, phone number, email, VIN, etc. Getting through that, I was finally at their website, which showed me detailed information about when the scanner was hooked up to my vehicle. This would have been extremely useful had it been a program that actually ran on my computer, and not a link to a website... if I ever needed to scan a friend's car at their house, it would be nice to bring everything up on my laptop, but having to find a WiFi connection before doing so ruins what could be a great feature.As mentioned in the product's description, there are additional resources available at the website location, such as available recalls and technical service bulletins for my vehicle, as well as videos and detailed information on DTCs... access to this part of the website requires a premium membership at $20 per month or $60 a year. If you're like me and wants a scanner for the rare DTCs that pop up, you'll find the premium membership to be an unnecessary expense, and a bit of an annoyance as your constantly reminded of what your missing out on and why you should upgrade. It seems the growing trend these days with gadgets... buy the tool, connect it to your computer, but to make full use of it, you need a paid subscription.Second complaint, a minor one, the control buttons. My Actron's buttons were simple and you knew what they were for... up, down, left, right, back, 'enter', and 'help'. Navigating the Acton right out of the box was pretty straight forward. The Innova has three obvious buttons... up, down, and enter, but also has four other buttons... a red labeled 'brick' (turns out it's an eraser and will delete DTCs), a green labelled 'on' button with two arrows, 'DTC/FF', and 'LD/M'. I'm familiar with scan tools, but I was a bit lost when I first tried using it out of the box. Read the instructions first, and get acquainted.The final complaint would be another minor complaint, but worth noting: the construction. As nice as the unit is, the construction is one place where the unit doesn't compare to the Actron. The Actron I owned felt sturdy and could probably be dropped off an 8' ladder without damage. The Innova is made of a very hard plastic and would probably be cracked by a drop from the hood of your car. If your a professional that deals with a lot of tools being bounced around and dropped, I'm not sure how long this unit would last.Overall, despite its cheaper price tag, I'm a bit happier with the Innova rather then my Actron. The screen visibility and layout is much better and unit is more responsive and user-friendly when navigating, while providing the same features. I would only ask for a stand-alone program for viewing data on a computer, rather then having to sign up for and use a website account.",1371945600,2013-06-23

5.0,"Have used a California Duster for over 15 years on brand new and old car finishes, from black to white. This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness. Ya, it may last forever, but I buy a new one once a year - hey it's pretty inexpensive.Be the envy of neighbors, get one of these and be as amazed as they will.",1258502400,2009-11-18

For my car there is no ground shadow which is great.Cons: The bulb (H11) isn't the L-type.  So if you don't have a lot of room between the end and the dust-cap you may run into issues.

5.0,"I usually use this spray-on wax when washing my car between paste waxes.  It helps to keep the hand buffed look last a little longer than washing alone.  The wax can be sprayed on the car after rinsing while still wet.  It adds very little time to the rinsing and drying process and gives a great look.  When I purchased it, it was cheaper to get through Amazon than from Griot's direct.  This is not intended to be the primary wax product - some reviews have said the spray-on wax does not last long, only ""one or two car washes.""  The spray-on wax is intended as an enhancement and not a substitute for a proper waxing.  I have never had it streak, requiring extra effort to buff off.  I always use this while the car is still wet from rinsing, this seems to work the best and does not result in any streaking in my experience.It's worth noting that this is a gallon size refill.  In order to use this you will need a suitable container.  You can get the 35oz size of spray waxGriot's Garage 11098 Spray-On Wax - 35 oz.and a sprayer such asGriot's Garage 11022 Finest Sprayer.  When the 35oz spray bottle runs empty it's much cheaper to use the gallon refill.",1375660800,2013-08-05

5.0,"There's a boatload of code scanners to choose from so the question one might ask is: ""Which one?""  The answer, after two days of research and a follow-up day of research after ordering this unit, in the short, this one.  Why?  Because it hits the middle ground between price and features smartly.First things first, all of the units I checked out had many various negative reviews.  To me, negative reviews are very telling as what to expect.  The point, all the code checkers have negative reviews, not just this one.  I let negative reviews be my guide to the positive reviews, not the other way around.Second:  Over the last few days, I've had several contacts with SPX's (Actron) customer service to ask sales and tech related questions before buying.  My experience, to a one, each interaction was a positive one.  A positive consumer attitude might have something to do with this point as the folks answering the phones are human also.Third:  I asked a customer service rep about warranty issues regarding online Amazon receipts and was told there's no problem with warranty returns using an online Amazon receipt.Fourth:  I asked about available software compatible with Win 7/64 and was told that Win 7/64 software was expected a couple of months out.  Time will tell on that point.  If you're XP/2000/Vista, 32bit compliant, you'll be good to go.(As of 14SEP2011, Win 7/64 drivers ARE available)actron.com/downloads/Fifth:  I easily scanned, found and corrected (erased) the error code which caused me to buy this unit in the first place; 2000, Dodge Durango.Details:  The quick start manual is quick and dirty.  I was up and running in minutes, not hours.............Batteries are not included.  You'll need four AAA batteries on stand-by if you want to use this unit immediately on arrival.............The comprehensive, downloadable manual (pdf) is a hundred and eighteen pages.  Wow!............The unit scans many vehicles for Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) error codes.............The unit comes with a six foot tether that's easily connected/disconnected but it don't come with no case.  Bummer.  Of course, for seventeen additional dollars plus shipping, you can buy a soft case from SPX.  But they're currently out of stock.  I used an available case I had hanging around the house to give this unit the protection a piece of high-tech gear of this kind deserves.  Works great and saves money.  The six foot tether is long enough so one can use the unit while sitting in the driver's seat.  The code scanner a past mechanic used, had a two foot pigtail and he was stuck under the steering column on a hot sweaty day with me feeling guilty as if I were abusing my mechanic...........You can't download and install available software (Scanning Suite) if you're running Win 7/64.  Double bummer...........Restating, not compatible with Win 7/64.  Supposedly compatible with 32bit OS such as XP, 2000 or Vista.  I write supposedly as I haven't check out compatibility issues with any 32 bit OS's...........Unit looks good so it has a high cool factor...........I recommend getting an inexpensive copy ofOBD-II & ELECTRONIC ENGINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS TECHBOOK (Haynes Techbook)to augment this piece of gear's instruction set...........I also, recommend getting a Cable Extension, J1962m to J1962f, 15ft (144203) if you're wanting to scan from the engine compartment.  I ordered one that arrived today.If you're wanting a code scanner to keep you away from mechanic/dealership pricing, that hits the middle ground between being a full featured unit that's not, by comparison, overly priced (yes, this is a bit of a pricy unit), my opinion, this is the unit you want.  Remember to offset the price of this unit against legitimate mechanic fees (they have to pay their utility bills also) and the convenience of being able to scan, clear and correct error codes yourself via parts replacement.  And if you let friends and family members know you have one of these babies, your popularity index will immediately go through the roof.A final thought, if going on a roadtrip, I highly recommend throwing this unit into your bugout bag as when the ""check engine"" light comes on, you won't have to worry about what the light is trying to tell you as you can immediately pull over and find out what's up.  Very cool.Hope the above helps.",1305936000,2011-05-21
4.0,"I take full responsibility in not researching this enough but, this model just has a vent down button to allow you to drop the air pressure down to the pressure that you want. I wanted the &#34;hold&#34; function and purchased the wrong one. If you want the hold function then you want JOES PN# 32310.Overall, I am very happy with the product. I have measured it against other tire pressure gauges that I trust and is always comes out right where it should be. The gauge is easy to read and the rubber surround helps minimize drop impacts and marring a wheel if you happen to drop it on the wheel somehow. It is well made and looks very nice.

5.0,"I've used other Eagle products (their nano wax) with good results, so I thought I'd give this a shot since there was a rebate. So glad I tried it - it's the best shine my car has ever had! Plus,  no white residue on black plastic trim.There's one big catch, however - you can't let it dry or it's very difficult to buff out. You need to work on small sections. Wipe it on, then immediately wipe it off. A micro fiber towel works best for both application and removal. Working in the shade is an absolute must as well.One person can do it, but it helps to have two people. One to apply; the other to wipe it off. Working on my own it took me about 15 minutes to do the car (an Infiniti EX). Two people could easily do it in less than 10 minutes.I can't comment as of yet as to durability and longevity, but my car has never looked better. Even if it doesn't last as long as a conventional apply/dry/buff wax, it's so fast and easy to apply that I'll continue to use it. Highly recommend.",1289520000,2010-11-12
4.0,"I bought this because some reviewers said it cleaned up water for pressure washing . I found it restricted flow to much . My fault for buying it for a non recommended application . I have very hard water and a spigot that is unfiltered from my well . Put this on it and use that to hand water my plants . Works ok for that as the lower flow is no big deal when filling up the plant watering jug . Gave it a four and thought about a 3 because of how much it slowed down flow . Every time it is utilized it takes a while to get consistent flow and it is at about 1/2 the normal rate out of my well which is in the specs required for flow and pressure . it is my  belief this could be a issue  in the proper application also . Make a note that a $9 pressure regulator is suggested when RVing and not knowing the pressure of the systems one is connecting too . You will know if you needed one your hose will  burst . Good hoses are not cheap either and all us older individuals know it is worth having a good one that bends and coils easily  in any  weather .Note flow improved with use rather quickly . Once you get all the air pockets out this works well . Worth trying again for the pressure washer , will comment later after buying a second one to try ! This is the one to buy with the flexible extension .",1365552000,2013-04-10

5.0,"I finally got tired of having dirty wheels - with caked on road grime and brake dust.  These Mothers Detail Brushes work great.  I use `em along withMeguiar's G14324 Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Wash - 24 oz..  The brushes reach into every nook and cranny, even around valve stems and recessed lug nuts.  They even clean the metal logo on the center of my wheels.  Very cool.The bristles are strong and they don't fall out.  They do, however, take a real beating.  Hey, better them . . than my nails.  As a suggestion, I found it's easier to clean my wheels if I ask my hubby to remove them from my car and put `em up on a work bench.  He'll do this for me - if he's in the right mood.  That way I don't have to stoop.I also discovered that these brushes are great for cleaning behind my faucets, which is always hard to reach.  As a size comparison, the bristles are about twice as long as a regular toothbrush's and much firmer.  They're the perfect tool for the job.

They look good, they cover the windshield thoroughly and they don't chatter or make clicking noises when the blades reverse direction.

But they're pricey.Installation is a cinch, squeeze the center expander, push down into arm, and snap-- it's done. Very quick & simple.This brand is the perfect summer blade-- it's a bit less bulky and more streamlined.  Being that I replace the blades before and after each winter, this is a smaller more appealing looking blade for the summer, and saves me some money during my summer swap out.I may still stay with the Valeo for the winter swap, but I'm going to leave this on through the winter to see how well they hold up.

3.0,"I was initially surprised at the quality of this for being so cheap. I have purchased a few amazon basic items and have been happy with all of them. This headed seat cover is no different. instructions are a bit straightforward. it has an elastic band on the back to keep itself 'roughly' in the right spot. Instructions say you can leave it like that or use the additional tie down straps ( that also come with hooks). Straps are fine but are extremely short, so as most other reviewers have mentioned, have to use something like string or bungee cords to lock down if you really want it not to slide around. I have this over a leather seat which gets extremely cold in the winter, but it slides like its on ice if its not bungee corded down to the seat. Install was a joke, five minutes? maybe? Hardest part is deciding how you want to anchor it. Low heat works fine, its nice but has to be on for quite a while before its 'comfortably' warm. However you can feel heat after about one minute after you turn it on. High heat works really nice, extremely warm, I prefer this one, unless I am on a drive longer than 30 minutes, then switch it to low or just off because my car is really warm by then. Do heed the warnings, and unplug it while not using. It has a nifty red light on the plugin so you can see if you left it on/plugged in. The seat in my vehicle has side airbag, and 1 armrest(on the opposite side of the airbag) and i was able to fit this without modification to the seat as to not interfere with either one. So after all is said and done, I am extremely happy with my purchase. Does exactly what it is suppose to do and was a very reasonable(cheap) fix for my cold bum! Would definitely buy again.Edit on 2-1-14I bought this and it was delivered on 10-31-13 and as of today(2-1-14) it no longer puts out heat. checked the fuses and tried and multiple 12-volt plug ins and it will not work. I will probably opt for the professionally installed heated pads next time since it couldn't even last one season. rating downgrade from 5 to 3 stars as at least the price wasn't wallet shattering.",1384473600,2013-11-15

5.0,This product greatly exceeded my expectations.  My headlights look brand new again.  What a wonderful product!This kit includes the following:1 pair of latex gloves2 pieces of fine sandpaperCleaning clothsPretreatmentCleaner / PolishShine Restorer / ProtectorWe own a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally Edition. It has about 100k miles on it and it's in pretty good condition. However the headlights had become very cloudy and yellow over time. I have tried scrubbing them with various cleaning products and pressure washing and never saw any improvement. I had been considering purchasing a new set of headlights but I figured I would give this product a try first.The instructions were very simple and easy to follow.I started off by applying the Pretreatment to each lens and was amazed as the yellow grime melted off of the headlights.Then I used the fine 1500 grit sandpaper and wet sanded the front of the headlights and this seemed to remove anything that the first step didn't remove.Next I applied the Headlight Cleaner / Polish and after completion the headlights looked very clean but they just didn't have that new car shine.Finally I applied the Shine Restorer / Protector and instantly saw a huge difference. I ended up putting 4 coats on for the last step and I had to wait 5 minutes in between coats. The whole process took me about an hour total. I also noticed that I have enough product left to clean them again in the future. Each of the bottles is still about half full. I am out of sandpaper but I can get that at any hardware store.I took a before and after photo of my headlights compared the two and there is a huge difference. They looked pretty disgusting prior to using this product and now they look just about brand new. I would have had to spend several hundred dollars to get a new set of headlights. This product will give almost the same result for a very small fraction of the replacement price. It's well worth it in my opinion.  I highly recommedn this product.,1276300800,2010-06-12

They do seem to leave a little less lint than a terry towel which is a nice plus.I got the charcoal color and if they bled any when washed, you wouldn't notice it since they looked like a faded black to begin with.  I do like that the dark color won't show any stains but of course, I won't be able to bleach them if they get really yucky.

5.0,"My Lincoln used to start well, run rough for a few seconds, and kill. After the second or third try, it would run perfectly. It turned out to be a fuel delivery problem. The problem was a dirty or partially plugged fuel filter that restricted fuel to the injectors until the fuel pump had run for a few seconds. On most Fords that use this filter, the big Crown Vics, the Mercury whatever, and the Lincoln Town Car, the fuel filter is located under the car on the passenger side in a special bracket attached to the frame of the car. It is up on the inside of the frame ahead of the right rear wheel. As far as I know, Ford uses two types of &#34;quick connectors&#34; to attach the fuel lines to the filter. Either type is simple. You can find a &#34;how to install&#34; video on You Tube. This maintenance part is probably the first place to look if you suspect a fuel delivery problem.

5.0,"I've heard that you ought to ""clay"" the paint on your car to remove minute particles of dirt and what-not.  So I bought this kit and tried doing my 2010 Altima sedan (white).First off, there's a lot of clay in the kit.  As you rub it over the paint, the warmth of your hand causes the clay to flatten out and spread, so a small amount of clay goes a long way.  I did my entire car using about 1/2 of the supplied clay.  When I finished, the clay looked almost as clean as when I started, so perhaps my car didn't have as much embedded dirt as other cars.Second, the lubricating fluid, Speed Shine, smells nice. Again, a little seems to go a long way, as it evaporates slowly from the car's surface as you use it to lubricate the clay.  I used a little less than half a bottle for my car.  It also works well alone to remove bug dirt and other small bits of crap that land on your car, leaving a nice shiny spot where the crap was.""Claying"" an entire car is time-consuming but not hard work.

4.0,This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess.,1371859200,2013-06-22

5.0,"Keeping any leather shoes I own looking halfway decent can be a chore at best. I have some leather Merrells I use for everyday wear because I&#8217;m one for creature comfort and love them. I have used some Scotchgard Shoe Guard in the past, but apart and aside from protecting them, it doesn&#8217;t condition my shoes. They really need a pick-me-up now and then and the Leather Nova did just that. I cleaned them with a damp cloth and let them set a while before conditioning them with the Leather Nova.When I was finished I was some impressed with the results. The Nova appears to be an oil-based conditioner and readily absorbed into the shoes. I only had to put a small amount on the included sponge applicator to spruce them up. Mind you, the Nova won&#8217;t take out those creases nor cover up paint specs or stains, but the improvement was quite noticeable.FEATURES:&#9658; Easy to Use&#9658; Can also be used on Vinyls&#9658; Can be buffed to a soft luster&#9658; Eco-friendly&#9658; Contains no solvents or harsh chemicals&#9658; Water and rain repellantI have used a cream-like conditioner before and like that a lot, but I think I prefer the Nova because it is so easy to apply. The leather instantly absorbed the conditioner and I only had to buff the Merrells after letting them sit for a while. I didn&#8217;t feel I needed to reapply it a second time. I would not use this on suede, nubuck, or textured leather because it simply absorbs the polish and darkens the leather considerably, something you may not like.The smell actually was rather like old leather and was pleasant. It had no harsh chemical smell, but as with any product, application in an open area is a must. In addition to the improved appearance of my Merrells I especially liked the ease of application. The Leather Nova would be especially useful for reconditioning leather seats or furniture with a lot of surface area to condition.Sample provided for review.",1391644800,2014-02-06

5.0,"Plastic material is light weight and has been used to raise a minivan. Rated for 1500 lbs each ramp but have not tested to capacity. Low ramp angle does not force small engine cars to rev engine to drive up ramp. Owning standard metal ramps before with much steeper ramp angle, I was always concern that I need to rev up the engine to get car up the ramp. I may not stop in time and wheels overshoot stops and then have damage under body. That was my main reason for buying this ramp because of the much lower ramp angle. To accomplish the low ramp angle, the ramp has be to much longer in length. The two piece ramp make storage easy. High price but in the long run worth it. Note of caution. The first time I use it, the ramp was on a slight raised lump area and it left an indentation in the ramp bottom. Just make sure you are working on a flat surface since the ramp material is soft.",1337817600,2012-05-24

5.0,"I have to admit that I am a bit of a Griot's fanboy. I have been using the products for years, and my garage looks like a Griot's commercial. Somehow, I had avoided trying this towel for a long time, although I stared at it in the catalogs regularly. Like many others I probably thought it was too expensive for just a towel to dry the car with.I finally bought one, figuring ""I'll give it a try"". That was two or three years ago - and I've bought more since then and use them every time I wash the cars. I have two SUVs... one full sized and one medium sized. I can dry the entire full sized SUV with one towel, when using this amazing towel along with the Griot's Spray-On Wax.The fabric is soft and will not scratch your beautiful paint finish. It is also super absorbent. The waffle design of the fabric really soaks up and holds the water! But my favorite feature of these towels is the built-in (or should I say sewn-in) hand pockets. Each corner of the towel has a sewn pocket for your hands. It is amazing how much easier this makes the job.These towels will spoil you and you may never be able to use any other again!",1356048000,2012-12-21

Also, love the safety feature that it has where the throttle can still be used even in the lock mode.  So you can change speeds slightly with the lock on or completely throttle down even in the lock position.  the lock lever is easy to use when engaging or disengaging.

5.0,"Brought our Jeep Wrangler's floor pan back to looking like new and is affordableWe have a 1998 Jeep Wrangler TJ that has been passed down the family to our son.  It is in overall excellent condition, but there was one thing that went unnoticed over the last couple years... the drain under the fresh air intake does not flow well, causing rain water to pool on the HVAC system and eventually overflow. When parked on a nose-up grade, that pool overflows onto the passenger side's front floor pan.Since we have Husky Liners (Husky Liners Classic Style Custom Fit Molded Front Floor Liner for Select Jeep Wrangler TJ Models (Black)) over the carpet in the front (and in the rear too, actually), we did not notice the damp carpet underneath the liners until a few months ago... when I saw a little pool of water sitting inside the liner and investigated.We caught the problem in time; no serious rust, but a decent amount (maybe 40% of the pan) was covered in surface rust and here is what we did to bring it back to looking like new:1. Cleaned the pan with some Simple Green and dried it2. Brushed the heck out of it with a good wire brush until as much of the rust was removed as possible3. Vacuumed the rust dust away, then cleaned & dried it again4. Sprayed the pan with Dupli-Color Rust Fix (Dupli-Color RF129 Rust Fix Rust Treatment - 10.25 oz.) and let it dry, then repeated twice more -- lightly sanding between each coat and also after the final coat.5. Sprayed the pan with four light coats of Dupli-Color Emerald Green Pearl (Dupli-Color BCC0421 Emerald Green Pearl Chrysler Exact-Match Automotive Paint - 8 oz. Aerosol), an exact match for our Jeep, with a light sanding between coats but not after the final one.6. Sprayed the pan with three coats of this Dupli-Color Clear Coat, which made the floor pan look like it is brand new, factory issued.  The spray went on evenly and coated well, and looked great after the first coat and even better after the next two.Am very happy with the results of this combination of Dupli-Color products, especially the matching of the color and the factory-like shine that the clear coat brought back to life. I checked on the floor pan again earlier this week and it still looks like new.If you have a similar need, we recommend this product and product line. Like anything worth doing, the end result is only as good as the intellect and elbow-grease that you put into it. My only recommendation, given the tight confines of working in the front floor pan area, is that you wear a good mask when using any of these spray-delivered products.Go for it.",1362528000,2013-03-06
1.0,"OK so these looked like they might be OK for the price and are made in Washington State (buy local thing).  I was terribly disappointed that a local Washington State company would claim these are waterproof (they know how it rains here).  These boots leaked buckets as the water ran off my waterproof riding suit pant legs right down into the upper part of the boots.  Within minutes of riding the boot was saturated.  The zippers also failed after about a week, the upper stop came off and the zipper just pulled right off in my hands!  Don't expect any support or protection from this boot either, it's front is sort of ""armored"" but the sides and the rest of the boot is very very thin material. Vega will not deal with any of these issues and say I must go through the dealer I purchased them from... however the dealer says they didn't make the boot or the claim of waterproofing so that's a warranty/advertising issue and to go through Vega. Catch 22 right?  If I ever get this resolved to my satisfaction (return for full refund) I'll post how much effort it took. For now I would avoid VEGA at all costs due to poor products and terrible customer service.",1322524800,2011-11-29

4.0,"I am satisfied with my purchase.  This unit is exactly as it is advertised.  It looses a star because of the inability at this time to replace the battery.  I am hoping that situation changes in the future though and that there will be an aftermarket battery for this.The unit couldn't be more easy to use.  I intend to charge this unit in the future via solar panels and haven't had the chance to try that as it has been overcast and rainy since I received my order. I have been testing it for a few days by charging it with the AC power pack though.  I find that the advertised power and times are accurate.The radio works fine.  The unit puts out the advertised power, the AC charger works as it should, and the cooling fan inside the unit is quite.So far, I used it to power a lamp in my living room for about 4 or 5 hours with a 23 watt cfl installed.  At the end of that nights use, I looked and the power meter said 40% left.  I did not confirm this with a DVM though, so I don't know how accurate that was.As far as build quality, it is fine.  Some have said it is ""much better"" than the ""cheaply made"" Black and Decker Electromate 400(which I also have).  That is false, build quality seems about the same to me.The only quality difference I would note between this unit and the BD is that the cooling fan on this unit is much quieter.Aside from build quality as looked at externally, there are differences to these two units.  The Duracell has a 28 AH AGM(Absorbed Glass Mat, which is the top of the line in sealed lead acid batteries right now) deep cycle, and the Black and Decker has a 19AH battery.  I can't remember if the BD comes with a Deep cycle or not,  The Black and Decker has one less AC outlet, a less robust AC inverter, and an additional DC outlet(which I find very useful to daisy chain these units together with in parallel).  The Black and Decker has an air compressor which is useful, and the Duracell has a radio which is also useful.I personally like them both.  We will see in the future how reliability plays out.For now, I have used every feature on both units and both units work as they should for their respective purposes.Mark :)",1255651200,2009-10-16

This Energizer charger works really well and includes an air compressor, with which I topped off all four tires (added 10 psi to each tire...I know I waited too long to inflate them) and it worked like a champ.  Only drawback this charger has is it needs an extension cord to charge it (spent less than $10 on a 12ft one from H--- D----).  This model has a built in sensor to avoid overcharging, so you can leave it plugged in until you need it without overcharging the battery.  Very happy with this purchase.",1291852800,2010-12-09

To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.

They still worked, however, when I used them, since the under wheel supporting structure on both ramps were still strong.Recently, I did discover how well these worked on a grass dirt surface, especially where I live with hard dense red clay.  They didn't move at all.I was happy until I discovered Race Ramps.Check them out.  They are much better and even lighter than the Rhino Ramps.  They have much higher back stops and they don't slip on either concrete, asphalt, grass or dirt.  They have s solid urethane-rubber coated structual foam surface and rated at 3,000 pounds for the pair.The only downside is that they cost about trice as much as the Rhinos.In the case of Race Ramps, you DO get what you pay for.The Rhino Ramps ar going away to a friend.",1330646400,2012-03-02

5.0,"These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72112 low tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!

The rubber is pliable and contours to my large curved windshield so I get a clean swipe every time. The Anco blade seems sturdy and rugged. You need that during the snow storms.,1367280000,2013-04-30
3.0,"I have used this same model cover on my bike for nearly a decade, and this is my fourth cover purchase.  They are fantastic quality and fit for the price!Storage indoors, and the cover will easily last 5+ years if you're careful not to snag it, as it will tear easily on sharp corners (mirrors, license-plates, etc.).  For the first 5-6 years of my bike's life, it was stored indoors, and one cover lasted easily during that period... where I live now, I don't have that luxury (yet).Outdoors, this cover will keep your bike dry and protect it from harmful UV damage for at least two seasons (mine started to fall apart after 3-years of year-round, outdoor coverage, but I also coat it annually with Camp-Dry to increase water repellent ability and UV protection).  The elastic does start to give out after a couple of years, but still holds the cover securely on the bike in high winds.Sizing:For sizing, The XL fits perfectly (slightly snug around the license plate and rear turn-signals) over my 1100cc Honda Sabre with 19"" windshield, large saddle-bags, and small tour-pack behind sissy-bar.  This XL fits exactly the same as the XL made 10 years ago, with the only exception being the snugness around the license plate and rear turn signals... I'd be happier with an extra inch or two of material back there.If I had to buy again, it would be a toss-up as to the XL or XXL.  My last one was an XXL and it was very loose-fitting, which caused it to flap in the wind, catch wind under it, and sagged in heavy rain, which created places where water would ""pocket"" on top or droop to the seat-level, eventually soaking through the material.  The XXL also covered (almost) all the way to the ground, which meant more chances of getting it dirty at the bottom or having hot pipes/engine touching the black material (not the heat-resistant silver).Design Change:The newest version of this cover also does not have silver running 360-degrees around the cover, as in the picture.  The black material of the top now covers down to the front wheel, and the silver starts right behind the forks.  This does help you to find the front of the cover in poor lighting, and actually looks much better when on the bike.Cons:My only real issue is that the material of the newest version of this cover is slightly thinner and more ""nylon-feel"" than ""cloth-feel"" of the ones made 10 years ago (or even five years ago), and the cover does not have the full Nelson-Rigg logo... missing ""More than just a Bike"" wording below the logo... no biggie, but having the full logo does make it easier to find the ""front"" of the cover in the dark :)  I do not believe the thinner feeling material affects the cover in the least, as mine has successfully kept my bike clean and dry during heavy snowfalls and torrential downpours over the past three months, and still looks like NEW.  We'll have to see about longevity... but if it lasts 2-3 years in outdoor conditions, I'll not be complaining!Update 6-8-14:When putting the cover on my bike today in anticipation of rain, the cover ripped as tension was placed over the windshield and mirrors.  The rip was not bad, but very disappointing to spend $40 on a cover that has barely held up to 6-months of use and very mild weather!  I will be contacting Nelson Rigg to obtain a replacement under warranty!",1389312000,2014-01-10

The bristles are long and soft, so no worries about scratching or overly harsh treatment of the wheels it cleans.The brush area is very large, so those who have wheels or rims with intricate openings may need an additional cleaning aid. My wheels are like this, and so I go behind this brush with a washcloth for the deep detailed parts of the wheel.I also wish the handle of this brush was slightly longer; another 4 to 8 inches would provide better leverage.",1397260800,2014-04-12

5.0,"UPDATE:  While I'm pleased with the light output of Philips H7 Crystalvision bulbs, after 11 months, both bulbs blew. I was vacationing in Maine at the time, so I picked up a pair of standard halogens ($15 each bulb with my ""Massachusetts discount"") and installed them, so I'd have something other than my fog and running lights for night driving, but the standard halogens appear dim to me.  I ordered a replacement pack of the Philips Crystalvisions and will install them as soon as they arrive in the mail.I cheaped out on the build of my Porsche Cayenne and didn't spring an additional $1850 for Bi-Xenon headlights, something I regret as I've had HID headlights installed on other vehicles and, although oncoming vehicles may not appreciate the blinding white light they throw, I feel more secure driving at night with them as roadway visibility is greatly improved.  After trying Sylvania Silverstar, which are roghly the same cost as the Philips Crystalvision, to find they didn't offer more illumination than the factory halogens, I considered an aftermarket HID conversion kit, but read that some conversion kits can cause damage to the wiring harness.  With that, I decided to skip the conversion kit and give the Philips CrystalVision Ultra bulbs a try.  Installation is the same as with any bulb with the fit being an exact duplicate of the OEM.  The light produced by the Philips Crystalvision bulbs is notably whiter (with a slight tint of blue) and brighter than the Sylvania Silverstar, which were an improvement over the factory halogen bulbs, closely resembling HID.  The cost of a pair of Crystalvision bulbs is less than even the cheapest HID conversion kit being sold on flea-Bay, but they are a direct replacement of the factory bulbs and won't cause damage to your wiring harness.  I've been riding around with these bulbs installed for about a month and I'm extremely pleased with their performance.  So much so that I'm planning to purchase a pair to replace the factory installed halogens in my high-beams, and eventually the factory installed H11 halogen bulbs in my vehicle's fog lamps.  Highly recommended.",1352160000,2012-11-06
5.0,Great setup for you bike.  Nice charging system for your phone which is also switchable on or off.  Love the indicator light that tells you when it is on and the tight cap that covers the unit.  Mounted it on my handlebars right next to my phone mount so my phone stays charged for the entire ride! The chrome finish really goes with the rest of the chrome on my bike.  I also hooked up the charging plug that comes with it but not sure if I will ever  use it since I don't have the extension to plug it into another bike.  It does exactly what it is meant to do and looks great.  Easy to install and I ran the wires under the gas tank and hid them for a very clean professional install.,1392163200,2014-02-12

And make sure that what ever you are spraying the protector on, is clean and dry and that your tape lines are straight.

5.0,"Disposing of the liquid waste from an RV (recreational vehicle) is probably the least pleasant part of the camping experience but it's necessary.  This kit contains almost everything that an RV camper needs to do that job in a single, well-thought-out, cost-effective package.1.  The tough Rhino Flex sewer hose in this kit compresses to a length of less than five feet but will stretch as long as fifteen feet.  Some RVs can store the sewer hose inside a hollow four-inch square rear bumper.  This hose will compress short enough to fit into such a bumper.  The bayonet fitting on the ""top end"" of the hose fits the waste outlet of the RV, while the other end has a permanently attached 90 degree fitting that uses the included adapter to make a water-tight fit with many modern campground sewer connections.  This sewer hose should stretch long enough to work at most campsites, but if more than one sewer hose is needed, this hose must be the last one in the chain.  End caps are also included that seal both ends of the sewer hose when it's in storage.  Then there's no dribble or drool.2.  The sewer hose support compresses to about one foot or will stretch out to match the length of the fifteen-foot hose.  A plastic carrying handle holds the assembly together for easy transport and storage.  Using this support to keep the sewer hose off the ground can provide a smooth slope from the RV to the campsite sewer connection to ensure a continuous, efficient flow of the effluent without pooling that can freeze in cold weather and cause backups.3.  Anyone, like me, who has tried washing a sewer hose by running water into it from a garden hose can encounter unexpected back spray.  That's definitely not pleasant.  The sewer hose end cap in this kit adapts a threaded garden hose to the ""top end"" of the sewer hose to provide a water-tight connection and shut-off valve.  This adapter, which should take no more than 30 seconds to attach, can give the sewer hose a vigorous final cleansing rinse without any unpleasant back spray or contaminating back wash.4.  RV toilets and black water tanks are far more sophisticated at reducing or eliminating unpleasant odors since my first motorhome trips more than forty years ago.  Even so, sometimes the black water tank needs outside help.  This kit contains a ""starter"" package of fifteen orange citrus packets to tame odors and help dissolve solids when necessary.  Just drop one into the toilet and flush.  Unpleasant odor goes away.5.  Although I usually useKimberly-clark 55089 sz; xl, sterling gloves [PRICE is per BOX] to handle RV sewer hoses, this kit includes fifty pairs of large plastic gloves in a handy, plastic stick-on dispenser.  Although these ""kit"" gloves aren't as tough as Sterling Nitrile exam gloves they are big enough to fit my large hands and are robust enough for one-time use when handling sewer hoses.In summary, most RV owners will eventually buy all of these items as they realize their need but they may come up short in the interim.  This kit is a reasonably-priced package that includes every item necessary for efficiently dealing with RV sewer sanitation issues except a black water tank washing wand.  In my experience Camco makes the toughest, most durable sewer hoses in the business.  If you've ever had an inferior sewer hose split and spray its contents, as I have, you'll agree with me that buying the best is a wise investment.  Camco claims to make the ""world's toughest sewer hose.""  My experience with their hoses (and others) supports their claim.",1382572800,2013-10-24

4.0,"First, I'm giving this product 4 stars because I haven't had a chance to test the durability of this product.  I may upgrade the rating later.I bought this product because my Ranger has a LOT of exterior vinyl.  Use the wrong wax and the vinyl will stain and sometimes it's not easy to fix..  Trying to avoid all that vinyl while waxing becomes very tiresome so when I heard that Meguair's Ultimate Liquid Wax (MULW) didn't stain vinyl I bought a bottle.  That this wax can be applied out under the sun is a nice feature as well.I bought this from Amazon on Friday and on Monday it was on my doorstep.  A Prime membership is one of the best investments I make each year.I decided to give this product a severe test and waxed several border areas making no effort to miss the vinyl.  A few minutes later I buffed it off and I was satisfied that this wax will be my go-to wax for transition areas at least.  The waxed vinyl appears to have a deeper color and is not shiny.  I also applied the wax to a portion of my repainted tonneau cover and it worked just fine coming off easily and without leaving behind streaks.  I could easily do my whole ride with this product if I wanted.There have been numerous complaints about MULW on detailing boards because of streaking and I'd like to say that streaks seem to happen when the product is applied too heavily.  Heavy applications waste product and make the wax difficult to buff. You have to apply a light coat and when I say a light coat, I mean that you should be barely able to see the wax.  If you can see it easily, you put on too much.Unlike the paste wax, the foam pad Meguair's supplies is pretty decent.  It's not a sandwich-type pad, that's to say two thin pads separated by an air space so I decided to use the pad.Proper pad preparation is important as well for a good result..  I put down a circle of wax halfway from the center to the edge and used my finger to spread the product evenly over the surface.  Once the pad had the wax completely covering the application surface, I added about three additional drops to the pad and began to apply the wax.  I did not have to add additional wax until I'd waxed the running board and two chromed wheels.  Another two drops was needed for two more wheels and a running board.  See what I mean about applying it thin?  Follow these instructions and you can do a whole car with about an ounce (probably less) of this wax and one microfiber towel for buffing.After I finished waxing, I put the pad inside two sandwich bags purging as much air from them as possible so that the pad will not dry out.If you apply this wax properly, you should be able to get 20+ applications out of a bottle.  If you're only going to use one wax, this product should be on your short list.",1398038400,2014-04-21

I will order more for my wheels are difficult to clean all the ins and outs.,1274832000,2010-05-26
5.0,"I would definitely recommend this if you need to glue some things in your car. My old 92 Mercedes is falling apart here and there, and I needed something to hold a few things in place. This did the trick, and it comes in a large tube that will last awhile. But, if you use some, I recommend you wipe the end of the tube out before closing it. If this glue comes into contact with air, it will become gel like, and harden.",1398556800,2014-04-27
3.0,"Oh, and the display can't be read in bright sunlight. That's the first thing I noticed when trying to use it, actually. I didn't know it was even on and working until I cupped my hands around the display to see that, indeed, my battery's voltage was in fact displayed. Very dimly. A better screen type would have been a great idea (in a garage, this likely wouldn't be an issue).This unit does two types of tests: one, with the car off, which tests the battery's voltage and (somehow) its cranking capacity. My van's 685CCA battery came in at 677, and got the green LED. All good there. It seems well built, and the clamps (permanently attached) are decent. Make sure you get a good connection to the battery posts, or the CCA reading will be inaccurately low (I had to adjust a few times to get it right).For part two, the charging system test, you kind of need a second person to do properly. One standing at the battery to watch the readout and control the test, and a 2nd person in the driver's seat to start the car, then keep it revved to 1200-1500 RPMs, and then turn on the vehicle's loads (hi-beam headlights + full-power fan + rear defroster recommended) for the load test. At each step, you press a button or two on the device to move it forward, and it doesn't store the voltage, so running back and forth from device to vehicle controls isn't ideal.The tester works well once you figure out how to navigate the device's menu and learn what the odd 4-letter contractions mean for various parts tests this thing can run (there's a cheat sheet on the back of the device). There had to be a more straightforward way to run through the steps though.Anyway, it's a handy device, and tells me more about the battery than just my multimeter did... but not that much more (just the current CCA cranking capability of the battery). If that extra bit of info is worth the cost of the device to you, then by all means get this tester. If you're okay just knowing voltage, and already have a multimeter, it tells you almost as much info as this device does, is far more ""all purpose"", and you can get one that will work fine for under ten bucks (harbor freight, etc).",1373328000,2013-07-09

5.0,"Phillips uses a smaller capsule to raise the temperature of their filament and thus make it burn brighter, plus has a higher-pressure noble gas charge to dissuade the filament from outgassing and burning out early. The end result is a bulb that lasts as long as and uses the same amount of power as what comes with most cars, but which puts out almost as much light as the 100 watt bulbs that are illegal to use on the highway and have a bad habit of melting connectors and headlight switches -- *without* the short life of the high-powered bulb, and *without* extra draw on your battery and *without* extra strain on your head light stalk switch (which is very expensive to change out if it gets melted). It's a no-brainer. If your car or motorcycle uses 9003 or H4 light bulbs -- or can be modified to use 9003 light bulbs -- buy these. You'll get more light on the road. And if your car or motorcycle uses standard round headlights or can be converted to such, add in the Hella euro-spec reflectors (which have better light control than US-spec reflectors to direct the light to where you need it rather than into the eyes of oncoming traffic) to get a lot more light on the road where you need it, rather than lighting up the tree tops like the US-spec reflectors do on high beam  (why does the NHTSA think I need to light up the tree tops?

The good news is that the rubber edge around the head did protect the wheel but I had hard time getting it out.2) It did not remove all of the winter grime, some tougher spots will require more elbow grease when my back is feeling better.

There are two choices - replace the parts for a huge cost (parts) or restore them with an over-the-counter product.There are lots of automotive products that promise the world and deliver nothing.  I researched this product and learned that it basically polishes the plastic back to a high gloss.  Just like preparing a surface for painting, progressively finer sand-paper is used to remove the scratches from the previous paper and gradually get the surface shiny again.The 3M Headlight Lens Restoration System kit has the following components:- P500 Discs (6)- P800 Discs (4)- P3000 Pad (1)- Compound (small packet)- Sponge- Drill PadThe approach to restoring the headlight covers is simple.  Use a drill to carefully rough up and gradually polish the surface.  Following the instructions, I masked off the surrounding area with a few layers of tape to prevent the sand paper from taking paint off.Then I set aside half of each grade paper for each lens.  I retrieved some extra paper of the same grades from my personal supply to start each round, because my lenses seemed really bad and I wanted to stretch the kit as best I could.I knew the process described in the instructions and the supplies provided to do the job would work, but I was still very pleased when I finished - they end result is amazing.  The key is not to run the drill too fast and to follow the instructions to the letter.

5.0,"I have been using a jointless wiper blade ever since it became a popular replacement for the factory jointed type that is usually pre-installed when you buy a new vehicle. The Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade fits the bills when you need to replace or just want to upgrade to a better performing wiper blade. There was no rain yet in my little corner of the country when I got this wiper so to be able to give a comprehensive review, I have to ""simulate"" rain-like conditions by turning a hose with a shower nozzle on the windshield in the driveway of my garage. Snow on the other hand is a different story, no way for me to simulate that kind of weather event.My thoughts:Performance: the jointless type Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade is contoured better to ""hug"" your windshield with minimal resistance and pressure points. This translates to better wiping ability thereby enabling you to see better in inclement weather. Since it is jointless, this type of wiper gives you uniform wiping pressure, eliminating the pressure points or the ""streaks"" that you see across your windshield as it moves across the windshield. The curvature of this wiper is aerodynamic, it will prevent a lift-off of the blade even in high winds.Installation: it took less than 10 minutes to install the Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade without using any of the adapters for my wiper arm.Very satisfied with how the Bosch 19-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade has performed. It is cheaper compared to other jointless name-brand wiper but gives the same amount of effect. Highly recommended!",1348790400,2012-09-28

You can't dry your ENTIRE car with the water blade but you can get atleast 75% of the vehicle completely dry.  I use the blade starting on the roof then working down the front and rear windshield. I have found that the blade works best on glass as it has the desing of a regular windshield wiper just softer.  I then move to the trunk lid and hood.  Lastly, I will do the sides of my doors, fenders, and quarter panels.  To get the hard to get places, like front bumper, grille, and other crevices I use a chamois.  The trick is to hold the water blade at about a 45 degree angle and do one long movement along the panel of which you are drying.

3.0,"I bought this because of its high percentage of concentrated detergent ingredient. I get my gas from a gas station where Top Tier 100% pure gasoline is sold.Maybe I did not need an extra fuel treatment but for peace of mind I used it.From among Redline products I also use D4 ATF.I have yet to do more MPG per tank calculations but the first calculation showed me that Redline fuel treatment has not added any MPG. With the treatment I got the exact same mileage I used to get without it. All other conditions being equal.I bought another bottle to try on our van. I hope to be able to get better mileage with it there.Even if I do not get higher MPG, I would not regret using it as a great cleaner. We do not even know now if Chevron Techron fuel treatment includes that specific detergent or not. No mention of it in the product data sheet.Does anyone know what 'pollution control valve' is in a car? Because here and on redline website it says 'Cleans pollution control valves'. As far as I know there is no such thing in any vehicle. If they mean PCV-positive crankcase valve, even then this is problematic since no cleaning can revive a dead PCV. It needs to be replaced and in many applications the price of replacing it is a few dollars at most. Anyone knows what redline and amazon mean by 'cleaning  pollution control valves' ?",1309910400,2011-07-06

5.0,"This is an excellent scanner for personal use and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  The unit comes in a nice, padded case, unlike myActron CP9580A Enhanced AutoScanner Plus with Code Connect, Trilingual, OBD II, CAN and Expanded ABS Coverage.  I do prefer the Actron over the Innova, but that is due to the software in the unit and my familiarity with the Actron.  The Innova is a solidly-built unit that works very well and looks like it should last for a long time.The unit immediately identified my vehicle and provided me with a readout of the particulars of the engine, transmission, etc.  No codes were found when I connected the unit, so I went through the menus and found that there are good number of tests and a ton of data at your fingertips with this unit.  I did O2 sensor tests, ABS tests, live data review, evap tests, etc.  The live data includes pretty much everything a user would ever need or want to know about the operating state of his/her vehicle.I really like the live graphing feature in this unit and I have been impressed with the other features as well.  I like the fact that the cable is not secured to unit permanently as with many scanners.  With my Actron, you will have to replace the unit if your cable is damaged, but the Innova will allow you to replace just the cord.  This may not seem like a big thing, but it would be a lot better to spend $20 for a new cable instead of $200 for a new scanner.The unit can be upgraded via the internet, so it should be fairly future proof for use with newer cars.I do feel that the menu is better on the Actron, but I am simply accustomed to that unit.  I can't fault the Innova at all, so my preference is not indicative of any fault with the Innova.",1369180800,2013-05-22

3.0,"First ... the product description on Amazon Vine said ""(package of 12)"", and there was only one piece.  I had thought this might be ideal for my tool chest which has several drawers to store different tools.  One package will do little to help or to decide whether it would pay to purchase several of these to protect the entire chest.I suppose it will depend on the pricing as well as how effective it is.  If it is inexpensive it may be worthwhile.  But my initial thoughts are similar to others expressed here.  I always wipe my tools down after use, and while those that go unused for a long time do show rust, it's hard to say that I would want to buy 16 shields (the number of drawers in my chest) and replace them every 3 months.  I have a hard time remembering to put chlorine in my pool every other day!

5.0,"I am reviewing the Autel MaxiScan MS509. I had done a considerable amount of research on ODB-II scan tools.  The big consideration was do I look simply for a code reader and reset device OR do I look for a real-time diagnostic tool.  I had no less than six different models from various manufacturers on my ""short"" list.  Previously in the automotive repair industry I was familiar with the protocols with OBD scan tool devices.  I spent time reading Amazon reviews, OBD forum sites, youtube etc.  [I went through a lot of Visine from staring at the PC monitor for extended periods!]. I went with this model largely on credible reviews, features and price. Amazon's price is respectable but if you dig into the issue you will be able to find one thru an importer.  I got mine direct from where they are made overseas [$60].I just received it and these are my initial impressions: Good heft and build quality, feels like a real ""professional"" grade tool, came with all the accessories you should need except 9V battery.  I hooked it up to my wife's '99 Jeep GC which is supported by SAE J1850 protocol and was able to quickly navigate the tool set up and DTC scan/test options.  The live data stream mapping is a great feature.  I will be trying it out on my '09 Dodge Ram which is CAN supported and should get even more information from that protocol.  This spring/summer I plan on scanning as many of my friends and neighbors cars that I can to get proficient with it.  I will make occasional updates as I work with this tool.  I know some folks have had issue with specific scan tools, the only bad thing about reading too many reviews is that after awhile one goes into ""information overload"" and you have a hard time making a decision.  So far I think this is a solid choice, I'm not saying there are not better choices so don't get all wound up if you disagree with me.  Tech. has come a long way from 10 years ago which was the last time I used a shop-owned scanner that my employeer paid $4500. for!  It was a Snap-Off brand and at the time thats what they were all going for, all the updates were with plug in modules [$100 plus each!] that you had to buy from the traveling tool rep.  Now updates are via the internet and usually free or low cost.  That eliminates the middle-man and his mark up but it reduces good customer service since you are dealing with a corporation five states away that does not give a rat's A@@ about you [usually].  I can't speak to Autel's customer service yet, but I did send them an email yesterday requesting information on the latest firmware updates available....we will see what the outcome is.  If anyone wants any other [specific] information I will do my best to answer.",1298678400,2011-02-26

5.0,"Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed.",1318032000,2011-10-08

5.0,"I purchased this to haul extra cargo behind a Toyota Highlander and I'm glad I purchased it.  We just used it for a 1500 mile round trip and it performed wonderfully.  I used it in conjunction with a hitch tightener to guard against bounce and sway.  I also purchased the Rolo LED tail light assembly that fits this carrier.  It held a cooler and several suitcases in a cargo bag very well.I used a torque wrench for assembly as directed, and things went smoothly.  I think that mine assembled a little crooked - either that or the hitch is a little askew, which is totally possible.  Regardless, I'm very pleased with the quality and build of this carrier.It is light enough for one person to carry and install.  Probably easiest to set the bottom on the ground and lean the tongue up onto the hitch before lifting into place, but feel free to install it however you like.  If you're feeling sporty you could try a sideways javelin toss if you have good aim and a steady arm.I'd recommend this to you if you want to carry extra cargo without climbing up on a step stool or ladder to load a rooftop carrier.  This is easy to access and it doesn't wreck gas mileage either.UPDATE 3/12/14:  Still a five star review from me.  I've used this a few times in two months and it remains easy and solid on the back of our suv.  After putting it in and out of the hitch a few times, the paint has chipped off the edge of the hitch attachment, which is to be expected.  Otherwise, no rust, and this has been through several rain storms.  We are very glad we have this for extra cargo.  We are getting a hitch extender that will allow us to mount a bike rack above it so we can use it when we go on vacation and take our four bikes with us.",1389052800,2014-01-07
5.0,"It's hard to beat Optima batteries for the amount of abuse they can take and how long they last.They also tend to take a lot lower temperature extremes, higher amp surges, and bouncing around vs. the average wet battery.I wouldn't recommend anything BUT an Optima in a rough-country offroad vehicle such as a Jeep, forestry truck, etc.I have a Jeep Rubicon fitted with a winch and offroad suspension & gear.  It gets bounced around HARD on rocks and rough roads, and run up and down at steep angles.  I drive it in the MN winter too.This year, after 2 years of 4-wheeling, and 2 winters, my 2 year old &#34;GOLD&#34; battery from the local parts house died.  It was 35 below zero and I really didn't want to worry about jump starting my Jeep.  Of course it was dead.  Too much bouncing, too much winching, and too cold = dead wet cell.I've had these before but they used to be way more expensive than the average truck battery.  Not so any more.  This was just as cheap on Amazon as the pricey premium battery locally.ONE PIECE OF ADVICE:  Amazon offers &#34;standard&#34; packaging and &#34;Frustration-Free&#34; packaging at the same price. I don't know the difference, but opted for the &#34;Frustration Free&#34;.  That just sounds better.  It came in a really nice, heavy duty box with cardboard padding all the way around, and plastic cladding on both ends.  Somehow they still managed to drop it and bang up one corner of my battery.  The plastic squared-off edge on the bottom was broken, but didn't appear to be through the cell case.  It didn't affect mounting it luckily.I can't imagine what condition it would have been in had I gotten the &#34;standard&#34; package.  Probably ruined.

I got 7 years out of the HD battery cus this thing is always on the bike when the bike is parked in the garage, a fantastic product, low cost top quality.

I have even used it in an emergency once for my car battery, where I left something on inside the car all week without realizing, battery was dead, rather then jump and possible cause a problem in the newer cars with damaging all the electronics in the car I put the Deltran on for a couple of hours and it brought the battery back to life to start the car.  This tiny thing charged up an Audi A6 battery which is enormous, and it paid for itelf over time by keeping my HD batttery good for 7 years!!!

5.0,"Before going to my review, I'd just like to say that this oil is available in 5 quart containers for substantially less money at Walmart. Walmart is the only retailer that sells the 5 quart containers. As for the oil, in my opinion there's nothing better. I used it in my 2002 Hyundai Santa Fe which I recently sold. Contrary to the recommendations in the owners manual, I changed my oil at 15,000 mile intervals. When I sold the car, it had 124,000 miles on it and the engine was as good as new. Throughout the many years that I've used Mobil 1 synthetic oil, I've never had to add a drop of oil to my car, despite the excessive mileage that I accumulate between oil changes. Now, I have a 2009 Toyota Camry and I'm doing the same thing. There are those who say that you have to change your oil every 3,000 miles. This is ridiculous. There are also those who say that changing your oil every 15,000 miles is insane. Well, regardless of what the experts say, I can tell you from experience that if you use this oil, you do not have to change it for 15,000 miles, period. There will be no damage to your engine and you'll end up saving a ton of money on unnecessary oil changes. The bottom line is that this is a great product and it works exactly as advertised. It deserves 5 stars.",1351036800,2012-10-24
5.0,"This harness is of pretty good quality components and appears to be well constructed.  I was concerned that it might be too short after having read some of the other reviews, but I installed this to 2011 RAM and was able to route the wire to the remote ballast by running it in front of the radiator which gave me a straight shot to the ballast and actually had a few inches to spare.  I have monitored the temperature of the wiring and relay and have not witnessed any unusual heat buildup. However, if you plan on installing this, or any relay harness to a vehicle with a CANBUS electrical system, you will need to add a capacitor/diode setup to stop the relay from hyper triggering or ""buzzing"" under the hood when the vehicle is running.  Although the HID ballasts will fire the bulbs, this is caused by the CANBUS system sending very fast, pulsed current to the relay causing it to engage and disengage very quickly.  Without this modification, I doubt the relay would last very long and would probably fail prematurely due to excessive coil or contact wear.",1371513600,2013-06-18

5.0,"I am a big fan of ""beam"" type wiper blades, which don't have external hinged arms. Not only do they keep a closer contact with the windshield, but they are much less prone to clogging with ice and snow. I've used earlier versions of the Bosch ICON on my wife's car for a few years and the new style looks to be even better. The rubber is more supple and there's a subtle ""wing"" air deflector molded into the blade, to help keep it on the glass at high speeds.With a good beam blade installed, you can skip switching to ""winter blades"" if you're in the snow belt - the ICON will do just fine. I also like that they seem to last longer than traditional blades - I usually get a full year out of these.One feature of the ICON I like, so far shared only with theValeo 900 ULTIMATEof blades I have tried, is the hinged cover over the mounting hardware. Not only does this make the blade easy to install, it also makes it easy to remove, unlike those with the spring latch you have to somehow get to release.Do make sure that you get the right size and style for your car.",1327795200,2012-01-29

The box is a much better storage container -- definitely a nice surprise.A heads-up: the weights are steel, not lead.  The reason you may care is if you need to use a half of a weight (I did) you'll need bolt cutters or something similarly effective to cut a weight in half.  The old style lead weights were easy to cut with nearly any cutting implement -- these are not.  This isn't a bad thing, just something to be prepared for.",1405209600,2014-07-13
4.0,"I was hauling out my 45 pound air compressor to fill up the tires, and this makes it 1,000 times easier.  It's a small unit, the size of a football, and it weighs probably only about 8 to 10 pounds.  The blue cord stretches out surprisingly long, and the main adapter screws down tight over tire valves.  You screw it on, flip the switch, and wait for the reading you want.  Easy.It does inflate a car tire rather slowly.  To take a car tire from 26 psi to 35 psi took me about 45 seconds to a minute.  That's not terrible, but it's noticeably slower than the pump at the gas station.  Still, you can do the whole car, even with moving the unit, in under 6 or 7 minutes, and that's not bad at all.  The gauge seems to be dead-on, and the unit feels heavy and well built.  With gas at $4.10 a gallon it's very nice to make sure the tires are rock hard and giving you every last mile you can squeeze out.I thought about getting one of those cigarette lighter jobs, but then I kept reading about blown fuses and so forth.

5.0,After using it on several camping trips this summer- I'll be darned it does work!  The fridge does indeed seem to cool down faster and maintain an even temperature much better than before.  It takes 2 D sized batteries which powers the little fan that creates a small breeze moving the air around in the fridge.  2 D batteries are supposed to last a month which for us is an entire season of camping.

3.0,"I bought two chargers - this one with 4 outputs to power my standby generator battery, my electric gate, and to charge my vehicle's D31 optima batteries for running my inverter.The other charger was a singe output, higher quality unit with much more power, and best of all it had a desulphating pulse mode which far exceeded this units ability to revive batteries.Each charger has its place.  For the 4 batteries, I have a 4 unit charger in an outdoor enclosure ready to hook up (with exentsions)For portability and ""need it now"" charging I have the fast and the furious charger (see my reviews for it's advantages over this unit).At 1.25A charging current x 4 you are only getting 15V x 5A or 75W of output for over 180 dollars, which is not a good value, so I subtracted one star.The connectors lack the weatherseal and are leaching copper in the recent rains, so I subtracted another star for thatI am overall much happier with my single unit charger's performance since I can select .75A - 3.5A with it and have the batteries topped off and desulphated at the end of charge.  This just sits at 13.2 VDC at the end of charge, which is good in its application because my gate needs some power to run the magnetic lock that secures the driveway.I needed 5 chargers, I got 5 chargers, and they each do their job.

5.0,"I usually have a lot of apps running in the background on my phone and I use Waze for GPS as I drive. Like most GPS apps I've used, including TomTom, it is intensive on battery use. If I have less than 80% of the battery when I plug it into the conventional car charger, I actually lose a percentage point each 20 minutes I drive when using Waze (yes, plugged in). Not so with this Energizer inverter! Running the same apps, including running Waze on my commute, the iPhone went from a 60% charge to 69% charge in 15 minutes on one test run. In another test run, while NOT using Waze, it went from 71% charge to 79% in 8 minutes. I never get this fast of a charge with a conventional 'fast' car charger. I'm using an iPhone 4S and my husband's 3GS was also plugged in on the second test run and he got the same results. The package states that it has a 'whisper quiet' fan - and they're not kidding. Holding it up to my ear, I can hear nothing. I have another older inverter that is a big, heavy rectangle. I was surprised how well this works and how light weight it was - no visible (or heavy) spikey heat sinks. The unit also comes with alligator clips for plugging straight to a car battery sans cigarette lighter port. The shape fits great in a cup holder and has cut-away areas so it can still cool with its fan when in the cup. The unit has built-in protections for your car battery.  If it detects a fall in power, it will turn itself off and the Red or Blue LED light detectors make it easy to spot what mode it's in. I am very impressed with this inverter.",1369785600,2013-05-29

4.0,"I live in an area with really hard water, so not only do I have to worry about spots if I don't dry my car after a driveway wash, even the automatic car washes tend to leave spotty residue. I've been using cheapest-you-can-get-me microfiber towels from a national chain of auto parts stores, with pretty good results, so I thought this would be a step up.In terms of feel, this towel is definitely thick, and almost chamois-like in texture. On the initial dry, it did a wonderful job, though, it did leave a few balls of fiber on my car. Griot's Garage makes pretty decent stuff (I'd argue it's at least as good, if not better than Meguiar's) and this towel continues their tradition of good quality.Sure, it sops up lots of water, but one of the things I desperately need this kind of product for, is cleaning around my windshield washer nozzles on my hood. They never, ever get cleaned or dried properly, and if you're not using the right cloth, you can ruin a fresh car wash.Everything was great, but after washing it, something changed. I followed the washing instructions to the letter, but it seems that this towel leaves some streaks now. My cheap microfiber towels don't do that, and I've washed them the same way. I like the towel so much, I'm going to pick upGriot's Garage 11078 Micro Fiber and Foam Pad Cleaner, and see if that gives my towel a new lease on life.",1367798400,2013-05-06

5.0,"These wiper blades are the flexible, non-metal frame style which I prefer. They have a wear indicator on each blade which is unique. It's a small spot on the blade which changes from black to yellow when it's time for new blades. (Be certain to remove the protective sticker from the wear indicator when you install the blade.)Each blade comes packaged with several adapters for use with different style wiper arms. The videos on this product page are EXCELLENT! Watch the one for your style wiper arm and you'll have no problem installing this blade.Note: Because many cars require two different size blades for the windshield, the blades are sold individually. Use the Amazon Parts Finder tool at the top of the product page to make sure you order the right size blades for your particular car.I used a water hose to test the blades when I initially installed them and they worked perfectly - no areas where the blades failed to make contact with the windshield. Luckily, last weekend we had some heavy rain and I was able to put them to the test. Again, they performed beautifully.Windshield wipers aren't especially exciting or interesting until they fail in a rain or snow storm.

I had a few concerns prior to purchasing this valve, and all concerns have been eliminated. I installed this valve on my 2012 Nissan Frontier 4x4 a year ago. Since I do a fair share of off road driving, I was concerned about debris hitting the little lever and losing all of my oil, but the valve is made in such a way that it is virtually impossible for that to happen. The lever has to be pulled forward (towards the front of the vehicle) and then turned downward to open the valve, so unless you are operating it, the valve will not open.Oil changes are a breeze. No tools required to drain your oil. I have put my truck through some pretty compromising situations off of the road, and this valve has no issues.

1.0,"Per another reviewer: AN EXPIRATION DATE?!?!? Give me a break. Mine arrived Dec 2012 and they expire Jul 2016, so I at least have 3.5 years to enjoy my purchase. Perhaps the resin gets brittle?

Fine for cars and trailers, not usable for motorhomes which will typically start at 30"" and go up from there. The tight curve of the chock means that the larger tire, even a 30"" or a 31"", hits the TOP of the chock first; and this chock's hard, slick plastic will not grab a surface like concrete or asphalt, so the tire just pushes the chock along.Too bad really, because it's a really beefy chock with a great ergonomic design, allowing you to easily grab it for insertion or extraction.

4.0,"X-Gear Solid Ice Scraper Mitts (2-Pack, Black and Red)This is a slightly different take on the classic ice scraper by enclosing a scraper within a plush ""glove"" that is also waterproof. The plush material feels like the stuff used in many winter gloves and Mechanix Wind Resistant gloves. It is a warm and comfortable polyester material. The outer covering of the X-Gear is a more water resistant cover.The scraper itself is a big drawback to the overall design. It is nothing more than a standard scraper design (flat tapered handle) tucked inside the ""glove"" and secured with a plastic tie. I confused this tie with the same type of tie used for labels on new clothes, the ones that fit through with a ""T"" and are supposed to be cut off. Well, after I cut the tie on my X-gear scraper, I noticed the scraper can now be removed from the ""glove""!After using the X-Gear for a few minutes on my windshield, the lack of ergonomics becomes very apparent. The ice scraper that I had been using had a much longer molded handle designed for comfort and reach. When using the X-Gear, it is essentially like using the small compact scraper but with a big glove wrapped around it.The material enclosing the scraper handle makes it hard to grip securely. The external mitt can be tight if a thick jacket is worn. I could feel the cold air seeping in through the mit. I felt that if I could wear my regular gloves, it'd be a lot warmer although the gloves could get wet in slushy conditions. The scraper mitt could at least dry out separately while I wear my gloves to conduct other business.The scraper blade itself is very good. It's very sharp and consistent, and made short work of the ice on the windshield.Overall: 4/5 stars. It does keep your hand rather warm and dry, but the scraper itself isn't that ergonomic. The ice chisel design is very innovative though, and comes in handy with surfaces like side view mirrors or the ice that builds up on windshields. I'd give it 5 stars if the scraper handle were designed better.",1353628800,2012-11-23
4.0,"The video for this kit is very useful. I watched it several times, finally pausing the video, taking notes to refer to while actually using the kit. Be sure to read the kit instructions too. I used the kit on a 1998 Mercury Grand Marquis.I followed the instructions exactly to maximize success, sanding for the full 5 minutes for each sanding/polishing operation. For the three grits of sandpaper plus the compound, times two headlights, it took a full 40 minutes of sanding/polishing. The headlight surface should be kept wet while sanding/polishing. Altogether it took me about 1  hour and 45 minutes to complete the job. One thing:  be careful not to use too much pressure when using the #400 (coarsest) grit sandpaper to avoid too-deep scratches. For the finer two grits and compound use firmer pressure. The video mentions this.There's a lot of rinsing and drying to be done and I used nearly a half roll of paper towels. Rather than a bucket or hose, water in a spray bottle works very well for rinsing; much better control.Not mentioned in the video, but in the kit instructions, is this VALUABLE tip: Complete the sanding/polishing/rinsing/drying steps first on BOTH headlights before applying the final step, the UV clearcoat. This avoids inadvertently wetting the  clearcoat (with drifting spray) on the completed headlight. Lay the coating on rather heavily, but not so much as to cause running or dripping. The coating must set for an hour in order to cure to the touch, and accidentally wetting it could be a problem. Also, it's MUCH easier to clearcoat both lenses at the same time. Otherwise the already-used blue applicator cloth will dry out in a short time and you'll have to refold and fiddle with it trying to create a neatly folded, usable application edge.Another tip: I cut the sandpaper sheets in half so I could use a fresh piece of each grit per headlight.I chose the Sylvania kit because it was the only one I found that has the protective clearcoat that  affords UV protection and long-lasting results. Although many kits make use of a drill or other power tool, hand sanding and polishing avoids possible wandering of the power tool and allows getting into corners as well as providing control and ""feel.""Bottom line: VERY pleased by the results. The lights don't look brand new (probably because the internal reflectors are not pristine), but pretty darn close and MUCH improved. For me it was well worth the money and effort. I gave it 4 stars because (for me) there are so many steps. But the very good results might well deserve 5 stars.",1347235200,2012-09-10

It has the footprint of about 2 1/2 milk crates (is that a unit of measure?) and is about 1/2 as tall. It's almost lost in the back of my CRV - and a CRV is not that large!

4.0,"After observing that my Radio Shack test leads don't conduct electricity very well, I decided to upgrade to this set. Generally I have been happy with my purchase but the large number of small parts is a concern. Extech provides tiny dust caps for many of the conductive surfaces, which should improve their longevity. While these are a nice touch, they are likely to get lost.  Additionally, the base cables are separate from the probes and clips, creating 12 separate parts.  Adding the slim reach test probes, which would be purchased separately, there will be a total of 14 items in the case.It would take a longer time period to truly evaluate this product as the corrosion resistance of the surfaces along with the durability of the PVC cables will be the key indicators of value. Meanwhile, the cables and probes appear to be well made.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the flared design of the main probes can be less than ideal in tight spaces.  So, you might want to consider purchasing the Extech TL743 Slim Reach Test Probe Set at the same time.  Note the term ""set"" in the case of the slim reach test probe set is a bit misleading because there are only two probes without case or cables.  They will fit nicely in the existing case.The Extech TL809 Electronic Test Lead Kit is a solid value.  There is some room for improvement, such as integrated caps, but this would most likely come with an increase in expense and some additional limitations.  For no additional expense, Extech should include the slim leads in the base kit and make the flared probes optional.  At this price point, this lead set is highly recommended.ProsNice carrying caseComes with probes, alligator clips and plunger mini-hooksDust caps on conductor surfacesConsToo many small partsFlared test probes too wide for some applications",1321488000,2011-11-17

5.0,This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible.

2.0,"OK, I purchased this for my bike, because I had a good experience with another accutire pressure gauge.But this one &#34;sucks&#34;. It worked ok when I first got it, but after 2 years the battery went dead and I only used it maybe 20 times. My other accutire pressure gauge is 10 years old and I'm still on the original battery. So I purchased a new battery and found out you have to take this whole thing apart, to get to where the battery is buried. So I take it apart very carefully, not to lose these very small parts and replaced the battery. So happy with my battery install, I go out to my garage and try it out and all I get is 1 psi on the lcd, so I try a different car, same thing 1 psi. This is a disposable item, when the battery dies you just throw it away and buy a new one. No thanks, I will keep using my analog pressure gauge.",1395792000,2014-03-26

When you pull it out of the bucket, it really just drains off quickly, so you have to hurry and get it onto the car.  Also, it's white, so it shows dirt and grime very quickly as you wash.  I was surprised at how much grit and grime actually stuck to the mitt, even though I was using the 2-bucket method.  It just didn't wash off in the rinse water.  My old trusty microfiber sponge worked better than this mitt, unfortunately.  And the grit and grime rinsed right off the sponge, but not this mitt.

5.0,"This tool is unique due to its triangular shape and slightly con-caved form to follow the windshield slope. The triangular shape allows the tool to get into low sloping areas where the windshield is near the dashboard.  How well it cleans depends on the material used on the tool (microfiber is best for no streak clean).  It does require a couple of swipes to get the glass totally clean, but it does not require a lot of effort.I found this tool so convenient to use that expanded its use from the inside of the windshield to the outside of the windshield and the sunroof.  I am fairly shot and cannot reach the sunroof as well as some windshield portion of the outside glass of my SUV without the aid of a step stool.  I found using this everywhere really speeds up the cleaning.The tool comes with two covers: a mesh one (good for removing bugs) and a micro-fiber (no streak cleaning). Because I use it everywhere I added a couple additional microfiber sleeves of my own.I purchased high quality microfiber towels and using my sewing machine attached strings (I actually used shoe laces cut in half) to all four corners of the micro towel.  This allows me to tie the ""sleeve"" to the head of the tool (see attached photo under customer photos).This weekend I found yet another use for this tool. I purchased Griot's garage glass clayGriot's Garage 11049 Glass Cleaning Claywhich removes deposits from the glass.  I was able to use this tool to rub clay against the glass where I could not reach the glass by hand.  This tool worked well because it is not totally flat but con-caved to follow the slightly sloped glass of the windshield, so it worked very well to hold the clay ball.Thumbs up for this tool!Ali Julia review",1339977600,2012-06-18

It was MUCH quicker and easier. I did the other light and redid the first one in less than 30 minutes. It got the lights on my '04 CLK looking almost new again.

5.0,"When I first looked up the size for my Saturn SL2, I found that the chart said a 20 inch size would work well for the passenger side.  When I went to the Bosch site, I found that it was recommended to get the 21 inch and I got upset.  I had already ordered the 20 inch size.The great news is that the wiper already on my car was 20 inches and this one fits and works beautifully.  The 21 inch would be too big anyway.  It was tricky to install at first, and despite being plastic in construction, it goes on well and so far has stayed on securely even in high wind.The wiper itself is a huge improvement over the other wipers that I have had, including Anco.  What I love about this wiper is that it hugs the windshield, but it also moves easily across the glass when there is barely any water on the window, or if the window is covered.The windshield is left very clear and easy to see through with no streaks or spots left uncleared in heavy and light rain.  I have not had any snow to evaluate winter performance yet.  I will update when I do.What I love most about these wipers is that they are SILENT.  No more squeaky wipers!  Everyone that has come in my car has remarked- ""Those wipers are completely SILENT!  WHERE DID YOU GET THEM?""I have to say they are the first wipers I have ever had which truly are silent so far after a few weeks of using them.

3.0,"These are decent, middle-of-the-road wipers. The rubber is heavy and seems like it will be durable. My old blade (a Michelin...looks almost identical) had started chattering and leaving a huge streak. Replacing it with this blade fixed the problems, but I suspect most new wipers would have. I did notice streaks near the edges of the blade, though, so this wiper isn't leaving as wide of a clear path as it should.If you have a car with ""opposing"" wipers (rather than both going in the same direction, they move towards each other, both attached at the lower corners), you will have to remove and rotate the attaching bracket in order to keep the ""spoiler"" on the top edge on your passenger side (this is illustrated in the OE version of the instructions, but not in the instructions for this UB version).  A bit of a hassle, but not a huge deal.The price seems a little steep, currently $13.45 here, with a MSRP of an astounding $28! I can tell you these are DEFINITELY not worth $28. As $14 wipers, I would give these about 3.5 stars.  For $28, I would expect something really special, which these are not.  They are just okay.  For $28 wipers, I'd only give them two stars.These wiper blades fit wiper arms with J-shaped hooks.",1367280000,2013-04-30

5.0,I was soooo....happy to see these here on Vine. I had a set on my conversion van and sold it and just had another brand of wipers on the car. I love these. The contour of them make them hug the windshield and keep it crystal clear with just one pass. I also noticed that when it was an icy windshield these didn't freeze to the window like most do. It was almost as if they had their own little antifreeze coating. I live in Iowa and even today we are getting another 8 inches of heavy wet snow and it's nice to know that these wipers will handle the load. I had them on the van for about 2 years and they still worked like the day I put them on. Can't wait to get them on the car...,1366588800,2013-04-22
5.0,"I frequently go camping with my kids (BSA).  One thing we always try to do is stay dry.  We usually succeed.  I like to use a fiberglass tarp over the tent to add that extra layer of ""waterproof"".

That's where these come in.There is a clamp on one end and a sturdy loop (for cord) on the other end.It is easy to use - just open the clamp, slip over the tarp and close the clamp.The clamp has ""teeth"" and a wider opening to accomodate the cord that is usually at the edge of most tarps.The clamp is very sturdy and will not come loose.Then you can use the loop to put cord or a bungee through and anchor to a tree or the ground.The material is very sturdy and to my eyes will not break.These will be very handy on most campouts, and could be useful at home if you have a car you want to cover or some other item to be covered by a tarp!",1336262400,2012-05-06

5.0,"I've used most of meguiar's products and while virtually all of them are awesome, this product is incredible, especially on a black, metallic vehicle.  I use a combination of Meguiar's spray waxes and detailers such as this NXT SPEED DETAILER on the several car washings I do after a full wax.  The NXT Speed Detailer will enhance the wax that's on your vehicle in the washings after you've waxed and it does an incredible job of doing that as the shine I've gotten from this detailer is better then any of the other meguiar's detailers i've used. The shine lasts for at least a week and it gleams incredibly.  The best part is that you can apply this stuff on the entire vehicle in 20 minutes or less.  And there is some protection this product has kind of like the spray waxes, but you definitely want to full wax every 2-3 months.  Another great attribute of this product is that if you have light dirt or dust on your vehicle..say a day or two after you've washed...you can just spray your entire vehicle and wipe down with a microfiber towel to get that just washed, gleaming shine, right on the spot.And per Meguiar's they say you can use this on windows and tires as well...although I use other things for my windows and tires...I may just try this on them for fun.

1.0,"I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks.",1395792000,2014-03-26

4.0,"For us this unit will serve mostly as an emergency power source for lights and for charging small electronics. The jump starting and air inflating features are bonuses and great resources to have.At first glimpse one can see the thoughtful design of the Energizer unit. The air, jump, and power features are clearly marked on the front A button to check available power is large, green, intuitive; unlike my Black and Decker power station, the color coded jumper cables are attached to system, one on each side. Each cable is designated with a large, readily visible plus or minus. For one not sure of the jump procedure, the steps are numbered on the Energizer with large numbers 1-2-3.Atop the unit is a lamp with flexible neck aglow with four LED bulbs.I haven't jump started a car with this particular unit yet, but I have used a similar unit for this purpose and it is wonderful to be able to do so without a second car. On brutally cold days, the Energizer will be riding shotgun with me.The portability of the air inflator is also very welcome. I've used units that plug into the cigarette lighter and require jockeying a cord while moving from tire to tire. Using this unit to inflate is fabulous. I did notice that the inflation is a tad slower with this Energizer than it is with my beefier Black and Decker 400 Unit.We haven't had a power outage yet so I had to simulate one. The Energizer powered a floor lamp for about five hours before losing steam. I had hoped for more juice. It also was able to power a small TV and a DVD player, but not at the same time. It could not run the power staple gun or an electric drill. A small cooling fan is readily audible when the power is on, but in a real electricity outage I don't think we'll mind the steady hum of the fan.The Energizer 84020 is great for the occasional jump start or as a standby to keep the car tires properly inflated - so much better than trying to find an air pump at a gas station. As a back up power source, probably not its prime intent, the Energizer is only adequate for light duty which is why I bought the Black and Decker to supplement its limited power. If I were to buy a third portable power unit, it would be something like the Duracell 600HD powerpack which offers 600W  peak A/C power.",1325635200,2012-01-04

I first put it on and felt pressure on my upper cheeks and was worried it may be too small, but very soon it broke in nicely.  There is enough firm padding to keep the helmet feeling secure yet comfortable.Unless there is some crash testing i dont know about, no one will know how well a helmet will keep a head safe, but I feel confident enough with this full face.Visor swapping i found very difficult and would not look forward to doing again.  but no need as i like the tinted shield.  It is difficult to see out of it at night but what tinted shield wouldn't.The matte finish doesn't provide scratch protection but what matte finish does.Even with the vents full open air flow is  minimal, that REALLY could be improved for summer use.The 2 gripes are the the chinstrap, it is a double loop that is a bit tedious to use as most loops are, but if one really wants to they can add an adapter, I just may.And its rather difficult to raise the visor being there is a very small lip for this, too small, and gloves dont help.That said not sure why i dont give it the extra 5th start considering the comparative low price.I suppose cuz its not perfect.",1376524800,2013-08-15

5.0,"The ultimate car cleaning is the use of a clay bar, or paint clay to remove contaminants and dirt that you can't even see. If you are someone who uses clay to deep clean your paint, you know what I'm talking about, and you may proceed to the third paragraph. ;-)Why clean your car with clay?? If you've never tried it - don't worry, that's a legitimate question. Here's why - micro-dirt, oxidation, atmospheric contaminants, etc. can all become deposited onto and embedded into the surface of your car's paint finish. After you have just washed and dried your car, run your clean hand over the surface (even better to use the back of your hand). Feel that grit? You can actually hear it... catching on the skin of your hand - yet you cannot see it. This is where clay cleaning comes in.  If you are new to using clay, I strongly recommend looking at some videos on YouTube on how to do it. You can't really `harm' anything, but you can certainly make a mess and frustrate yourself if you're not familiar with the process.  I will summarize the key points and steps for reference:- Starting with a CLEAN car, freshly washed and toweled dry (even better if you have stripped off your wax.. tip: Dawn dishwashing liquid will remove all the wax):- Tear off a manageable sized chuck of clay.  Something that will be about 3"" diameter when fairly flat is good.- Saturate the clay with Speed Shine - both sides. Don't worry about getting your hand wet, you'll be glad you did (or the clay will stick to your skin). Some people wear gloves - I do not. I like to feel the clay, and I know if it starts to stick to my hand it needs more lubrication. Lubrication is critical - the clay should always be WET with Speed Shine.- Working with small sections of the car (like a fender, or  of the hood, etc.) apply a mist of Speed Shine to the area to be treated.- Flatten the clay from a ball so that it forms a fairly thin disk. About 3"" diameter and "" thick is a good place to start.- Making sure the clay is wet with Speed Shine, lay it flat against the paint, and gently move it around the area you're working on. There is no need to follow any specific technique such as ""back and forth"" or ""up and down"" or ""circular"" - other than to ensure you don't miss any spots. DO NOT apply any pressure. Just enough pressure to control the clay is all you need, no pressing down. Re-we the clay and surface as needed. You will feel the clay ""grab"" or ""stick"" when it becomes too dry - spray it with Speed Shine and continue.- Occasionally lift the clay and inspect it. You will want to fold it over as it thins itself out with use - and/or as it picks up the dirt and becomes soiled. You don't want to drag the dirt back over the finish - so fold frequently to keep fresh clean clay in contact with the paint.- When finished with a section, use a mist of Speed Shine and a soft microfiber towel to wipe clean and lightly buff dry.- When done - some recommend re-washing the car. To me that is optional (you decide). But bear in mind that there is now NO WAX on your paint. You'll need to re-wax the entire vehicle now.As far as clay cleaning goes, there are two main parts - the clay itself, and the lubricant. I think most clay is about the same. Some are more or less pliable than others, some seem more porous - some smoother, etc.  I like the Griot's clay really well and find it easy to use. The amount supplied is very generous. I can get more than a year's worth of use from each container - often longer, depending how frequently I use it and how much stuff it picks up. The clay is nice and pliable, and I find it to be a good consistency - smooth enough to glide well on the surface and still porous enough to grab the dirt.  The most important component is the lubricant used. This is where the contest ends, in my opinion. I have used Griot's Speed Shine for many years. Not just for clay cleaning, but for nearly daily use to do a quick detail on the car, remove some light bird dropping or bug juice, etc. I even clean the glass (windshield too) with it. The stuff is just amazing. It will not harm anything - paint, chrome, glass, rubber, plastic - you name it, it is safe to clean with Speed Shine.If I could have only one product in my garage for car care, it would be Griot's Speed Shine. And for deep cleaning before waxing - the use of Griot's Clay is the best way to deep detail your finish.  Ten stars!",1357516800,2013-01-07
3.0,"These seemed to run a little bit on the tight side for me, but I didn't send them back because they're so close that I feel like going one size larger might end up being too loose. They seem like they'll be pretty comfortable after breaking them in. My first impression when I put them on was, of course, the snug fit, and also that the seam in the fingers of the left-hand glove were a little uncomfortable. The right-hand glove was very comfortable. After a few minutes the left hand glove almost started to feel like the seam was pushing into my index finger in such a way to separate my nail from the finger; this left my finger tip pretty sore as you can imagine. I also noticed that the seams on the left-hand glove were fraying a bit and that glove's wrist opening doesn't fit me snugly like the other glove does. Anyhow, I reported the problem and if I can get the left-hand glove replaced with one that fits as well as the right-hand, I'll love these.All-in-all, assuming most sets don't come with a defective glove, I'd recommend them.",1360022400,2013-02-05
4.0,The Fram Extra Guard oil filter is what I typically use on my car at oil change time. They are typically the lowest cost filter that isn't generic.

3.0,"The blade is good. The materials, construction, and water removal are all good. I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24"" factory one on the driver side. The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly. I rate the product 3 stars for the high cost not justified by any additional benefit over the factory blade refill.There two points I wanted to make are:1. Attention must be paid to letters -OE or -UB at the end of the blade model. I suggest using the Amazon fit guide at the top of the product page or visiting Anco website to find specific models that will fit your vehicle. I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment. My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the ""cane handle"" type of a windshield wiper arm. Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector. Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an ""OE-style spoiler"", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to. Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a ""cane handle"" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive. I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two. These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate). I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24"" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does. On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour). I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me. I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better.",1368576000,2013-05-15

4.0,"These 'miracle-in-a-bottle' things can get reviews from all over the place, both positive and negative, so I don't want to join the extreme voices here.  My experience is based on necessity since the winter fuel here in the northwest is so lousy that all of our vehicles start rough and burn hard.  The awful performance is most obviously when you need to suddenly accelerate hard and the vehicle misfires or stutters.So I tried a couple bottles of this Lucas fuel stuff in two or our rigs and the main thing I noticed was that things are smoother, as you'd expect in normal circumstances.  Now I bought the gallon version and am refilling these smaller bottles and using it full time (pencils out to be about a buck a treatment doing it this way) and it's been about five tanks.  Definitely smoother but not noticing any savings in the miles per gallon department yet.  Perhaps on long trips where it's mostly freeway mileage?  Don't know and really don't care.

I didn't need to do more than 1 as my camper is about 1600 lbs...It took me some driving and stopping to ask others why I didn't feel my sway bar was working to understand I was using it wrong.I had the sway bar to tight. The handle is very easy to turn and you can feel when it gets taunt. Over tightening it will defeat the purpose of using this item. It is NOT a stabilizer bar..it's a sway bar.. took me a while to get it...I prefer to have the sway bar for my small camper..plus it's easy to remove or even loosen..which you really have to do to turn around in tight spaces.

The sway bar is sup to allow your camper to do some sway just not very much sway. if you over tighten it, it will not work properly..when the wind hits you, both the camper and the car will feel the pull back and forth.. you don't want that.. you want the camper to be able to have some sway with the wind.

5.0,"This review needs to be prefaced with an important fact: I have no spare tire and don't have run flat tyres.I decided that I was sick of worrying about what I'd do if I got a puncture in a part of the country were 265/40R18's weren't common (these are for a Porsche, they're an extremely uncommon size).  I went on a bit of a tyre repair buying spree, buying this in addition to a giant bottle of slime goo and a more generic set of plugs.  My car did come with it's own tire goo, but I didn't want to rely on OEM tire goo as my only option.Well, I got a puncture last night that left my tire completely flat when I got back to my car this morning.  All of my previous punctures kept air just fine so I could get to the tire shop for a proper repair, but this one wouldn't hold air even with the screw still in the tire.I figured this would be just as good a time as any to try out this product, since the tire just didn't hold air at all.  Really easy to use, the instructions were simple and clear.  I highly recommend their suggestion of using water on the plugs, otherwise it catches on the tool.  I put the first plug in, and it was leaking air just as much as with the screw.  I put in a second plug and it let out just a little bit of air, but much less.  I thought I'd just leave it at that, but in the end I put a third plug in.  It was completely sealed up, and water doesn't bubble up on it.  That was about 6 hours ago, and I just checked and it's held the same pressure as when I filled it up at the gas station.  I took the wheel off the car because I was safely in a garage, but I could see doing this on the side of the road with the Porsche air compressor.This isn't an expensive or interesting product, but what I love about is that it gives me more confidence when driving my completely impractical car on road trips!  I'm buying a new set of tires (the puncture was on a nearly worn out set of tires), so I can't attest to long term reliability, but I can say that for punctures which leave the tire intact, this product can help you get to a place to fix your tires for real!  I don't know whether this is considered a long term fix or not, but I won't be using it for tires I plan on using on the freeway.",1363046400,2013-03-12

5.0,"For the price, you will not get a better quick detailer, nor a better investment to protect your car paint.  For me, ""quick detailers"" were a little confusing in their use and purpose.  So for those of you who don't know, they are meant to be used for two basic purposes:1) To protect your car's clear coat/paint.  Ideally you use this between waxing to maintain both the glossy newly waxed look as well as protection from the elements. The hydrophobic properties (water beading) serve as a visual reminder of that protection.  It's not as good protection as a full waxing and it doesn't last as long, but again, it's effective to prolong wax protection.2) Act as a cleaning agent.  This detailer can be used to get rid of a variety of stains.  I personally have used it to get rid of everything from caked in bird droppings on the hood to road splatter near my wheels.For me, I use it as a protectant only for touch ups on certain areas or after I clean up a stain.  I don't really use it on my entire car as a ""pseudo wax"".  The simple reason is that for you to safely do that, you really need to fully wash your car beforehand.  Otherwise, without a hose and car soap, you risk actually scratching your clear coat with all the dirt/debris while you apply this detailer.  And if you wash your car, then it's just not that much more difficult/time consuming to apply a wax right after (vs using this detailer), which is better protection anyways.  Although one time saving is that in waxing you need to buff out your car after applying it, which can take some effort to do properly whereas you do not with this detailer.  If you do wind up applying this on large areas of your car, just remember that you should try to keep it dry for 12 hours for the detailer to fully cure to maximum protection.However, as a cleaning/protectant for spot stains this is indispensible.  It's extremely effective and I always keep a bottle of this in my trunk because you never know when a bird is going to do its business on your car and you need to get those type of stains out as quickly as possible before they corrode your clear coat.Hope that helps!",1248998400,2009-07-31

3.0,"These are decent, middle-of-the-road wipers. The rubber is heavy and seems like it will be durable. My old blade (a Michelin...looks almost identical) had started chattering and leaving a huge streak. Replacing it with this blade fixed the problems, but I suspect most new wipers would have. I did notice streaks near the edges of the blade, though, so this wiper isn't leaving as wide of a clear path as it should.If you have a car with ""opposing"" wipers (rather than both going in the same direction, they move towards each other, both attached at the lower corners), you will have to remove and rotate the attaching bracket in order to keep the ""spoiler"" on the top edge (this is illustrated in the instructions) on your passenger side.  A bit of a hassle, but not a huge deal.The price seems a little steep, currently $13.53 here, with a MSRP of an astounding $28! I can tell you these are DEFINITELY not worth $28. As $14 wipers, I would give these about 3.5 stars.  For $28, I would expect something really special, which these are not.  They are just okay.  For $28 wipers, I'd only give them two stars.Note: When I ordered these, it appeared that they would fit my Chrysler, but they do not (I needed the UB, rather than the OE, version).

5.0,"There are two points that struck me to mention first.~ 1. The obvious ~ But in this case more critical then usual.Be sure to always attach the polarity connection correctly, red to red & black to black.General instruction: (pg 3) 'Incorrect battery polarity will damage the inverter & void the warranty.Do not open the inverter, there are no user serviceable parts inside.This inverter has 'reverse polarity protection'  by means of an internal fuse, but the instructions state:(pg 7 #2) 'Reverse polarity connection will blow the fuse in the inverter & can permanently damage the inverter.Damage caused by reverse polarity will void the warranty'~ 2. All WAGAN Corporation products must be registered within 30 days of purchase to activate the warranty.Replacement products will be in warranty for the balance of the original 2 year warranty.This is an nice inverter, with more available wattage then our family would commonly need on a road trip.But this is also handy to run our desktop computer (approx 300 watts) and a lamp (approx 100 watts)for a while during a power outage.It will provide a suggested 140 watts plugged in the cigarette lighter, (Not to exceed 150 watts)That amount will power a medium size LCD -T.V. (approx 70 watts) ~ OR a laptop computer (approx 90 watts)plus other items at the same time up to 140 watts.The inverter has a USB power port compatible with iPad & tablet, for charging mobile electronics,but this kit doesn't include the USB cable that would be needed.For additional wattage over 140 up to the 400 watts this inverter will provide,it needs to be connected to the automobile/boat/RV battery (neutral to ground bond for marine applications)~ 1. Included are two cables ~ a 42"" cigarette lighter/accessory adapter & 31"" long battery cable clips.There is adequate holding of the ring connectors on the threaded terminals of 3 1/4 turns when onlyone set of cables at a time are connected.~ 2. The inverter runs up to 90% efficiency which supports longer running time & greater care of the battery.~ 3. Inverter has Two AC outlets which provide up to 3.3 amps.~ 4. One USB port which powers up to 5 volts at 2.1 Amps.~ 5. Short circuit protection is by means of automatic shut down.~ 6. Overload, overheat and low battery protection ~ automatic shut down.~ 7. If shut down is preceded by a buzzing sound it's possible there's excessive load or a low battery or cable problem.~ 8. All inverters will automatically shut off when the battery discharges to 9.5 volts.This lower remaining amount of battery voltage will still start the vehicle.~ 9. For T.V. and audio equipment the inverter is shielded to minimize signal interference,but it may effect T.V. picture anyway.Wagan offers suggestions what to do, among others ~ move the T.V. away from the inverter by running an extension cordbetween the inverter and T.V.~ 10. To help reduce the noise caused by power conversion when using radio frequency devices ~connect an insulated copper wire to the ground terminal ~ and the other end should be connectedto a proper grounding point.Some examples are listed. The harmonic distortion is 3% which is rather high.A start-up load is approximately twice the continuous load which is why this inverter has a peak of 800 watts.Wagan suggests to determine if an item will operate with this inverter, do a test run.""This inverter will automatically shut down in the event of an output overload, so there's no danger of damagingeither the inverter or the equipment.""

3.0,"installed these on a 1985 BMW 325e. I had some difficulty installing them because the instructions were not clear. There is a little latch that you must open using a screwdriver or other object to pry it open. I ended up watching the installation video on Trico's website before I realized how they install. It still took me a minute or two to get the J-hook of my wiper arms to slide all the way in to the wiper blades so that I could close the latch and lock them in.They fit nicely and seem to work nicely, with no streaking, etc.The all plastic housing does not give me much confidence that they will last very long, but I guess that remains to be seen.

5.0,"i can't believe how simplistic this device is compared to the high end scanners and it just works. i mean what else could you ask for. its so simple. plug in, turn key, it auto detects the car's programming and if there is an active code will automatically scan. is very fast and effective. i used on 2 cars, my friends Pontiac grand am and my Pontiac g6. my g6 had no codes on it just wanted to see the difference. if there are no codes active it will not auto scan. however you can still manually make it scan, and it also can see certain things from your emissions systems. not everything but some things, but it really just tells you if they are working or not. if the programming is compatible, it can also pull the VIN off the car and as i found out, i can't on every car. my g6 it could see the VIN, while my friends grand am, it could not. still for the small affordable price of 20$ has already saved me 110$ in diagnostics fees. im sure will save me much more in the future. The other nice thing being, even if this thing broke after 1 use..... it cost 20$ and electrical diagnostic fees at a shop where i live are 110$..... even ONE use would pay for this product. and yes it doesn't give you a description of the code but who cares.... most the software in high end scanners has to be constantly updated to be accurate. it reads code, you type code in Google and presto..... you saved yourself a ton of cash. i like cash. if you like cash you can order too!",1343952000,2012-08-03

Since then I was having a problem with my water hose getting torqued and unscrewing itself and leaking. I decided to revisit this pressure regulator again as the coupling allowed it to turn freely and it solved my problem with the hose unwinding and loosening the cap. The coupling that leaked before on the regulator also leaked again, but this time I could tighten it better as it was more out in the open and was able to stop the coupling from leaking. I still haven't figured out how tightening it helped, but it's not leaking now. Problem resolved!",1315872000,2011-09-13
5.0,"While it might not be the most expensive (nor the cheapest) wax money can buy, it possesses a HUGE bang for the buck.At room temperature, it is kind of like a soft paste - not a liquid, not quite a paste. It obviously changes consistency with temperature. Making sure it is shaken up well is important, as there are more than one chemical at work here. In order to do this, you need to run the bottle under warm/hot water for a little while, to turn the paste into a liquid, and then shake it to get that smooth, thick, liquid consistency we're looking for.Once you get to that point, use it sparingly - I recommend dedicating this wax to a single applicator. I prefer the microfiber applicators from Chemical Guys over the foam applicators you can purchase. This stuff lasts a long time, so if it can lasts months on your car in the elements in a micro thin film, think about how long it's going to last on your applicator pad! It has a pleasant chemical waxxy-like smell. No frills here, it smells exactly like what it is. Hardcore wax.Whatever it is you're waxing, be sure to use a clay bar to ensure a proper, smooth, decontaminated surface. This stuff wipes on super, super smooth, almost like spreading vaseline. It's wonderful to work with, and spreads easily. This means that less is more - I figure since I did a full size car, including wheels, and glass, and yet the bottle looks as if it hasn't even been opened yet, this stuff will last at least 50 full size rigs before you need to worry about purchasing more. And that, is something I like!The nice thing about this is that it isn't one of these off-the-shelf products you can find at &#60;insert superstore/auto parts store here&#62;. If they did, it'd all fly off the shelves and it would be MONTHS before people came back for more. It lasts a long time on the vehicle, so long as the paint is in good shape before you apply it. The cleaner, smoother the paint - the better, longer lasting the shine will be.People rave about this everywhere you go, automotive wise. It's especially popular in fall and winter, because it compliments the rainy season well. It beads water like there's no tomorrow just by itself. And since it isn't one of those products that last about a week until the next wash, it'll keep protecting your paint through the entire season. Spring time will be pretty much pure awesomesauce when you go to give your car that detail you look forward to, and your time is cut in half during the wash process because it'll probably still be working great.Do yourself a favor and learn how to properly wax your car. If you're a nut that just loads the wax on until your car looks like the lady friend coming out of the day spa waring a mud mask? You need a little help.Wax should go on super thin. Using more product than is necessary is simply a waste of product. You should only see a thin, light haze once the product starts to dry. Use little to no pressure when applying, just enough to spread it out over the paint. Work in circles to ensure a good, even coat. Give it 15-20 minutes for the product to 'soak in' and bond with the paint, and dry - it's easier to remove this way, and yields the best result.Some people like to call it quits after you remove the wax, but to really give your paint that 'pop' most people look for (especially pearls & metallic paints), use either a quick detail spray such as Chemical Guys P40 or V07 as a follow up after removing your wax. This not only gives a bit more shine, it also adds another layer of protection that will lengthen the life span of your finish.I would recommend Collinite to anybody looking for a durable, high endurance wax that is easy to apply and practically fool-proof. It is maybe a 7/10 in the 'shine' department, so if you're looking for a top of the line shine, expect to pay top of the line money. But by all means put it over the 845 so when the super spendy stuff wears off, you still have the long lasting protection from Collinite.5 out of 5 stars because it's awesome, and everybody loves it - especially myself, since I'm the one that actually uses it. No instruction manual or Master's degree required.Enjoy!",1392768000,2014-02-19

How much do you really want to rub your paint to get the residue off (I have black paint)?  I haven't really seen any good protection from the elements or from birds/bugs.

Well, here's my assessment. It could be a good thing IF, and that's a very big IF, you wax first, then mask everything right. then spray perfectly, then let it dry (2 days at least!) then wax again.

4.0,"Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.",1364688000,2013-03-31

5.0,"Guys, I just got this trunk 20 minutes ago and opened the box..... To my amazement the package was packaged really well, the necessary components were well bagged... (I have a 07 Harley Road King) I am sure I will be getting a Quick attachment ($105.00 on Amazon) for this allowing me to take the trunk (The trunk seems to be well made, with a pretty nice lock on it) on and off really easy... The Trunk is a glossy Black, and paint ready as the backrest and the luggage rack is unattached. ,,, And my bike is red... I am deciding weather to paint the trunk red or leave it as is... Of course it will match the bike saddle really well,, and the included backrest looks great... It comes with a included rack,,, It has to be attached,,,, but it seems to be pretty good quality (The ones I looked at on Amazon and at the Harley shop cost over twice what I paid for the whole Trunk set up.... I gotta say I love it.... I can buy a spray paint can from Walmart for $5.00 and paint it red,,, am thinking of that....... I will post a update soon as I put the Trunk on my bike... I am very pleasantly surprised........Update: 9/22/13,,,,,,,,, Well I painted them a Harley Red hopping to match my Road King... Well,,, not so good, but it looks great. I got the paint at Walmart for $3.49 (Solvent type Rustoloum), got some 600 grit sand paper, to rough it up,,,, next thing I you know I have a red tour pack that looks presentable. Update: 10/25 I just bought the docking unit for my 07 Harley for $105.00 and will be installing it when the unit arrives. The trunk is exactly what I was looking for and about $500.00 cheaper than the Harley unit. Just had to paint it t....he bikes color,,,,,,, could have left it black though",1379635200,2013-09-20

4.0,"I followed all the steps carefully, and these turned out pretty nice.  My only complaint is that perhaps starting with 400 grit wet sanding was a bit rough.  You basically start with 400 grit, then move to 1,000 grit, then 2,000 grit, and then a clay type rubbing compound.  When finished, this kit included the critical final step and liquid UV sealant to finish the job.  The finished lights look pretty good, but there were still some apparent deep scratches that I suspect were caused by the initial 400 grit sanding.

5.0,"This is my go-to wax for 2 of my cars.  In essence, it is &#34;oily&#34; or at least it leaves the car looking wet.  Take note however that on a black car, this wax will actually attract dust.  It does look excellent for a few days but then I notice how the general dust seems to get settled more easily.  I use another Meguiar&#8217;s product for my black car now.  On my red and blue vehicles I stick to this wax.  Elbow grease comments?  Yeah only if you have done NO prep work on the vehicle before application.Couple things to upgrade any good detail job (I&#8217;m referring to the one and two star folks)&#8212;washing, drying, and throwing wax on a car will never bring out a showroom shine unless the car is new.  Washing, drying, and prepping the entire vehicle with a product like Meg&#8217;s fine-cut and in some cases medium cut cleaner is the ticket.  You can take out so so soooo many scratches, swirls, and debris that way.  Stay clear of &#8220;rubbing compound&#8221;&#8212;better yet leave it in the 80&#8217;s.  After you have used fine cut and the car almost looks polished already (remember you need to use a variable speed polisher&#8212;you cannot use this stuff with elbow grease), go over it with your clay bar just to make sure.  The vehicle should be smooth&#8212;no bumps, pits, etc.  If so, start with the fine-cut again and level it out.  Understand the Medium-cut, Fine-cut, and Rubbing Compound are all abrasives.  Think liquid sand paper with Rubbing Compound being the harshest next to actual sand paper.  Finally go ahead and use the wax.  Only apply it to small areas and then wipe right off with a microfiber towel.  I literately give the area 30 seconds to a minute to dry.  DO NOT wait for the wax to dry.  Follow the directions and don&#8217;t apply so much that you can&#8217;t get it off before it dries.Use only microfiber towels&#8212;don&#8217;t fool yourself with anything else.  Never ever ever ever apply wax in the sun.  Do it under cover, in a garage, or in the morning/evening only.

4.0,It works however it takes a long time for the newer batteries for motorcycles.  It did keep my battery good through the negative temps recently.  The best feature in my opinion is the quick connect.  Yes the cheap one at department store has it as well but this one floats instead of trickle charge.  I asked a professor at my local college I am attending and he said it is definitely better than trickle charge due to the trickle charge stressing the battery and chancing over charge.  The unit does get a little warm not overly though.  I highly recommend adding one of the extension cables so that the charger can stay in the house and the cable goes out to motorcycle.  I enjoy being able to plug into the bike and then the wall without having to take the panel off to get to the battery.  Also there are adapters that will plug into the connector for charging various items while you ride.  My opinion worth the money would have given five stars but felt the design was a little plain.

5.0,"I've been using the 60 LED version of this light for nearly a year.  The 80 LED light is virtually identical, other than being brighter because of the extra 20 lights.  When you first get your light the battery is powered, but I recommend you follow the directions and let it charge for several days with the light switch in the off position to fully charge.  There are 3 settings to customize the light to your needs.  One sets the length of time the light will stay on when triggered. Another sets the sensitivity- or the distance at which movement is detected to trigger the light.  The third determines if the light will come on at dusk, dull daylight or if it will only come on if it's pitch dark.  The dials are marked form minimum to maximum for each of the three settings.  I don't know if its just me, but I find the dial markings cryptic, hard to see and somewhat worthless.  The only way I can get it set up is to turn each dial fully to one extreme and wave my hand in front of the sensor.  If the light comes on in a well lit room and stays on for a long time and I know I want it to only come on when it's pretty dark and maybe not stay on the maximum time, I can turn the time and ""Lux"" dial partway the opposite direction.  For my use, I like the sensitivity on MAX.Once, I had trouble with my 60 LED light when it quit working for no reason.  I contacted the manufacturer and they did a great job of troubleshooting the problem.  The fix was to switch it off for a couple of days and let it charge and reset.  After doing that, I've never had another problem since.  Both of my lamps are somewhat sheltered under the eaves of the house but the solar panels are fully exposed to the elements and I haven't had any problems with water effecting either the light or the solar panel.I'm completely sold on these lights.

I use the orange ones for various levels of polish on my paint and I love how I can get into places on the nose and tail of the car that the 6"" pads don't do well with - or do at all.  They also work nicely around wheel arches and my rocker panels that stick out from the body.  Hand polishing is not my thing.  These work great and hold up well - and I'm not easy on them.  Be careful removing them from the hook and loop plate.  If you don't grab the back of the pad down by the connection you'll rip them in half.  I've been using them for about 8 years and they really make it easy to polish out ""areas and spots"" where I don't want to sit with a bigger 6"" Porter Cable or my heavier Flex buffers.I also use the red pads for applying wax in the same spots but like a white pad for less aggressive polishing.Oh yeah, I wore out my old buffer bought at Griot's and they REPLACED IT AT NO CHARGE AND SHIPPED IT FOR FREE!",1328486400,2012-02-06

5.0,"Just received my 2nd unit (for emergency backup).  First off, the first one I have is similar to the other photo that a customer posted here, that contain the ""white grip guards"".  The NEWER models do not have the white covers because the teeth of the grips are recessed (per customer service technical support), and can't make contact with metal or anything to short them out.  I purchased my first unit this summer, and now the new models are out with the upgraded recessed grips. Personally, I still like the one with the grip covers, mainly because I know for a fact they are covered. I'll probably place some small kiddie size cups on them to reduce my paranoia :)I have one I leave in my diesel truck, and the 2nd one I keep in my RV for using as backup power via 12 volt socket.  I haven't used any of these units yet to jumpstart my vehicle or anyone else's but I like how easy it is to charge this units, and the fact your can easily use it to power 110 volt equipment using an inverter.

4.0,"Summary - great inverter delives plenty of juice for power tools, but one of my chargers didn't like it :(I used aP3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitorto measure power consumption of the devices I used.Bosch 20V Litheon Charger - 49 wattsDremel 10.8V Lithium charger - 9 wattsGreenworks 40V Lithium Charger - 98 watts (wall outlet)Black and Decker jigsaw 135 watts (no load)  / 220 watts (Cutting 1/2"" plywoodPorter Cable Quicksand 106 watts (no load) / 174 watts (sanding w/ 80 grit)To cut to the chase, I was able to get both the jigsaw and the sander working at the same time and the Bosch and Dremel chargers never missed a beat.  That's a good ~470 watts of power tools and charger.On the other hand, for some reason the Greenworks 40V charger would start up then shut down.  I played around with the kill-a-watt and think it might be the line frequency.  The line frequency of a wall outlet is 60 hz, but for some reason the kill-a-watt sees this as 11 hz.  I don't think Energizer is really using 11 hz, but the kill-a-watt thinks it is.  This must be the same issue that causes the Greenworks charger to shut off.I did trip the internal breaker when I tried to run a heat gun.  The heat gun on low pulls 656 watts then quickly ramps to 874 - still below the surge, but the gun neve started up, tripped the breaker right away.Although this inverter has a cooling fan, it never seemed to kick in - either that or it's *really* quiet.  The inverter comes with two sets of connectors - cigarette type connector for lower power applications (Most cars use a 10 or 15 amp fuse, which means you can't run more than 120 or 180 watts before you blow the car fuse - DAMHIKT)  and an alligator type for hooking directly off the battery.  I did all my tests with the engine off - if you are planning to do some major work off this inverter, I suggest you leave your vehicle in idle so you don't end up walking.Mounting brackets just in case you want to mount directly to your vehicle - they do raise the inverter away for a cooling gap.",1378080000,2013-09-02

2.0,"Meguiars came out with the original NXT around 2005 and it was actually a pretty good product.  Not the greatest shine but was fairly durable and easy to apply.  Then, sometime a few years later, NXT 2.0 was introduced and to me, it was a huge step backwards.  Although it just received a highly favorable rating from the big consumer magazine, it is far from one of the best products on the market.  This version 2.0 has very poor gloss characteristics on dark colored cars and the durability is just terrible, literally no more than six weeks before water stops sheeting off the car.I maintain eight different personal cars and so am almost always waxing something.  I think all the high priced, multi-step products are just so much snake oil being sold at outrageous prices and trust me, I've tried almost all of them.  Good surface prep is the key to the success of any wax/synthetic product and that involves clay, light cut cleaner, polish and then the final way.  Once prepped properly, just about any product will do really well and, if applied regularly, will protect the finish and make future preps unnecessary.  My current favorite for durability and shine is Turtle Wax cleaner/carnuba although the good old Meguiars cleaner was in the purple bottle is still a darn good product at a bargain price.",1367452800,2013-05-02

I like to use a wedge of foam sponge to apply these types of dressings, that way the solution goes precisely where needed.

2.0,"I've been using microfiber towels for years. They are absolutely the best way to wash and wax your car. Before discovering the Heininger towels, I used the ""standard"" yellow ones. They do a good job and aren't very expensive. When I got the Heininger towels, I expected them to be very similar to the pile of microfiber wipes that I own. I couldn't be more wrong. These towels are actually different!I figured that microfiber is a commodity and that one brand is pretty much the same as another. This one isn't. The towels are noticeably thicker, softer, and more absorbent. One of these towels lasts as long as two of the others when I am drying the car. They wash clean on the permanent press washer cycle and dry on the ""warm"" setting on my electric dryer. At about $1.75 each, they are reasonably priced. Personally, I prefer the light colored towels that show any dirt picked up more easily. The dark ones tend to hide the dirt. A dirty towel can scratch your car's finish. Try these. They are absolutely great.NEW INFORMATION 5/16/2013Now that I have had these a while, some serious problems have emerged:1. These towels are not very absorbent. I have a couple of dozen of the basic ""yellow"" microfiber cloths. They soak up the water! I tried these and they didn't drink very much.

5.0,"I normally use Meguiar's Hot Shine spray.  It has served me quite well for the past few years but I figured I'd give this DUB spray a try.  I was hoping it would be even better than their Hot Shine.  The DUB spray does give tires a deep wet look.  Depending on how much you use, it could easily end up looking too wet.  I had that unfortunate experience and my tires looked exactly like they used to when I'd apply Black Magic silicone tire dressing back in the early 90's; messy and greasy.  It comes in an aerosol can with an adjustable spray nozzle but regardless of the setting, the spray comes out in a direct stream.  It took a little time to get accustomed to the narrower stream.  I didn't fare too well during the first application.  It felt like I used at least a third of the can to coat all four tires.  Afterward, my tires had the sloppy overly-glossy look described earlier and during the first drive, the excess was thrown onto my vehicle body despite the vehicle sitting stationary for over 18 hrs in warm temperatures after the application.  After a week of driving, I decided I wasn't really impressed and subsequently wrote a three-star review.  I did note how well the dressing withstood a heavy downpour and how the shine lasted very good for the entire week.  However, the original overly glossy appearance, excess kickback on my paint, and the nozzle's spray pattern seriously tainted my opinion.  I figured, I tried it, didn't like it and would resume using Hot Shine.Well, little did I know, I had yet to see the true capability of the DUB dressing.  The shine actually lasted TWO WEEKS.  I'm not talking about a barely visible shine.  My tires still looked as if a tire dressing was just recently applied a day or two ago.  They never dulled, even after a couple weeks of daily commuting and several heavy downpours.  My neighbor had his car washed and his tires dressed on the very same day I washed my car and applied the DUB.  His tires were dull a few days later after a couple of heavy rain storms.  After two weeks, my tires looked better than his tires looked the day he washed his car.  Now THAT caught my attention.  I had to admit I was thoroughly impressed.  I just washed my car again today and after applying the DUB a little more carefully, my tires look fantastic.  I also noticed the DUB doesn't drip and stain the driveway like my Hot Shine does.  Every time I'd pull away after applying Hot Shine, there would be four teltale greasy spots underneath where I'd sprayed the tires.  Well, DUB doesn't leave that greasy residue on the driveway.  After reconsidering how well the DUB performed, there was no justifiable way I could leave the original three star review intact.The DUB spray also smells very pleasant, but with all the unhealthy chemicals in these sprays, I don't think you should spend too much time inhaling the nice citrusy aroma.I can admit when I'm wrong and I was definitely wrong about DUB.  My first review stated I would continue using Hot Shine.  Well, I don't think I will be buying another bottle of Hot Shine anytime in the foreseeable future.  DUB has won me over.",1402185600,2014-06-08

4.0,"This Sylvania/OSRAM kit contains very high quality components and should not have a problem habitating in your engine compartment provided you keep it out of direct contact with the hottest components.How this installs is, in theory, pretty simple:There is a central processor about half the size of a deck of cards that has to be screwed or strapped down somewhere in the engine compartment. From this unit are long power wires that must get connected to your battery terminals, and one wire that gets clamp-spliced into your existing headlight wire. It is this wire that controls whether the LEDs are powered at 100% (daylight, no headlights on) or 50% (headlights on - presumably night). Out the other side is two sets of wires that will securely clip into your lamps once you position them.You then need to pick a place to mount the lights, with or without the mounting bracket that is provided. It gives you several options, but depending on your car, it could be tricky getting in there with a screwdriver to mount the bracket/lamp.I tested the wiring and the product by first hooking it up outside of the car to a spare battery. It worked great, looked great. Touching the green wire to the + terminal instantly dimmed the lights to 50%, or raised them to 100% when removed.So - great kit - everything is included... except perhaps mechanical expertise and magic fingers. That's where I went bad.These lights would have looked AWESOME on my 2011 Mustang and there is an empty cut-in place where they would mount almost perfectly (although they might be a little beyond the legal 10% angle). Problem is, with my bad back and the Mustang's low and heavy body work, I'd need a lift and a whole lot of patience and dexterity to get in there to mount these things. Add to that that the Ford wiring harnesses are so tightly wrapped and in a place with so little wiggle room, that I am not at all confident I could get in there. It looks like it would be even harder on my 2012 Focus, so these will be demoted to my third choice - the Dodge Ram where it appears installation will be pretty easy due to all the extra space in the engine compartment.Check your car - if it looks like you can get access to the headlight wiring and have a good and accessible mount point for the lights, you'll love this quality kit.",1375574400,2013-08-04

Then they promised to email the rma instructions -- which took several days -- but they sent the wrong ones (sent retailer instructions).... when i responded that the instructions made no sense - they finally sent the correct instructions.  while waiting for their emails my husband tested the adaptor w/ a multi meter to find out it was just the adaptor that was failed (and since they expected us to pay to ship the whole unit back we didn't want to pay to send back the whole thing) -- i requested if i could just send the adaptor -- (btw - their emails are also full of spelling errors and they could not get my name right),  it took THREE emails to explain to CS what an adaptor was... ! ... then 7 more for them to promise to send one...  that was july 7.  2 days ago i still had not received the adaptor - so emailed once again asking where it was... was told 'sorry it's being mailed today' .... this product is used the most during the summer for us - we use it camping and at the drive-in, picnics etc etc  -- and we have had no ability to use it (cause we cant charge it) for all summer... then after they promised to ship the part a month ago i find out today not only was it not shipped at all - it was sent snail mail today from California (across country to VA) after i asked them and 'reminded' them -- so the likelihood of us getting this time for our next use requirement (this weekend) is highly unlikely.finally - its sold as having a compressor capable of inflating truck tires -- it does not. it does not create enough pressure to inflate our 17"" truck or rv tires..  (we had to buy another dedicated compressor for them)A company is only as good as its customer service - and they have failed at every point for theirs.  not to mention a simple power adaptor should last more than 6 months.  the item is useless if you can't charge it.  I cannot recommend this product.",1280880000,2010-08-04

4.0,"I have two vehicles, both of which have headlight covers which were getting cloudy and yellow. The first is a 11 year old Jeep Grand Cherokee and the other is a 7 year old Subaru Outback.The Jeep's headlights were by far the worst. I honestly though my night vision was starting to go, because I couldn't seem to see the road when I was driving at night. Then I noticed that my headlight covers were quite cloudy, so most of the light was either being blocked or scattered.I tried the headlight restoration procedure, and tried it again. I spent about a half hour rubbing each lens, and the net result was only a very slight improvement. It is hard to tell, but looking at the lenses, it almost appears that there is as much cloudiness and yellowing on the inside as on the outside.So the Jeep effort was a failure. I ended up replacing both the lenses. It cost a few bucks, but at least my night blindness seems to be cured.The Subaru lenses weren't nearly as clouded, and it was more of a light haze over the front of the lens. There was no yellowing or discoloring. The product worked great on this vehicle. I spent about 10 minutes on each headlight, and they now look very close to new. If you look very close, there is still a slight amount of haze, but nothing like when I started. And I am not sure if I just gave up too soon, or if that haze is on the inside of the lens.=== Summary ===So I am happy with the results on the Subaru, and would recommend it based on that vehicle. The Jeep was a disappointment, but to be fair, I don't think that anything was going to work on those headlight covers.The stuff takes a bit of effort to use, but nothing too bad. The abrasive pads could have been just a bit bigger, but they were OK to use. Too much bigger and they would have been too large to work around the contours of the headlight.I have treated two vehicles from the contents of the kit, and there are at least two more treatments left before any of the contents start running out. Upon opening the kit, my first thought was that I had just paid for three pieces of emery cloth and some car wax, but the two spray bottles seem to have some positive effect on the polishing. The yellow tube seems to contain something very similar to a car wax, with a little bit of polishing compound mixed it.In short, for the price, I was happy with the performance. If you own a vehicle with basket case headlights like my Jeep, forget it...just replace them.",1372032000,2013-06-24
2.0,"I obtained this product from Vine.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the main functionality on this Michelin product leaves a lot to be desired.  It is difficult to seat onto the tire valve stem, lacking in this key point of ease of use.  The case is also a pain to open since it needs to be unzipped nearly all the way around in order to remove the tire gauge for use.  Otherwise, it is decent quality overall make and digital readout.For another vehicle in our household, we have the Accutire MS-4355GB Programmable Tire Gauge, which is a better choice (although more expensive).  The Accutire is very easy to seat onto the valve stem, has given consistent performance and held up for the last 9 months.",1375401600,2013-08-02

5.0,"This one filter has done the job in my 2001 Silverado for 13 years and 225,000 miles. I have never had the heads off, so I cannot comment on the condition of the cylinder walls. Does not burn oil and still runs great. I have not cleaned it as often as I should have. Have only cleaned it 2 times. So counting it being clean when installed, it's been without dirt 3 times in 225,000 miles. No evidence that any dirt ever got through it. Use the K&N cleaner and no other cleaners. Do not use hot water as it can shrink the cotton fibers making the filter look wavy. All of the dirt will wash out with ease. Let dry, I sit mine in front of a fan. Recoat with the K&N oil which is red so you can see that you have fully covered it. Put a thin coat of K&N grease on the neoprene seal and you are ready again. This filter maintains it low restriction to air flow, even when very dirty. I have these in all of my vehicles, not to save money, but because they stop dirt better and allow more air flow. Cars that sit outside sometimes attract mice that chew up the paper air filter and make a nest. Not possible with the oil soaked K&N.",1379116800,2013-09-14

5.0,"This is the 2nd TYC air filter I've purchased.  The 1st one was for my Honda CRV, which fit great, so I purchased this one for my Honda Fit.  Easier to replace than my old CRV.As others have noted, the TYC filter has three strips of glue and require an easy snipping of the adhesive on the opposite ends.  What you want is to be able to have the end walls separate from the rest of the pleats so you can seat the filter properly into the frame.  It is a very easy step, a scissor or a knife will work, you may even be able to tear and separate the adhesive with your hands if you are careful enough.  It's so simple, I wouldn't even dock it any stars.  So, on the Fit, open your glove compartment, take out all the junk you have in there, just squeeze in the sides of the glovebox walls, drop the glovebox lower (it's hinged so it won't fall off) and you have access to the cabin filter frame in the back.  Release the left and right clips and slide out the frame with the air filter.  Replace with new filter and put everything back together.Remember to note the direction of the air flow (I believe it's downward) and remember to seat the filter properly.  You should see a little ""lip"" like protruding plastic part on the frame (opposite ends).  Slide your filter into this part (both ends), you want to do so or there will be air that can possibly get bypass the filter.  It is because of this part on the frame and the full coverage of adhesive on the TYC filter that causes a conflict.Please let me know if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",1369958400,2013-05-31

5.0,I purchased this neat voltage meter (that's really what it is) a couple of years ago to keep track of the RV's battery voltage.  I checked it against a $300+ Fluke multi-meter I use at work.  They were within 1/10th of a volt of each other.  10 stars for accuracy.  I tapped into a 12 VDC circuit and  installed a 12 volt outlet in my Cougar Travel Trailer so that I could monitor the voltage at all times.  This meter has been plugged in there for two years now and is working flawlessly.  Highly recommend this unit if you want to keep track of the battery voltage and the voltage the RV's power converter is putting out.Update 9/6/2013:  Three years now in almost constant use.

5.0,"Though I am a big fan of Meguiar's, I didn't have much hope for this being any better than any other towel, but I am happy to say that it really works great. I am a bit nuts about taking care of my car, and I have added these towels to my giant bucket of car care supplies. After doing a standard two bucket wash with Meguiar's soap and microfiber wash mitt, my first step is to go over the whole car with an electric leaf blower. I keep my car waxed, so the water beads well, and the blower takes care of 90% of the drying work. I quickly follow up with the Water Magnet Drying Towel to get the few bits that the blower leaves. This minimizes the amount of rubbing I have to do, which (at least in my opinion) helps to prolong the life of the wax job. With this towel, one light pass over the wet spots is all it takes, and it leave a streak-free dry car. Since most of the water is gone after blowing it off, I never get close to saturating the towel, but I can tell from how much of the towel I do use that it will hold quite a bit. Even the part of the towel that has become damp is still drying in one pass. I can't speak for the $25+ towels, but I couldn't ask for a ""car towel"" to do any more than this towel does at only a few dollars. Remember not to bleach it, and not to use any kind of fabric softener, and it will be good as new right out of the dryer.",1373068800,2013-07-06

5.0,"These pads are simply the best out there for applying wax.  As another reviewer mentioned, they are basically a foam pad on the inside with a microfiber cloth wrapped around the exterior.  This literally gives the best of both worlds!  The foam interior gives the pad shape which allows for an even application of wax.  The microfiber outside makes sure that you don't scratch your car as you apply it.  Also, I've noticed that for liquid waxes in particular, a sponge applicator seems to absorb a lot of the wax into the sponge itself, which is sort of a waste.  A rolled up microfiber towel avoids this absorption but it is very unwieldy and it's difficult to apply a smooth and even pressure on.  Again, these applicators solves those issues by combining the two.  Also, these pads are a nice size, probably about 5 inches in diameter, which allows you to cover a large area very quickly.  I find the pads that come with many wax kits to be far too small, which just means more work for you to cover your car.  Finally, washing these out is a snap and each applicator is durable enough for many waxes.  Get these, you won't regret it!",1248998400,2009-07-31

I just installed it in my 2000 civic and I did not see any REAL noticeable benefit.After all the hype about increased mileage, increased fuel economy, quicker starts, etc, etc. I have yetto clearly perceive any real benefits from using it. I paid a arm and leg for it and cannot realize itsbenefits. For civic owners you can continue using the regular NGK plugs, just change them every 8 monthsand you are good to go. I will not waste any more money on snake-oil plugs like this.

5.0,"I just picked this up for the second car I've installed one on. Sure, oil changes aren't the most difficult thing to do, by any means - but these seriously help. I don't end up getting oil on half of my hand, and dropping my drain plug into the oil tray anymore, which is nice. Just watch your arms, keep them out of the way, and turn the valve. Drain away. No more needing to replace crush washers, etc, as it never gets removed from the car.The valve itself is all solid brass - so I highly doubt these will wear out very quickly. I can imagine that, over 10+ years, perhaps these will leak, but they've done some pretty solid testing, and I doubt that will happen while I own the vehicle.To recap - Solid, clean, saves me 5 minutes when I do an oil change.

5.0,"I've been a die-hard fan of Eagle One Nevr-Dull and thought this would provide the perfect test environment to put Griot's against.  I used it on my Harley polished stainless and chrome, and it cleaned them up BRILLIANTLY!  Don't get me wrong, I love Nevr-Dull and it's hard to do 'one better.'  But I believe the Griot's polish did a little bit better job than the Nevr-Dull, and -- this is the big part -- it's nice not to have to polish an entire motorcycle pinching a cotton ball.The hard thing about any polish is that it totally depends on how dirty something is to begin with before you can rate the performance.  I keep my stuff clean and it still took a bit of elbow grease, but nothing unusual.  Likewise, it doesn't take a lot of polish to get the metal sparkling again.In the end, this is a bit more expensive than Nevr-Dull, but I feel it's worth the additional cost.  I barely put a dent in this bottle so I know it's going to last a bit before I need to replace it.  I also love having it in a tube.  If you have shiny objects that you want shinier, this is an outstanding metal polish!I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.",1368316800,2013-05-12

The transmission always seemed to have a faint howl to it that I assumed was normal. It was also not very smooth in gear changes especially when it was cold out (slight grinding even if you waited after pushing in the clutch to change gears).Today I changed out the old stuff for this MT90 and all I can say is it made an INSTANT difference. The transmission is buttery smooth shifting in every gear and it was cold out today (12/31/2011). And that howl I assumed was normal and part of my 102K is completely gone.

And, it won't actually power much, very effectively, anyway.  Despite the seemingly high watt rating, it (still) doesn't really have enough power for a lot of things (before just overloading and turning itself off), and most of the things it will power it causes to buzz, due presumably, to the ""modified sin wave"" power.  I'm not a big fan of the beeping noise it makes, supposedly at 11.8 volts.  The batteries have really just started draining by the time mine goes into its obnoxious making racket mode.

5.0,"I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience.",1403395200,2014-06-22

And they're compatible with the RainX washer fluid to boot (won't turn orange or degrade).I had to knock off a star because every set of these for me will chatter and wiggle near the edges on occasion. It's because the blade isn't rigid enough. RainX needs to improve the design to increase lateral rigidity so that this doesn't happen. Out of the box, the rainx isn't as good as a regular blade.

5.0,I like the fact that the cord is very long.  I haven't actually figured out where to mount it yet but for now I just hook it up to the SAE connector which the previous owner spliced into the headlight power feed.

5.0,Finally we have weather that permits using these towels for their stated purpose and I only wish I had these the last time I cranked up the hose and water contraptions.  The size of each towel (12 altogether) at first blush was too big but once I started I could not have been pleased more.  More soapy water meets the metal faster and therefore making for a speedy application.  I used another towel for the rinse cycle (sounds like a washing machine to me) and that was the right combination so far.  Then to finish the job I used a barely damp third towel to wipe off the water spots.  That sound in the background is the drum roll for the finished job and it's a beauty.  I firmly support not using any cleaning product but those that are professionally suggested and by no means would I ever use fabric softener with the towels.  Upon completion of the job I put the three of them in the dog sink for a through hand washing and they are air drying and look fantastic.  I had never thought of it before using a fairly large towel especially since I normally used a towel or rag about the size of a large wash cloth but the larger towel like these is so much better because the weight of the water in the towel makes removing dirt so much easier.  Great product with many more uses than cleaning a vehicle.  Watch out garage doors and all that other flat surface.  You dirt is short lived thanks to Doctor Joe.,1299974400,2011-03-13

2.0,"I'm a car guy who used to own a custom detail shop and who has his cars detailed regularly.  So, I'm going to be a harsh critic of this type of product.This is not a kit that you would keep in your glovebox for quick clean-ups.  In fact, it doesn't even include any cloths.  This is really just a trial pack with 2oz of five of their products, probably intended to get you to buy larger quantities.The products are:""All Purpose"" spray""Window Clear"" spray""Dashboard Protect"" spray""Carpet + Upholstery"" spray""Leather Care"" creamThey all worked OK (not great), but they are also all scented. Some are lemon-orange scented.  Others are lavender scented.  All smell pretty bad, in my opinion.  If I walked out of my detail shop after paying a few hundred bucks, and my car smelled like this, I would not be happy.My only real concern was the leather care - it seems to be very oily and not really like leatherique, saddle soap or other products I use.This stuff might be OK for 90% of people driving around in ordinary cars, but if you are someone who really pays attention to car detailing - you actually own an orbital polisher - this is probably not for you.",1308700800,2011-06-22

It worked fine for brushing off the windshield, with a little leaning and reaching for me to get the center.  I'm short and I drive a big Jeep.

4.0,"My husband is a professional maintenance/painter/remodeling person and was very interested in testing out this sander.  Although it tends to lean more toward the car end of things, he managed to make it work fine for wall sanding, doors, and some fine sanding jobs that he found to test it on.  He worked a little on his van with it and I will update as he uses it on his van more with input.The sand paper wears down really fast (but he was not surprised by that), and in order to use this with the shop vac, he found that it had to be modified a bit.  The cone thing had to be put into the vacuum in a different way because it did not work as it was supposed to with the hose or set up.  The paper included in this unit seem to lean more toward auto work, by the way.As for longevity, he said that it is fine for doing with light sanding jobs, but for bigger jobs, it would be better to get something more solidly constructed.  He said that it was okay and decent for small jobs, but would not recommend it for doing an entire house or a large amount of automotive work. He felt that it was a bit too flimsy for that.All in all he rated this four stars and after watching him use this and assemble it, I would have to agree.

3.0,"Quick Summary Review:I have both the Zubie and the Automatic, tested on a 2001 Olds Alero using an iPhone 5 with iOS7Pros for Zubie:The Battery Health Feature is good, and there are more car diagnostics.  This device isn&#8217;t Bluetooth dependent.It knows what the car is doing even when the cell phone isn&#8217;t there.  That&#8217;s nice for teenage drivers, or for checking on my car when parked in airport long-term parkingWith automatic, the app has to be on in the background, and the device will connect to the first user it sees.  If I go on a trip with my wife, Automatic might think that she is driving instead of meYou can share driver scores and car data with a group, which is useful for parents with teens.  My kids aren&#8217;t driving age for a couple of years, but when they turn 16 I&#8217;ll be looking for a product that supports this.Pros for Automatic:Both cost about the same up front, but the Zubie has a $99.99 annual service contract (because it uses the cell towers).  Because Automatic uses the cell phone for all transmissions, you only have to pay once.  Big PlusThe Automatic App is easier to navigateWith Zubie, the car is assigned to a driver.  All trips on the car will go to the assigned driver, regardless of who is actually driving the car.  You must actively change the active driver for the car, which is actually pretty easy to do, but easy to mess up.  There is no way to &#8220;fix&#8221; who the actual driver was after the fact.Crash Alert.  The device will alert pre-defined contacts and even an Automatic agent in case a crash is detected.Gas Prices.  It shows an estimated gas spent based on average fuel prices in the area.  Right now this functionality is limited, because it assumes a grade of gas and can&#8217;t be customized to what I actually paid for it.  It would be great if it knew I used 87 octane gas, when I fueled up, and what the price was at that station.It has audible feedback when you hard brake, hard accelerate, or exceed a speed.  These can be turned on or off, but can&#8217;t be tuned.  For example, Colorado has posted 75 speed limits, so exceeding a fixed 70MPH threshold isn&#8217;t valuable.Car location tracking:  This should be a pro for Zubie, I&#8217;m paying $99.99/year almost precisely for this reason.  However, time-after-time Zubie thinks my car is a block away (at a neighbors house) when it is clearly parked in my garage.  My cell phones are all properly detected in my house, but yet Zubie thinks my car is a block away.  That makes car location tracking useless!  Automatic knows where my car is, as long as I have my phone with me (which I always do)Both the same:Both products have limited functionality on a 2001 Alero.  My car just doesn&#8217;t send all of the signals that a new car does (i.e. Fuel Gage Level, MPG)Neither product has a good web interface, where you can set up your account, view metrics/data, etc&#8230;Conclusion:If I didn&#8217;t have smart phones for my family that I was already paying $150/month for, I&#8217;d be more positive for the Zubie.  That being said, I do have smart phones.  My smartphones and Automatic combined can do 95% of what Zubie and Zubie App can do (Car Location Tracking, Family Tracking, Driving Stats, Engine Health), and it can do several things that Zubie can&#8217;t (audible feedback, crash alert).  The 2 things that Zubie can do that Automatic can&#8217;t, only Battery Health is desirable. The other (tracking without a cell phone) is unnecessary for me.Since I have 2 cars, I&#8217;d end up paying $200/year (vs $200 once) to use Zubie.  That&#8217;s too much money for what is currently offered.  They need to find a way to either reduce the cost, or offer a 2-tiered product for those who don&#8217;t have a cell phone.  They state numerous times that they don&#8217;t make money off of the cell service, so they should find a way to eliminate it (or make it optional).Detailed Experience ReviewThe quick-start instructions were easy to follow.  First, I downloaded the app to the phone.  When I first opened the app, I was asked to create an account.  I was given the option to log-in from Facebook, which made the log in easy.  I was then prompted to create groups, which allow shared features.  I set up mine for my family.I then followed the instructions to activate the Zubie Key.  I liked that it used barcode scanning to detect the Zubie Key and Activation code.  It took about a minute to get my phone angled correctly to detect the 2-d barcode, but it worked.  It even detected by VIN barcode for my car, however I received an email about 10 minutes later saying by VIN barcode was invalid so I had to manually enter it.My family can be in my group without the app, but the value is more limited.  It does detect their location (like Find My Friends).  You can turn off location tracking within the app permanently (switch) or temporarily (up to 2 days).  Since I am using this with my family, I will leave the location tracking on (we have nothing to hide!).I took the car for a drive around the block, and when I came back home I looked at the stats.  For some reason, my car is shown parked a block away from my house (not anywhere near where I was driving).  This happens a lot.  I don&#8217;t have a lot of confidence in being able to find my car, when it says my car is 1-2 blocks away from reality.  Big minus.I&#8217;ve gone on several more drives, and I must say that the phone user interface needs some work.  Some of the features you need to &#8220;pull up&#8221; from the bottom,  which is nearly the same gesture on iOS7 to pull up the utility screen.  It is very frustrating to distinguish between the two gestures correctly.  Big minus.",1395187200,2014-03-19

4.0,"The Black and Decker Electromate 400 is one of the must have devices in your home / car / garage in the event of power failures and for roadside emergency car repairs.This all-in-one device is much less expensive than the sum of its parts bought individually and far more attractive and portable.Before you start using this device please read the instructions provided, the instructions say to fully charge the battery for 40 hours or more to make sure it fills to maximum capacity. Lead acid batteries don't like to be fully discharged.Inverter function:The ""400"" in the name indicates that the inverter is cable of peak bursts of 400W power draw, but in practice you should probably only be using this to power devices in the sub 50 watt range Please do not Plug-in an air conditioner or a toaster and expect it to work. This is not designed to run such high power drain appliances.AC inverters such as these are not 100% efficient so if you are running appliances off the inverter built into this unit; expect a useable capacity more like 150 watts when the battery is fully charged.My personal experience is that you can run a fully charged Electromate 400 inverter with 4 CFL Bulbs (13W each) for about 2 hrs and 45 mins before the inverter shuts off. At this stage, the battery voltage is well below the 11.2vDC to about 10VDC when the inverter just quits working to prevent battery damage.*** TIP ***Use the accessory plugs for 12v more often than the inverter, you draw power directly from the battery which is smarter way to use the device than using the inverter.For example, if you wish to charge your cell phone first attempt to use the car accessories supplied with your cell phone if available rather than using the Electromate 400's inverter and using 120V power adapter.Jump Starting and Air Compressor function:The car starting and air compressor functionality come in handy surprisingly more often than you think especially if you own an older car. These simple functions found in Electromate 400 can be lifesavers.It has plenty of power to jumpstart a 4cyl or may be certain 6cyl cars but do not expect to start a v8 or bigger car using this. The Cold Cranking amps needed to jumpstart bigger car is just too much to ask from a 19Ah sealed lead acid battery which is rated to be at 228 watts at best .The Air compressor is only good for keeping your tires to PSI levels recommended by your car manufacturer; do not expect to use this to completely inflate a 100% flat tire. The compressor is noisy and will shutdown to save itself from getting overheated. It can however be used to inflate bicycle tires and inflate mattress without much issues.Area light function:It is a neat idea but  falls short of my expectations, Especially when you have been using Electromate 400`s inverter function for about 2 hrs or more and battery voltage drops to about 11.0v the Area light fails to glow! while the inverter still keeps working!I fail to understand why limit the area light's LED power draw? This is the least power consuming part of the unit and I was expecting this would stay illuminated till the battery completely dies (Perfect use in emergency situation)It was strange to see that Inverter's fan keeps spinning under low battery condition but area light stops working - Go figure!PROS:[+]  Very well built, compact and can take good amount of abuse[+]  All-in-one device is much less expensive than the sum of its parts bought individually.CONS:[-]  Area light LEDs stops working even if battery has enough juice to run the inverter and cooling fanStill well worth the money as this all-in-one device is much less expensive than the sum of its parts bought individually and far more attractive and portable.",1241568000,2009-05-06

Yes... but it sure does impress when in use.You'd think it was a magnet the way it holds on to items placed on it, really sticky but with no residue on items or fingers, just sticky rubber mat.It works, and that is saying something these days.Note that any item placed on the mat that is round or cylindrical COULD still roll if it's heavy enough and you go around a corner hard enough.

I generally like to use Delphi and other modern weather proof connectors but sometimes those are overkill in both price and complexity.

I would imagine that if you were to plug and unplug these often they would loosen up in time making them easier to fully seat and unplug.

3.0,"ProsMostly straight forward driving monitoring deviceEasy to install thanks to the OBD port lookup in the android appCell-based data transfer so no need to remember to connect via bluetooth on your phone and sends alerts in real-timeConsInherent privacy issuesConfusing appFeels like a beta device for the consumer during both the set up stage and anytime when looking on their website for support articlesPossibly drains the battery of the car far faster than it should (left my car parked for 3 days and received notification the battery was low)Final verdictLimited functionality, $99 yearly fee, and privacy issues make the Zubie Key a niche item that the target audience, concerned parents of teen drivers, will truly appreciate.All the RestPrivacy: There is already a heated debate about the privacy issues surrounding this item so for that I would refer anyone to the privacy policy and the comments on so many of the other reviews.Set up: Initial set up went smoothly enough although due to the dumbed-down approach they use there is little to tell you that while the initial set up happens on the first drive, the vehicle is not actually added until the next day or later.During set up it allows use of a smartphone camera to scan the serial number and activation code to set up the device, but i could not get it to scan the vin (tried both the dash plate and the # and barcode on the registration card)Once everything was set up the operation was mostly seamless, the app tracked my journey, showed on a map where I was accelerating rapidly or braking hard, how long i idled, and my top speed. The app itself was confusing to use as some of the information would be under a subheading in the menu that was not immediately apparent, ie old trips seem to have disappeared after a day or two but could be found by going through 3 menus, after two days of not driving that particular car (the key is still installed) the app has forgotten that I have a car set up, although I did find an engine and battery alert notification that when selected show no information.Just to test the tracking abilities I went to a private lot in the snow and spun the car around, when i checked the app later that day it did not show any alerts related to that so presumably your teenage drivers could still be getting away with hooligan behavior and you would never be notified.The battery in my car is not all that old and has never had any issues so i was quite surprised that after about a week of being plugged into my car (the last 3 days I did not drive it) Zubie notified me that the battery was getting low. I had previously seen that other reviews mention similar things, hopefully this will be addressed in an update soon.Finally I found that on my particular car (1999 Mazda Miata) the diagnostic port that the Zubie app so helpfully located for me was just underneath and to the left of the steering wheel, but due to the size of the key i had to remove and store the diagnostics port cover which is also the fuse block cover.",1393113600,2014-02-23

5.0,"This is an excellent solar battery charger for those situations where power is not readily available or inconvenient. It is well made and high quality. It is also the latest solar cell technology where it does not require clear sunlight but can charge even on cloudy days. It can also handle bright sunlight and hot Summer days along with rain. It is weatherproof and rust resistant. Overall one of the better solar battery chargers. There are some things to consider when using this solar battery charger. It only outputs 5 watts which is about 410ma or 1/2 amp DC and that is a on a sunny day. So don't expect this solar charger to restore a run down or drained battery, it does not provide enough power. It will be good for those vehicles/boats/atvs that have on-board computers (like engine computers) or other electronics that draw a current from the battery even when shutoff. Our boat draws about 50-100ma even when shutoff and if you don't use it or charge it for a week or two then the battery will get low. This solar charger is a great way to handle that discharge and then you don't have to worry about a leaving your boat/etc for a long period unattended. With small batteries (like with ATVs, motorcycles and similar) you might have to worry about overcharging although not likely since this solar charger only works during the daytime. Overall an excellent and quality solar battery charger that can be very useful.",1364515200,2013-03-29

3.0,I've purchased the AutoTex wipers 3 previous times for my wife's van and my truck.  The wipers do an excellent job at clearing the windshield during the warmer months but don't seem to last long (haven't found a brand that does) especially in colder weather.  I typically get about 6-8 months use out of them but the last set I got didn't last that long.  One of the blades had and end cap fall off and the plastic latch that secures the blade to the arm kept popping up.

2.0,"I purchased a set of these for my 2013 Subie Outback...(26"" Driver & 19"" Passenger even though Amazon fitment said it wouldn't fit) and they fit perfectly. I've read all the reviews about the wipers not making contact with the center of the windshield but as far as my Outback goes they make full contact all the way across and are very quiet. I just got home (literally an hour ago) after driving in severe weather consisting of a mixture of ice, sleet and snow and I'm very happy with the performance. I'm not sure how long they will last but I hope to get at least a winter season out of them. In my opinion these blades might be better suited for windshields that are designed with very little curvature. I also have a 2001 Chevy Malibu and on many occasions over the years I've had to be very selective when purchasing blades because  of the inward curve of the windshield. So why only 4 stars?, don't know how long they will last. If I get a full season out of then I'll update my score.UPDATE 6/28/2013: I had to remove these wipers from my Subaru outback after a few months because they started making lots of noise while in the rain. I tried cleaning the blades multiple times and nothing worked. They continued to clean effectively but the contact noise was not tolerable. They are also slightly shorter than OEM and it was causing my Onboard Collision Avoidance System (Eyesight) to disable during rain because it would not clear lens area effectively. I re-installed the OEM wipers and all is well. From now on I'll stick to Subaru OEM wipers.",1360281600,2013-02-08

Either way, it's still very convenient as you can dry a whole car in just a few minutes.The one issue I have is that the towel snags on pointy edges (grill, emblems, tail lights, door handles, etc). This causes minor tears in the fabric. It's still working fine for me after maybe 10 washes, but it probably won't last as long as it should because of the constant tearing.Pro tip: Remember, this thing is BIG, so ensure you don't let the towel touch the ground when you're drying the lower areas of your car.",1374451200,2013-07-22

If it happens though, it is easily removed by wiping with a good polishing cloth. Meguiar's Wash and Wax is also not really a good substitute for an occasional real waxing. It is good to extend the period of time in between waxings.""Meguiar's Wash and Wax"" cleans well, and its hybrid blend of waxes offers a little bit of extra protection.

5.0,"The best thing about the ACDelco Clear Vision Wiper Blade is the way it works, no spots, no streaks, just a perfectly clear windshield. I got one to replace a wiper, and it works so well I'm getting one for the other side. Another great feature of this wiper is it comes with adaptors to fit all wiper arms. I don't know if the wiper arms on my car are hook lock, side lock, pin lock or whatever. But with the ACDelco Clear Vision Wiper Blade I don't need to know, because whatever it is the adaptor to fit my car comes with it. Simple. Also these blades come with a wear indicator to let me know when they need to be replaced, and since I never change my wiper blades until it's long over due, I'm anxious to see how that works. All and all a great wiper.",1358640000,2013-01-20

4.0,"If someone told me last year that I could wash my SUV with a 24 oz bottle of stuff and not have to do anything else I would have probably broken a rib laughing.  To make it even funnier I would have had great difficulty in thinking that any would be left over.  Alas, I waited for a rainy, bleak day with few good reasons to do anything outside.  Out came a bottle of Eco Touch and a few micro rags (I sure wish they had been included in the package).  I was having a hard time thinking that Eco would work.  A spray and a wipe and in about an hour I had a sparkling Tahoe that looked as if it had just come out of the professional car wash joint.  I had enough left over to do it all again.  The package said I could expect at least 3 or 4 washes; however, a Tahoe has a few more square inches than a normal car.  (Is there such a thing now as a ""normal car?"")  The best part is not having to worry about all the water that I normally waste.  Living on a well and trying to wash vehicles is not a good pairing.  Then I did not have to rewind the hose and on and on.  You know the routine.  That's over.  It is now pull our the bottle and the rags and in a reasonable time you have a clean vehicle.  Wow!",1258329600,2009-11-16
5.0,"I like this garden hose nozzle because it does a lot and saves water.  The nozzle has 7 settings and they do everything except allow 10 gallons/minute in which case I can take the nozzle off if desired.The nozzle seems sturdy, not like the cheap plastic ones I've seen and actually purchased in the past.  I had been using a steel nozzle that doesn't conserve water.  I believe this nozzle will take care of my needs including high pressure spraying.  Sample provided for review.",1395187200,2014-03-19

4.0,"Krud Kutter has worked much better for me than standard surface cleaners, with its added detergent, and has an unoffensive smell.  Most products in this category are too toxic to use for many purposes, but Krud Kutter is safe to use on household surfaces, or even clothing, in addition to the bigger jobs like auto parts.  I have used it for cleaning off latex paint, soap scum, and mildew.  For all of these jobs, it worked better than my standard cleaners, but it still took some elbow grease.I was sent this bottle for review, but I plan to buy more.  The only caveat I would give is that you may want something harsher if you plan to go at heavy duty tasks and don't mind working with corrosive chemicals.  What they lack is subtlety, they make up for in power.",1350604800,2012-10-19
5.0,I like this 3M Tire Restorer because it goes on easily and covers well. It leaves the tire looking great and not real shiny but like new. I don't like the really shiny tire products because it looks peculiar to see a tire that way. I prefer the matte finish where the tire looks like new and clean. I have tried lots of tire products and use this one consistently on my new truck and looks great. Also seems to last awhile. I also like the way it comes out of the spray bottle as it is a nice fan spray that covers a good area. Worth trying if you like to keep your vehicle looking like new.,1357344000,2013-01-05

Some oil filters are a bit small for this wrench, but it works really well on medium sized oil filters. Before the ownership of this oil filter wrench, i had so many cases where the oil filter literally just melted shut onto the thread. When i was young, i knew no better, so i would take a screw driver and stab it through one side then to the other and use the screwdriver for increase of torque! hahaha It was tough... a bit funny, and really really messy. but now i never have to deal with that again.

5.0,"Having read the glowing reviews of this product here on Amazon, I went ahead and purchased a bottle of Zymol Z507 Leather Cleaner and went right to work on the well worn leather of my car with beige leather interior. The results were simply terrific.Using a white color micro-fiber towel and just a little bit of rubbing, years of ground in dirt and grime came up in mere moments. With each successive application, that white towel got dirtier and dirtier while the seat upholstery emerged fresh, clean and rejuvenated. After the third time 'round, I was done.The leather looked like new again and was smooth, supple and not least, smelled great. Notably, it did not darken the leather, which some famous brands are known to do.This is a fabulous product that delivers excellent results with minimum effort. It is head and shoulders above other leather cleaners -- cleaners that require an enormous amount of ""elbow grease"" to yield lesser results.I wholeheartedly recommend Zymol for leather. Try it ... you'll be delighted!Ps. The conditioner is just as good!",1231632000,2009-01-11
5.0,The open tube of other brands has a short pot life. I buy this one because I get to use the whole tube no matter how long it takes.The tube also is stronger and you don't end up with a handful of stuff coming out where it is not supposed to.I buy this brand in quantity as I know that down the road when I open a new tube the stuff will be the same as the one I just finished.,1398556800,2014-04-27
4.0,"I've been using various types of self-adhering silicone tape for various household tasks.  They work great in some applications; not so well in others.  I have yet to achieve a leak-free garden hose repair.  Dirt on the hose and some that inevitably gets between the tape layers stops it from sealing properly...even if it's sealed at first, the water eventually seems to work it's way through as the hose is flexed.  On the other hand, I've used it to attach a shop-vac hose to my miter saw and it works perfectly to hold everything together.The big advantage of the 3M version is that it's translucent.  Unlike the other silicone tape that I've purchased from Amazon, the underlying color shows through.  Otherwise, it seems to be pretty much the same as the other versions.",1393027200,2014-02-22

2.0,"Amazon sent me a previously-returned ARB inflator and, not surprisingly, its hose leaked.  It was leaking from where the silver hose connected to the silver body.  I returned the ARB and bought a Milton Dual Chuck Tire Inflator With Gauge which uses higher-quality materials and higher-quality construction, though the ARB has a few advantages in design.The ARB has a gauge that's easier to read than Milton's.  The only problem is that the chuck on the ARB's air hose doesn't rotate like on the Milton, so you may need to clip the ARB's hose onto the air connector at an angle that makes the ARB's gauge hard to read.The Milton's chuck is open on both sides of the tilted silver end which I've read means you can push the Milton's hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.  Apparently this is necessary on certain vehicles and equipment.  If you don't need that feature, then the ARB's clip-on connector is probably more convenient.  The clip itself feels a little weak and might break over time, though if it did you could hold it against the air connector.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect.The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.",1354060800,2012-11-28

5.0,"I bought these to replace a bulb physically broken during disassembly for an unrelated project.  My headlights and fog lights had previously been converted to HID's and we've always enjoyed their performance.  With bulbs coming in all difference price ranges you wonder what makes one better than the other.  The ones I've seen 'appear' to have identical build quality despite wide price differences and these were no exception.Be careful when selecting the bulb to ensure you get the right one, but once they arrive the connectors should match what you already have, but perhaps there will be an extra/unneeded piece of a wire loom you'll need to remove, or a rubber boot which will need to be carefully cut away before installation.The higher the temperature of the bulb (8000k vs. 6000k vs. 6000k) the more the color tint of the light will change.  The temperature which best matches stock/legal color would be 5000-6000k, a more whitish light.  These at 8000k have a slight violet/bluish tint.",1337385600,2012-05-19

1.0,"I've been with Amazon since they were just selling books and I've been reading reviews for a very long time. In fact, I've read enough reviews over the years to become suspicious of the validity of some if warranted. That said, I am highly suspicious of many of the five star ratings this device is receiving and it gives me pause.That said, I received this device not completely knowing what I was getting. There are several devices out there that do the same thing without a subscription ($99 a year? Are you kidding me?) and without the privacy issues this device seems to be famous for. I carefully read all their online documentation. Some folks may care less about privacy and that's fine. I'm not overly concerned about it myself but after reading their documentation there's no way I'm signing on for this or paying them $99 for their service.If you don't mind them tracking you and storing all your information, and you don't mind paying them $99 a year to do that, and you don't mind who else receives that information, then go ahead and jump in.

Not only does it light up the tag but it lights up the entire rear of the bike switch is an added safety feature for night riding.

4.0,"This is a very good LED Light Bar that works very well. I installed it on my 2007 Dodge Ram 1500, just above my bumper so it isn't very visible in day light until it come on. The lights are bright even in the day, and very bright at night, adding more safety to my truck. My only complaint is with the instruction sheet, which indicates to install the light with the wires on the right side as in the picture. I installed it like indicated and plugged it into my trailer wiring plug. When I tested the lights the turn signal activated the wrong side, so I had to remove the light bar and reinstall it in the opposite direction. The good thing was I had installed it using the included brackets instead of the double sided tape. I highly recommend you plug it in to test it BEFORE you install it to your vehicle, especially if you plan to use the double sided tape.

Paint adheres well (proper surface prep is always required.)  My only reservation with it is that you must apply all the coats that may be required within 1 hour.  After that, you need to wait a week before re-coating.  I found that there was no option to sand between coats if sanding looked to be necessary.  It takes well over an hour before this paint can be sanded, then a week (per the instructions) needs to elapse before you can apply more coats.  I had this situation in two small areas.  Admittedly, I could have done a better preparation for painting, but it was still a pain to wait a week to complete the work.With proper prep, this is a good paint, and great color match for the Ariens.

Secondly, the two backing plates that come standard with it are worthless, throw them away!  Plan on purchasing a Meguiars or a 3M backing plate to pair with this polisher.  I went with Meguiars W68 backing plate but the W66 would be an equally good choice.

4.0,"First off, let me start by saying that this is a very high quality product. I've purchased several items from Rugged Ridge for my 11' Jeep Wrangler Unlimited:Side stepsTrailer hitch mountTail light brush protectorsetc.This item is just as high quality as the rest of those. However there is one major functional issue that I think the manufacturer overlooked - You need a way to ground this mount to the vehicle so that you can lower the SWR of your CB setup without damaging your CB equipment. If you're using this for an off-road flag mount or to mount a 'no ground plane' antenna then its perfect. However if like most people you're going to mount a CB antenna which requires a good ground plane, then you're going to have to make some modifications to be able to ground this.Basically what I did was take a hammer and chisel and scrape off the powder coating down to the metal around the left hole. I then used that hole to mount another stud which connects to a grounding strap. Then on the underside of the right hold (where your coax cable ground shield will touch) I scraped the powder coating off of there down to the bare metal as well. Then I was able to run my ground strap from the left hole through my tailgate and onto the metal surface of my Jeep.I tried this setup the first time without doing that and my SWR was around 2.5 - 3.5 depending on the channel, I could not get it any better. After doing this my SWR is between a 1.0 (perfect) and 1.2 on all channels.My setup is:FireStik II antenna (tunable tip)FireStik mount studFireStik 18' coax cableFireStik SS-3H HD springMy stock spare tire (255 75R17) is also slightly contacting the antenna which may be an issue. I plan to purchase the FireStik quick disconnect which will raise the antenna a few inches and hopefully reduce the contact. The contact is not doing anything to impact my SWR, however it could potentially damage the antenna at some point. Also with it touching the tire, the spring isn't going to do much if you hit something over-head head-on, because the antenna can only flex back so much. I wish Rugged Ridge had done a little additional R&D; before they rolled this item out due to that and the issue with grounding.",1359504000,2013-01-30
5.0,"I have the 5 watt and 2.5 watt versions of this solar panel, and I have to give them full marks for being easy to use, well-made, and put together nicely as a kit.The NOCO solar panels are sold as ""Battery Maintainers"" and that is their most obvious use, but they don't have to be just for keeping engine batteries topped up. I have half dozen batteries I use with my various solar panels (old car batteries, deep-cycle batteries). I charge them up, then bring them in to my RV to attach to my inverters, and run appliances and electronics from them that way.These panels come with battery clamp connectors, so I just attach them to my batteries outside in the sun. I have a multimeter to tell me when a battery is fully charged and ready to go. Since I don't need to run anything directly from the solar panel, and I use electricity sparingly, I don't need bigger panels. I just give them the time they need to do their thing. It's more crucial that I have a large enough wattage on my power inverter, actually.With these being as low-watt as they are, you don't need to buy/hook up an additional charge controller. That makes these basically plug and go panels, which is nice if you are new to using solar power and don't want to drop a lot of money experimenting with it. You still need an have an inverter for AC power uses, however.PERSONAL SOLAR NOTESAltogether, I have a 15-watt solar panel, two five watt panels, the 2.5 watt panel and a 1 watt mini-panel (from different companies). I also have an assortment of stand-alone solar gadgets. I have four deep cycle batteries I am always charging up with a panel attached, and rotate things around. I have several inverters to hook different things up to.If you live in a sort of camping/RV/low income situation, like I do most of the time, this really is enough to get by with. I can use my entertainment devices, lights, low watt cooking appliances, fans for air and a small personal space heater, and that's all my needs right there.RECOMMENDATIONObviously, for the typical person living in a home with all the luxuries, this isn't going to be enough of a solar system to run a household. We are only talking 2.5 or 5 watts in either panel. However, for people living an extreme frugal lifestyle, or living out of their car or an RV, these panels are nice to have around.More to the point for most people, these little panels could be lifesaving if an emergency situation hits your area. You could pull out your car/boat/lawn mower battery and charge it up if you had to, and - using an inverter or a DC appliance - get power. You could charge your phone and make a call out, or connect to the internet. You could charge your Kindle and the kids could have days of reading time available. You could hook up a lamp and have light.And they do keep a car battery topped up nicely with the included cigarette lighter (12-volt plug) connector.  :)",1367884800,2013-05-07

5.0,"I purchased these headlights to replace the aging ones in my 89 LeSabre. I had a pair of similar Sylvania's in my 89 Oldsmobile, and I really liked them, so I thought that I would give these a try because they were only $20 instead of $60 for the Sylvania's. These are just as bright I think, but they don't have as blue of a tint as the Sylvania's, but that doesn't matter to me. I just like them because they are brighter and whiter than traditional halogen's and they are really great in the fog.There is just one thing about these lights. Because of the gas used to power them, they will not last as long as regular halogens because these are a lot brighter. On average, these will last about a year, maybe two with depending how much you use them.Overall, I would highly recommend these to someone looking for replacement headlights.",1373673600,2013-07-13

3.0,"This is a good air compressor in terms of how well it performs and the specs, etc however I was disappointed that it does not come with a carrying case like some other models by Viair.  Considering this is one of the more expensive models, it should come with that, which is way better than just storing the product box in your vehicle.I opted to purchase this bag to put the compressor in and it fits well, but I hate that I had to spend more money on something that should be included:G.I. Style O.D. Mechanics Tool BagThe fact that this connects directly to your vehicle battery is a plus. I've had other air compressors in the past that used the cigarette lighter however they can burn your fuse quickly. With a model that connects to the battery directly, there is no chance of burning out a fuse in your vehicle. Be sure to start up the engine before using this so you don't drain your battery though.for my usage, I probably could have gotten by with a much cheaper and lower powered Black and Decker model which plugs into the cigarette lighter without a problem. It would take longer and not be as enjoyable to use however would have saved me some hard-earned money.Another negative is that the battery jumpers on this are really small; they don't even fit over my entire battery terminals. The tiny clamps should be much bigger.If you use a Viair model that has a lighter plug on it in conjunction with this adapterRoadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter Adapter, you will find that the battery jumpers are bigger and can clamp on to the battery much better.",1358899200,2013-01-23

5.0,"Living in Florida means rusty tools and since we invest a lot in various tools, blades, japanese wood saws/knives and much more...this looked like a very useful product. Plain and simple, the oil just doesn't do the job given the ultra high humidity of Florida especially during summer. We literally can get 90 to 99 percent humidity on hot summer afternoons right before the rain.In any case, I suspect that nothing short of total climate control will totally eradicate the problem but for those living in places with normal levels of humidity this should perform fairly well and is much more convenient than using oil after every use.Bottom line - given the cost versus convenience, I'd be inclined to use this product for higher priced tools, coin collections and other valuables but wish it provided an extended coverage period and/or larger size for big items.",1251676800,2009-08-31
2.0,"This is a very versatile system.  It can save a ton of work.  It is durable and solidly made.  It works as advertised, BUT: after a few uses, the unit started spraying used motor oil out of the top of the T-handle. What a mess! Used, black oil everyplace.  I called Mityvac and asked if there was some sort of replacement seal kit.  They promptly replaced the entire unit at their expense.  Great customer service, I was truly impressed.  Soon thereafter, the new unit started leaking just like the previous one.  Used oil everyplace! I was given no warning about synthetic oils when I called Mityvac (if this thing is incompatible with synthetic oils and fluids such as transmission, then I can't see what value it has).I own several vehicles and need a product which doesn't fail after 5 uses.  I did not contact Mityvac a second time as my warranty expired, rather have decided that the product may have a design flaw or unknown limitation.

5.0,"I like the light from these lamps.  I made sure to install with rubber gloves to prolong life, so I'll see if I can get a good year out of them at least.  Given the fact that a set of these cost me less than the price of one standard OEM replacement bulb from the parts department of my dealer, it's not like I'm spending a fortune if I replace them yearly.  Besides, the much better illumination makes it even more worth it.  Although they won't be mistaken for HID lights, they are definitely whiter and brighter than standard halogen bulbs.  It gives off a nice natural looking white and most importantly, bright light.  I like the increased visibility it provides my wife's mini-van.  I feel a bit safer when she's driving at night with the kids.  That was my primary reason for buying these, not as an HID wanna-be.  If you're buying these for a Xenon or HID look, save your money or buy an HID conversion kit instead.  My car has factory HID and side by side, they look nothing alike, not even close.  However, these perform well against HIDs and aren't exactly a slouch.  They actually even illuminate wider laterally than my lamps. I originally thought about installing an HID conversion kit on the van, but after researching online for a few weeks and reading numerous stories about problems ranging from water intrusion to bad ballasts or bulbs, I decided to stick with standard yet brighter bulbs.  They may not be as ""pretty"" as HID lamps but they seem just as bright.",1330905600,2012-03-05

5.0,"rain season is coming so I was thinking of replacing the wiper blades on my cars--Honda Odyssey and Honda Civic.The locking mechanism is so easy to replace it's incredible.Basically the Honda cars come with the same wiper locking adapters where you use your nail to clip open the top locking lid.Then pull the blade portion down (to unhook the main wiper arm from it's U-shape hook).Then it basically just slides out very easily.I didn't see a 26"" version even though that's what's on my cars (both) (22"" and 26"").I took the 28"" version and to my amaze, it fit as well.  It's an inch longer on both ends and it doesn't extrude over the windshield glass section or hitting the border.The wiper makes a very clean sweep and very low noise level.It's aerodynamic enough where it doesn't create extra wind noise (compared to your stock ones).The wipers are light weight and curves just perfectly to cover the entire sweeping path/area.Highly recommended.",1283212800,2010-08-31
5.0,"OK, I'm a light nut. I fabricate my own LED light painting tools, room lights - even friends ask me to create lights for their daughter's doll houses. I have spools of LED lights on hand, and every part to make them work. So why exactly would I order this? As I said, I'm a light nut and I'm curious.  I swear that there are only a couple of factories in the world churning out parts for LED's.  The controller, remote, connectors - these are the same generic ones I have in my parts bins.  So why pay a premium price for this kit? 1) You have a warranty and it ships from the USA. 2) No soldering (and those four tabs are mighty close!), 3) it's ready to go.All the connectors are already soldered in place, you have all the wires and parts you'll need. No guessing n voltage, connectors, compatibility and the like.  Plus the LED strips are black, not white, so they blend in.  If you've ever used self-adhesive LED strips, you know the adhesive is questionable. It works great or it falls off. The LED strips included in this kit use 3M VHB tape. VHB has been voted one of the top 20 inventions of the past 10 years. The stuff bonds to almost anything and stays in place. This is the only LED strip I've seen to use VHB. VHB does take some pressure to adhere, and it increases it's bond over 72 hours. The surface has to be clean, free of waxes and grease, and dry.You can plug this right in to any car outlet. I still call them lighter sockets.  Now, these LED's run on 12 volts.  So if you're handy, you can cut the cable from the car adapter and wire it up directly.  The controller module also contains the sensor for the remote control, and this needs to be line of sight to the remote.  You have about 6 inches of wire to play with, so you can hide the controller and just leave the wire exposed.  The controller attaches with a screw or two sided tape (a square of tape is included). There's also a small strip of two sided tape included.  These are not VHB tape. You'll also need a way to secure the wires. 3M makes some command hooks in clear plastic designed for small wires.  Alternately, if the LED's are out of sight, you can just tie-wrap everything in place (but you'll still need a way to secure the end of the wire with the remote sensor.)You can install this in as little as 30 minutes, or, if you want to hide everything, an hour or so.",1397952000,2014-04-20

5.0,"I bought a pair of these to use while pulling a 17' Bowrider type boat behind a 2007 Ford Ranger.  With just the stock mirrors, any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me.  With the mirrors, that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially: one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone.  When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove, the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all.  Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely.  Also, the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them.  Well, there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror.  If I had somebody to move it for me, I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver's seat.  As it is, I had to get out, adjust the mirror, get back in, check the adjustment from the driver's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right.  I don't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them.

4.0,"I have tried many car shampoos including Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash, NXT Car Wash, and some from the professional Mirror Glaze Line of Meguiar's washes such as Hi Tech Wash.Among those products, Gold Class was always my favorite for its solid cleaning ability, but also its ability to leave a final shine and maintain the previous layer of wax on the car.I purchased Ultimate Wash and Wax and got my two wash buckets with Grit Guards ready!I used a fair amount of the product to ensure I had plenty of suds and so that I would be sure to receive any of the wax/protection benefits if indeed they existed.The smell of Ultimate Wash and Wax is lovely.  Furthermore, it looks unlike any wash product I have ever used.  It is rather opaque and thick, so there must be something special and different about the product as Meguiar's suggests.The cleaning ability was solid, if only the slightest bit weaker than Gold Class.  The suds were great, and it was a pleasure working with the pleasant smelling product.I dried the car thoroughly.  The result?  The car was clean and had a subdued sparkle to it.  However, the paint was not very slick and there was not much shine.  Certainly, even using a Quick Detailer leaves more shine afterwards than Ultimate Wash and Wax.  Therefore, I felt the need to follow up Ultimate Wash and Wax with Ultimate Quick Wax.  This restored the shine and slickness to my vehicle, but also questions the legitimacy of using a wash with theoretical protection benefits, if you still need to follow with a wax product.In conclusion, Ultimate Wash & Wax is another fine product from Meguiar's.  It's a pleasure to use and wash your vehicle with, and there are no significant negatives to using the product.  Perhaps others will find the product leaves more protection/wax than I found in my trial.However, like many wash and wax products, the protection provided by any car shampoo/wash seems to be almost non existent.  The wash and wax products usually have a higher price tag, so many will find it more price effective to simply get Meguiar's Gold Class wash and follow it with a Quick Wax for touch up maintenance, or a regular wax for full protection, if you have not waxed in a while.However, for those wanting to try something new or hold onto the hope that there might be some small protection left by a car wash after all, Ultimate Wash and Wax is another solid product from the folks at Meguiar's!",1277769600,2010-06-29
3.0,"The other reviewers that mentioned this stuff applied like paint weren't kidding. The instructions indicate that each body panel will take at least 1 can of the 3M defender. It sprays out just like a clearcoat paint and initially looks milky/cloudy with an orange peel texture, sort of like frosted glass. After a few hours, it starts to dry out and become more clear. However, it will never be optically clear and tends to have a translucent appearance. Unfortunately, once it dries out it is very difficult to remove completely. I used a light to medium coat on my headlights and on a small part of the glass on my house door. It was nearly impossible to remove from my house door, but once I scraped off a small section I could see how moisture could get trapped behind it and require re-application.Overall: 3/5 stars, it is definitely not an easy &#34;DIY&#34; way of applying a clear bra on the car. In fact, I have the clear protective film sheets for headlights and I would prefer those over the 3M spray system.",1392768000,2014-02-19
5.0,"This is a must have item for any pickup truck!  Face it, today's pickup trucks have heavy tailgates.  Trucks are being used by everyone in the family too.  My wife has trouble opening the tailgate when running to Lowes or Homedepot.  It's too heavy for her.  So I got on the net and did some research and found the DeeZee Tailgate Assist.  Hands down this is the best 30 bucks I've spent on my pickup.  It is worth every single cent!!!  Now my tailgate on my 2013 Supercrew opens with 1 finger and slowly opens wide nice and gentle.  Installation is pretty straight forward.  The directions and illustrations are accurate.  The kit even includes the right sized torx (star bit) wrench!  It does need a 13mm wrench but a small/med crescent wrench will do just fine.  No issues with the unit pinching or crimping the support cables.  They must have done a redesign because this device does not relocate your support cable at all.  It just requires you to remove it inorder to put a flat piece that mounts the assist piston.  Then you re-secure the OEM cable support mount back on the truck.  Nothing changes in relation to how or the location of the OEM cable supports. It is incredibly easy to install on the 2013 F150 Supercrew.  It took me longer to walk to the beer fridge and get a fresh cold one.I don't plan on buying another pickup anytime soon.  But if I do, this item will be the first thing I get for any new truck I buy.  Yes... it really is that great.",1365811200,2013-04-13
5.0,"I use to change my oil every 3,000 miles so the Jiffy lube filters were fine. Now that my SUV has 80,000 miles and does not get the use it use to, I decided to go 5,000 miles between changes and that could mean my oil will be in the engine for almost a year between changes. I switched to synthetic oil and did a bunch of research on oil filters. This one with the Filtech media kept appearing at the top of everyones list. As usual Amazon did its part on price and delivery. The filter seems solid and fits well. Not much more to say from this end. I did the research and for the money this filter ranks at the top of the list.One last thing. My 2005 Lexus uses the same filter and I had one in my cart ready to purchase in the near future.

This charger has a split leads design with one pair with traditional spring clamp ends. The other set of ends has eyes that can be bolted under the battery post clamp nuts on each post. This way you can install those eye ends on the car battery and then quickly attach the charger leads when you need to charge. nice design touch. It says it's designed in the USA but unfortunately it's manufactured in China. I would have happily spent a bit more to keep our guys in jobs in the USA, but I couldn't find an AGM charger made here.

4.0,"I have been using a Battery Tender Junior for about 5 years on my motorcycle.  I always plug in the bike and it works great.I recently purchased the Battery Tender Plus to use on my Duramax truck (2 batteries).  It seems to work great so far.  I expect long life of the unit and the batteries just as I have in the past using this line of Battery Tenders.I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the short length of cable they give you.  The Junior's cables are so long that I can run that thing clear across the room.  The Plus' cables are so short that I had to splice in more cable.  They apparently don't expect you to charge your batteries in-vehicle with the Plus.By the way, the Plus brings my 2 very large batteries in my truck upto full charge in less than 8 hours.  They are new batteries and the truck's charging system works just fine and the truck is even driven almost everyday.  However, there is alot of parasitic draw on the batteries with the remote start / alarm system on overnite.  Combined with the 100 plus degree heat of the desert, the Battery Tender Plus is warranted.Of course I would not expect it to recharge my truck batteries if they were dead.  It is not designed to.  Make sure you look at the specs and know what you need.  I just needed a battery tender - something that would keep my batteries at full charge or restore the bit of charge lost overnite from the parasitic draw of the car alarm / starter.  By spec, the Battery Tender Plus cannot recharge these large batteries from dead.  Again, know what you need.  The tech folks at Deltran can help you with that.",1290816000,2010-11-27

4.0,"I bought the Castrol Transmax Import in the case and didn't realize that within the case was a bag and a pull out drain spout.  I purchased this because the lowest cost per quart price.  I like the product, I use it in my Honda and Toyota vehicles.  It is more work for me to use in this form but it was my mistake, I will pay a bit more next time, either a gallon container or regular quart size.  For now, I am filling a quart bottle from this and transferring the quart bottle one at a time to my transmissions.UDPATE 10/26/13: Just a little update about my experience with the 6 gallon box size.  As I stated above, I have been transferring to a Castrol Transmax quart and filling my transmission in my cars.  One thing I noticed is because the Castrol quart contaniners are black AND the Transmax is red, it is very hard to see the level as I fill in the quart container.  Compared to standard engine oil quarts which one can easily see on the side of the container where the level of oil is in the container, I need a strong light from above so I can peak into the Castrol quart containers.  Not a big deal except for an occassional overfilling, but just a FYI for others who are planning on ordering the box size.My future plan is to maybe continue buying this box if it still nets me the lowest $/quart and then use a funnel and clean gallon container, like milk or vinegar container to transfer.  Mark lines for different quart levels on the container.  This will give me the best of both worlds, best quart value AND easy and clean transfers.I also looked into what I paid back on 5/13 and for everyone's reference, it was $101 ($4.20 per quart).Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",1368316800,2013-05-12

Of the 8 screws I attempted to remove, 7 stripped the heads and 1 actually had backed itself out before I even got to it.  I ended up cracking the plastic off of them in order to get them out.

3.0,"I got one of these for my wife's Taurus, which has a pretty rounded back window that causes some 'missed' spots at the ends of the blades of standard flat wiper blades. These wiper blades are naturally rounded and contact the glass along the entire edge. I was able to use one size larger, increasing visibility while still making full contact with the glass.The one thing I really don't like is the connection when the the wiper blade is mounted to the wiper arm on the car. The package includes a whole range of options to choose from, covering nearly any make or model car, but the connection point is WAY too big. Normally, the arm of the wiper fits inside of the wiper blade frame, providing a thin profile. These blades have plastic clips that attach to the wiper arm, and then attach to a base on the wiper blade itself. This makes the connection point for a wiper arm to the blade twice as thick as my old wiper blade (1"" compared to 1/2""). Along the entire length of the blade, the profile is kept very simple and thin, but once you get to the wiper arm connection, it's much taller then the rest of the blade. Despite the fact that the AC Delco blade is only a little bit taller then my old blade, the design makes it look a LOT taller. After replacing the rear wiper on my wife's car (without her knowledge), she walked by and the wiper blade 'knuckle' immediately caught her attention and she questioned me about it. She was surprised to find that it wasn't too much taller then her last blade as she too was fooled by the odd profile of the wiper blade.I ended up buying a different brand of blades for my wife's front wipers (Trico). These were much slimmer and shorter, and seemed easier to install, but they didn't include nearly as many connector pieces, so likely wouldn't be as universal as these blades. If they made these connectors so large in order to accommodate a larger variety of vehicles, I'd simply say that it wasn't worth it.Overall, I like the fact that the wiper blade does a good job contacting the glass, and the blade works well and is streak-free, however the size of the connecting piece is, in my opinion, unnecessarily large. If you have a vehicle that you normally have trouble finding a wiper blade to fit, I'd recommend giving these a shot. Otherwise, I'd have to give these blades a few months to determine if the longevity makes it all worth it because I personally just don't like the appearance.",1358035200,2013-01-13

5.0,"About 22 years ago I encountered my first synthetic fabric drying cloth.  It was so effective, I bought another one for the other surfaced that needed drying.  Speed forward into the current century and AmazonBasics introduced its version of a Drying Chamois that is every bit as good or even better when price is introduced into the mixture.I was showing one of these to a friend and he said they are real skin and refused to listen to my argument that they are synthetic cloth made to act and look like the real thing.  It took his looking through a 10X loupe to see the threads running through the fabric to agree with me.  The point is these chamois are working better than the real thing from my standpoint and after using both, I would not revert to the old ways.They maintain moisture for quite some time and are ready to go to work right out of the container.  And they work on almost any wet surface.  I use one for the dogs when they get wet while outside and finish them off with the microfiber wet collector.  Vehicles and glass come clean and dry in little time, plus it is easier just to drag the chamois across the surface and permit the slight left over water to dry naturally.This  product is truly one of those that &#34;every home needs at least two&#34; of them.",1398556800,2014-04-27
5.0,THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN.  GOOD PRODUCT.,1403654400,2014-06-25
5.0,"Extremely accurate, ergonomic, does not have the external pointer stop to bend the pointer, and it is easy to read.  It does not hold pressure after the gauge is removed; the button on the side is for bleeding off pressure only. Purchase the rubber Moroso 89590 Tire Pressure Gauge Cover that is made for it, the protection and improved handling make it well worth the money and it looks much better with the cover on.When buying a tool it is best to get a good one that will last for years.  The research I did on the internet paid off, I am totally satisfied with this gauge.  Because it is a new style it can take a few times to get used to using it.  I recommend putting your index finger under the nozzle to make sure the gauge goes on straight to avoid unwanted leaking and apply pressure with your thumb, after using it a while this is may not be necessary.Being a mechanic I check my tire pressures on both vehicles once a week and accuracy and ease of use is very important to me. I keep this gauge inside the house to keep it nice and my old gauges in the vehicles.According to Moroso, each Moroso 89560 gauge is individually calibrated for accuracy within 2% which means that at 50 psi the gauge should be not lower than 49 or above 51 as it will not be off by more than 1 psi.The Moroso 89562 Pro Series Tire Pressure Gauge which is accurate within one half percent which means that the Pro gauge would be not lower than 49.75 or above 50.25 at 50 psi as it will not be off by more than one fourth psi.I had my Moroso 89560 gauge tested on digital calibration equipment and it was as accurate as the Pro is advertised to be through the range of 5 to 60. If you have a tire that loses more than 1 or 2 psi a month you can have a nail or other leak and several times I have found leaks by regular checks when one tire was lower than the other three.With high gas prices, keeping your tires properly inflated helps to get the best gas mileage, and twice I have been driving along and have seen people with low tires have blowouts which you can help to avoid by catching slow leaks early.The gauge is a great value and Amazon.com helped me to get the best price on a product I am totally satisfied with.  The one gauge I currently have developed a bent pointer from the zero external stop, the Moroso does not have the zero stop (it does have one where the 75 would be) and I wanted a nice gauge that would last and be easy to use so I am totally delighted and completely satisfied with the Moroso.",1208390400,2008-04-17

It comes with two pads, one to wash and one to use.  It also comes with a little bottle to fill with water.  This is so much better than using window cleaner and paper towels.The wand is long enough for me to reach every nook and cranny.  The head swivels as I wipe.  I use a scrubbing motion.

5.0,"I almost bought one of the cheaper all-plastic triangles until I read the reviews about how easily those are blown down by light wind from traffic.Thanks to the sand-filled plastic base, this unit weighs over 3 lbs, and feels sturdy enough to stand up to wind from nearby traffic. The package says it's rated for 40mph winds and meets DOT standards.As you can see in the product pictures, half of the triangle surface is a red reflector material and the other half is bright orange fluorescent colored  plastic for visibility both at night and during the day. Both sides are reflectorized for visibility in both directions (and so you don't have to pay attention to which way you deploy it).It's pretty easy to snap together and deploy, but as another reviewer said, it's a good idea to set it up at least once before you need it in an emergency to see how it's done.Definitely a good thing to keep in the car in case of emergency.",1321056000,2011-11-12

4.0,"I got this to maintain the battery on my C63 Mercedes which I (unfortunately) am currently unable to drive and which is just idling under the covered parking next to the house, for months at a time. I connected it directly to ""jump start"" terminals under the hood (the actual battery is in the trunk under the mat - not a very convenient area to access), plugged it into wall outlet on the exterior of our house (the 220V ""utility"" outlet - this device supports it), routed the cable, closed the hood. The indicator light was glowing ""yellow"" (meaning it was charging) and then turned solid ""green"" after a few hours (the charging current of this particular model is small so the process is pretty slow), and I just left it connected after that.Overall I am very satisfied with this unit - it is pretty compact, very inexpensive (especially compared to ridiculously overpriced Mercedes-rebadged CTEK chargers/maintainers), waterproof (I already tested, we had thunderstorm a couple of days ago), fully automatic unit with a good warranty. The only couple of minor drawbacks I can see are that the included cable (the one with alligator clips) is a little bit short (though there's an extension available for extra money, which I already purchased) and that there's no carrying case included. But these are pretty subjective drawbacks and I still highly recommend this unit if you are looking for a truly universal (except for maintaining Li-based batteries), durable battery maintainer. And if you need a unit with higher charging current for faster charging - there are also plenty of these available from same manufacturer.",1404950400,2014-07-10

I also tried to diagnose the ABS fault on my 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee -- it can talk to the engine sub-system but not the ABS sub-system.

5.0,"Bluemagic Metal Polish Cream 7 ozBluemagic metal polish cream is essentially Brasso dyed blue with more abrasive content. It contains ammonia and will react with aluminum and stainless steel by developing a black oxide layer that is buffed off. It also creates a noxious gas as a result of this reaction, so I highly recommend wearing a respirator or working in a well ventilated area.The Bluemagic will not fix scratches or pitting. It will give brushed stainless a shinier luster, and it will rejuvenate polished stainless steel surfaces and chromed surfaces. I bought it mainly for my exhaust pipe tips on my cars and motorcycle. On one particular car, which has a direct injection turbocharged engine, the tips will become coated with a thick layer of soot within a few minutes of driving. This is a common problem with direct injected engines. Look at any Audi car made within the last 10 years and their exhaust tips will be coated with black soot. This is not the result of using 93 octane fuel, but rather a combustion byproduct of a direct injected engine.More and more vehicle OEMs are switching to direct fuel injection for better fuel economy, more horsepower, and better fuel metering. This means we get better engine performance, but the exhaust tips start to look nasty after a few miles. This is where Bluemagic comes in. I was able to get rid of some of the soot using regular polishing compound. However, Bluemagic got rid of all the hard soot deposits. Unfortunately, it couldn't do anything for the pitted surfaces. But it was able to get the chromed mirror-like surfaces looking better than new.On my other car, the tips just looked a little worse for wear but the mirror polished T304 tips were still in good shape. The Bluemagic shined it right up. On my motorcycle, the Termignoni tips are just brushed stainless steel but the Bluemagic made it shinier and brighter.I would recommend wearing gloves, as the Stoddard solvent smell will dig into your fingers. The black oxide residue also gets everywhere on your hands and buffing rags, so a well-ventilated workspace is mandatory.I would also recommend keeping that foam gasket in place when you remove the cap. Just lift it halfway and tear the clear seal. The gasket will help prevent it from drying out.Overall: 5/5 stars, very inexpensive solution to dirty exhaust tips and metal surfaces.",1331251200,2012-03-09

As others mentioned it does break easy.Even though it breaks easy and it would be nice if it was tuffer built,it still saves me alot of pain so here I am looking for another one. I feel I got lucky getting two yrs out of it as easy as it broke. I'll give it another shot and I'll be more careful using it. If your looking into buying one of these this review shouldnt stop you from purchasing one. These are not junk by any means. The head will not break under normal use. Just dont force it out if it gets stuck like mine did.As far as the head coming loose as some state here mine stayed tight after screwed in.

3.0,"I recently purchased several cell phone mounts that work in my car's cd player but was thinking that the visor idea was not bad so gave this a try.  It's probably the best option for anyone out there that actually uses their cd player or in a car that may not have one, but in general, the phone is set on the backend of the visor so makes it awkward to try to actually touch any of the buttons.  This shouldn't be a problem if you're using a blue tooth headset, but if you're one that likes to interact with it for GPS or anything else, it's an awkward reach.  The good news is that it fits just about any size phone be it small or large including Smartphones such as the Samsung Galazy, Iphone, ad Blackberry.  It would also accomodate old tiny phones such as the motorola razor.  The grip is firm and adjusting it is extremely easy.The final comparison is that if you have this plugged into the car charger, the cord is now hanging from your visor which is not ideal.

5.0,"Good product holds down my outdoor patio rug.  Be sure to have something on hand to pull them back up as they lay very flat and the disks are recessed to prevent the nail heads from being trip hazards. Through trail and error I've found it best to not drive the nails tightly flat against the disks, leaving just a small gap that allows me to grip the heads with pliers when I'm ready to pull them back out.

See the other reviews for the wiring pinout instructions, and thanks a million to earlier reviewers that posted that info. You should ideally have a workshop manual for your vehicle and take some time to determine which wires you should tap into for the lock/unlock/power/ground/lights. Four stars because of sparse documentation, but this system is incomprehensible value. $15 for the entire system, including two heavy, really nice key fobs?? After the dust settled, my system works from about 300' away.

4.0,"I am not a sophisticated mechanic, but I am handy at fixing some things.  And one thing I have learned is to never take my car for service before first checking it with a scanner.  I have saved many hundreds of dollars getting fixit tips from the internet based on what my scanner told me.  And, by taking good care of my car and truck, I get lots of mileage from them - they are all at least 15 years old.My previous scanner was very basic and gave basic codes on two short lines of a very small display.  So this Innova scanner is a real treat to use.  And for all it does, it is really simple to use.  I have no DTC codes to read at the moment but connecting, scanning and navigating the menus was very simple.  I really like the system status indicator for emissions testing readiness.  The live data reading and capture is also easy to use.  I just hope it is a while before I need to use the fix assist feature.There are some things I didn't like about the scanner including the lengthy installation (complete with a reboot) on my Windows 7 laptop.  Also, the instructions that come with the scanner also do not mention how to install the software - there is no included disc.  One line directing to plug the scanner into the PC and letting the PC detect it would have been helpful.  I also had to enter my 1996 Ford and my 1998 Chrysler info manually (perhaps they were too old to auto detect?).  Finally, this model does not come with the ABS and airbag coverage for either of the autos I tested.  For the price, I think they should have included that option.",1369958400,2013-05-31

I followed the instructions and sprayed the solution on a Microfiber towel and cleaned the back tailgate.  I could see the dirt come off on the yellow towel.  It took a little bit of effort to completely remove the product with a fresh towel.  I am not sure if I want to do an entire vehicle with a waterless cleaner.

4.0,"Mounted on a hand drill, Chemical Guys ACC-201 medium duty brush, with medium stiff, yellow, 0.9"" high bristles, is very good tool for general cleaning.  The bristles are firmly seated into the hard plastic circular base, and won't easily be dislodged by pressure being applied to the brush.  The medium stiff polypropylene bristles will bend, rather than break, so it should work reasonably well on most carpets.  If you have a reversible drill, you might want to change directions periodically, to avoid having the bristles bent over too far to one side.The shaft is hexagonal, to provide a secure grip in the drill chuck, and provide a good amount of torque.  You can apply a good amount of pressure to this brush, which makes it very good for harder surfaces like sink, tile, granite, wood panels, and concrete.  Scratching shouldn't be an issue on these harder surfaces, but you should exercise care on softer materials.  The bristles aren't metal, so they will wear down, but under normal use, this brush should have a decent usable life.There are some more expensive drill mounted brushes, which makes the Chemical Guys brush a good value buy.  The price fluctuates, so if you do a lot of cleaning, you might want stock up when the price dips.",1384128000,2013-11-11

They have a good strong cast wire and plug assembly (as pictured) and they used a very good quality wire of what looks to be at least an 18 ga wire, with good flexibility.  The alligator clips use a high quality end and should give a good long service life if not abused.  With a 3 foot lead length I assume they are designed mostly for use as a bench test lead set, but these will service any use where a 3 foot length will do the job.

4.0,"The unit is slightly larger than I envisioned (about 10"" x 10"") and seems to be of decent build quality. Despite the claim, I'm not sure how well it will stand up to years in the sun. The accessories (cables) are of better quality than I expected.It can be easily mounted with screws, the included suction cups (such as to a car window), or just propped up against something. It has an 8 foot cord to allow placement of the cell away from your battery. It comes with a set of clamp-on connectors (like jumper cables) and a connector for charging through a cigarette-lighter-style 12V port.On a clear and sunny February afternoon, I hooked up a voltmeter to the output and it is generating the peak rated 22V at 150 milliamps.If you are unfamiliar with these devices, they are not meant to power your devices directly, you use this to charge the battery that feeds your devices. I use it to charge a 12V tractor-mower size battery that I use to power camping gear (lanterns, DVD players).4 stars for build quality and utility, with a bonus star for its bargain price. 5 stars.UPDATE: taking it down a star since the build quality wasn't quite as high as I had hoped.

5.0,"I've been a regular user of Permatex silicone spray for over ten years.  I use the spray mostly as preservative for rubber, plastics, and other synthetic materials, and as a lubricant for things like lock mechanisms, zippers, screws, and joints.  I apply it to the rubber hoses and sealing strips in my car, my bicycle tires, running shoes, nylon cases and luggage, and even camera gear.  Silicone is also a good electrical conductor.  After cleaning electrical contacts, I apply a little spray, which seems to improve performance and deters corrosion.Unlike CRC's silicone spray which can react with and deface and damage certain plastics, Permatex's silicone spray has never damaged anything that I have used it on.  The spray comes with a tiny plastic tube that you can insert into the spray nozzle, so that the spray can be concentrated and applied in a confined area, like the key slot in a lock.  The only real gripe I have is that the product has a tendency to foams up when sprayed, and this is exacerbated when the tube is attached.  The resulting ""spray"" is usually really messy, and hard to apply evenly.  Other than this, I have no major complaints about the product, which has apparently been in production for over 90 years.Silicone spray is flammable, but not exceedingly so.  Still care should be exercised in its use, and adequate ventilation should be provided.  The Permatex spray can holds 10.25 ounces, which is more than theCRC 05074 CRC product.  The Permatex spray costs about $4.50 at my local store, so you might want to check around for the best price.",1341964800,2012-07-11

I've tried many different types of glass cleaners from the age old Windex, to spray foam cleaners, paste cleaners, and finally this one.  This one is horrible.  While initially the cleaner seems to work, it leaves behind a thin oily residue on the glass.  In more than 30 years of detailing and taking care of cars I've never encountered a product that hazes/fogs faster than or more than this one does. To make sure I tested the product on all kinds of glass from auto glass to windows in the home, mirrors, aquariums, etc. and even tried using different drying tools from several types of paper towels, microfiber towels, synthetic chamois, and the results were always the same...it fogged/hazed on all the types of glass in a very short time.Do not waste your money on this cleaner.

I've been using them on my truck since I got it in 2008 and I think the paint looks as good as it does today because of that despite the harsh Texas summers which last about 6 months around here.To use the refresher you need to leave your vehicle running, with the AC on, for 15 minutes. That's not a big deal but you do need to be where your car is secure and/or under close observation.The new car scent is not bad but not fantastic either (to me). It is strong the first day or two after application then it is just a very pleasant clean smell. I used mine about 40 days ago and it still smells fresh when I open the door after it has been sitting. I smoke in my truck so that is impressive. I use a water bottle that I can reseal with a little water in it for the butts to keep the old ashtray smell at bay.The instructions mention a locking mechanism.

I think it actually pulled the fingerprint off the lens.  I've got an old flip phone that isn't in the best shape and it actually stuck so good that it almost pulled the batter cover off.

5.0,"These are the greatest thing since sliced bread if you want your car to dry spotless.  I live in a coastal area with very hard water.  It is essential that water not be allowed to just air dry on your car.  Before, I was using oversized bath towels to wipe down my car and was having to constantly wring the water out.  With this, all you need is a small towel to finish the job and I don't ever have to wring it out.  The squeegee gets 95% of the water without marking up your paint.If there is any negative to this, it's that it doesn't do well on rounded body parts.  It does its best work on the broad panels of sheet metal and glass.  But that's OK.  That's why I use a small towel to finish the job off.",1405814400,2014-07-20
4.0,"I normally use the smaller recharge kit (white bottle) but since i ran out, I bought this spray and the bigger oil can to match. I used it on a k&n filter I had never cleaned and unlike the other white bottle cleaner, it did not completely remove the oil, so it is hard to say I'm 100% satisfied. I will need to test it on the other filter which I have cleaned before to see if it was just this filter. Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be, but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it won't be for a while. Since i don't see any other alternatives I imagine this is the only option for regular (non synthetic) k&n filter cleaner, if you can get your hands on the white bottle cleaner that works great and I can vouch for that. In this case the problem could be the filter, I have bought a few of the white recharge kits so I know how to clean filters. Time will tell",1360281600,2013-02-08

My RV has a pretty clunky means of getting our freshwater hose into the water bay--essentially a removable floor pan that has a corner cut out for the hose.  So you remove the floor pan, route your hose, then replace the floor pan with the corner cut-out allowing the hose to pass through.  The trouble with that is that any bends or movement in the hose results in the floor pan lifting out of place.  I wanted something more secure to keep critters out of my water bay, so I'm using this.  I will mount it to a new floor and then screw that floor down permanently.

5.0,The K&N HP oil filters are the model of K&N with the 1&#34; nut on the end so that you don't need an oil filter wrench. If you're a DIY person you will appreciate being able to tighten/loosen this in a small space  where it is very hard to get a standard oil filter wrench of any kind. All you need is a 1&#34; wrench. This particular size fits my Miata and the filter is squeezed into a tiny engine cavity where access is very limited. This filter is a breeze to install or remove from above the car. The K&N brand is made by the same company that makes Mobil1 oil filters and that is as good as it gets. I highly recommend this filter for Miata owners and I recommend K&N HP (with the nut) and PS (without the nut) for all vehicles. The quality is excellent and Amazon has the best prices.,1378339200,2013-09-05

3.0,"Accutire MS-5550 is perfect to fit in the trunk of a car/van for those times when an air compressor is needed.  It has the standard adaptors for sports balls, air mattress inflatables etc, and the standard locking valve stem connector.  This works well on bikes and the inflatables.  Car tires take more time to inflate or get up to pressure.  Power for this little compressor comes from the 12 volt outlet in the car/van.  There is good length on the power cord and depending where the 12 volt outlet is on your vehicle it will reach to the car's tires.  Light weight and easy to use make this ideal for carrying around.  The problem with this is that on flat surfaces the compressor doesn't stand still when started.  It will walk around. Gauges are small and hard to read and there didn't seem to be a light for night time reading.  This is basically something to add to the traveling safety kit or to have on hand for those emergency bike tire inflating times.  Made of plastic that feels cheap.  I'm betting this would not take much of a drop to break.  With so many better compressors out on the market today, I can only moderately recommend this one.  It will work but there are better ones, Black & Decker comes to mind, and not for that much more money.",1371859200,2013-06-22

5.0,"I did a lot of research on battery jump units with built-in air compressors and this one seems to be one of the best because the nozzle on the tire inflator is metal, not some weak plastic that is prone to breakage. Also, the over-all build quality of this unit is top notch and professional quality including the coiled air hose and the jumper cables as well. While this was a bit more expensive than I was initially wanting to spend, I think it's worth the money in the long run as you are paying a bit more for something of higher quality.I hate having to use the car to power a tire inflator because I drive a hybrid and doing so just takes from the hybrid battery, thereby decreasing mileage a bit. Also, with the type that you plug into the cigarette lighter, you can run the risk of burning out a fuse fairly easily.It's nice not to have to start the car or even unlock it to check and pump up the tires. And, I have a nice battery jump starter in case I ever need it since the car does sometimes sit for long periods of time.I also like that this has no vampire draw when plugged in. So, after it is done charging, it draws zero watts-you may keep it plugged in all the time if you want to without fear of wasting electricity.Note that this unit is definitely heavy and is too heavy to keep in the car with you all the time (in my opinion), so I also purchased an inexpensive and small/light tire inflator to keep in the trunk for emergencies -Slime COMP02 12-Volt Tire Inflator.",1380672000,2013-10-02

4.0,"The INNOVA 3320 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeter is a good meter, especially for the price. It's well made, and has features usually found in more expensive meters. Batteries are included which is good. Having to remove screws and take the meter apart to replace them, not so much. The test leads are OK. The rubber holders on the meter do a very poor job of holding them when not in use, but it's not a big deal. There is no case of any kind included. The meter seems fairly accurate. The Auto-Ranging can take a few seconds to stabilize, and there is no manual override. Overall this is a very good meter for use around the home, or the ""garage mechanic"". Professional mechanics will probably want buy a meter that costs more than $20 though. The INNOVA 3320 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeter is a great value, and I recommend it.",1389657600,2014-01-14

5.0,"I spent nearly 30 days researching inverter type generators for use when camping with our trailer.  Product reviews and forum feedback kept pointing to both Honda and Yamaha.  Since our generator needs are for dry camping, the main objective was for charging our batteries (2) and ability to power the 1100 watt microwave, and of course, early morning coffee!My final decision was the Yamaha EF2000iS 2000 watt inverter generator.  It is pleasantly quiet, especially in the eco-mode.  It runs at idle and responds immediately to power demand.  It powers the microwave with ease.  However, it will not power up the 11,500btu AC.  This is not a negative for us because you can't run a genny continuously at a campground anyway. It is light enough to carry with one hand and easy enough to pull start that a child could pull the starter cord.You can purchase this generator with confidence.

5.0,"I absolutley love Amazon!!!  For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a ""jump"" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The ""booster car"" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a ""dead"" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the ""dead"" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!  They are inexpensive and top notch quality!",1292889600,2010-12-21

If the link doesn't work google (32886-led-interior-light-kit-install-2013-pilot-lots-pix). Basically have a skinny butter knife or thin flat head screwdriver. It is super easy to pop off the light covers. Make sure to align correctly on map light and rear window light. Those have directionality apparently so if it doesn't work in one direction, pop out and flip around.[...]- LED is whiter than the yellowish OEM lights- LED is brighter by a noticeable amtI'm very pleased with the purchase. for $11, it is a no-brainer. I'm actually keeping the middle and backseat OEM lights as I like to watch the kids while I drive at night. I worry the LEDs will be too bright initially.Will update if things change... but for now highly recommend.",1397347200,2014-04-13
5.0,We've always been a fan of Meguiar's products & this is just as impressive.  These were to replace several drying towels that were well past their prime & much smaller.  I believe that size does matter...when it comes to being able to dry much larger areas with less effort.  The waffle design seems to dry much quicker that the flat towels.,1402963200,2014-06-17
1.0,"I chose these sprayers for their chemical resistance. I used this acid wheel cleaner in it, which works very well for cleaning wheels. Since it's slightly acidic, I wanted a robust sprayer. This sprayer worked the first time, but when I tried to use it a week later, it was completely clogged. What a piece of crap for this price point.",1389052800,2014-01-07
5.0,"Haven't used it yet; although, I looked it over.  I got it partly because it's a cute little thing.  Fits in my car nicely.  Basically I took the recommendations of the other reviewers.

5.0,"We own a 35 foot travel trailer by Forrest River, a Rockwood Signature Elite. We bought a set of these RV Stabilizer to cut down on the swaying when you walk across the trailer. We had no idea if they would reduce the swaying on our trailer, so we took a chance on them and they worked. We have two slides in the rear of our trailer so we installed one under each slide under each frame of the trailer. This has reduce 90% of the sway we had when we walked across the trailer. We are thinking about getting another set for our front, we have one slide in the front. These stabilizers won't reduce it a 100% of the swaying but they come close. I would recommend these to anyone.",1375574400,2013-08-04
5.0,"ive used this on many cars, since the tool was first sold. I Love it.No it don't work on all cars.(no scan on earth tool does !!!!) but all 96+ cars it does.it works on my C.A.N buss 04 grand vitara. and my 96 Mazda and  and 99 Mazdaand 2 Geo trackers (sidekicks)  96/97 and others,  vast numbers..if your car is older than that?, then it don't comply to obd2 standards.?then it has no chance of working!!! (same with other makers of 0bd2 tools!!)there are exceptions,some 94 Fords,have OBD2 and scans perfectly.some 94 Toyota's toolTruth of it:it don't work, until the unit has it's battery good, and is plugged in to carand the key is turn on ,, in the car, with no communications, it can't work.  sorry, but that is a fact.  The 2 chips end to end need power to work and talk.before condemning it, try 2 cars, 96+  (it fill work )1996 and newer....it only reads EPA codes, P0xxx and never, factory codes P1,(unless lucky)mine reads P17xx factory tranny codes. (nicely but not on all cars)P0xx DTC codes and PIDS, are federal codes,  (basic to all cars here) 96+it's a federal rules scanner ONLY, you will never see a tool that gets all carsand all factory codes, no P1xxx  or p2xxxx. for cheap. $5000 yes.with a box full of plugin for $300 each.  but not for $50ever,, go to  [i cant post other linkings so search OBD2 tools....]it does not do ABS either. sorry.  (it does have lots of bang for the buck)you do not need windows 7 for it to work, in fact,the tool works all by itself.it has a nice graphic mode.  unlike! any other tool! for this price.!for that, i give it 100 points.  (im ASE and have 5 tools of many  brands)since it reads all the federal PIDS/DTCS only, it dont need to be updatedafter all that has been the same for 17 long years, unchanged.updates?, what a wild idea.?the doc.s are weak but what do you expect for $50 from china.I love mine.i plug it , scan and it done,, i use mine alot in graphic mode.the 02 sensors,or MAF,or MAP.  excels at that for low pricethe guy who posted, it shows 2 Dtc'S BUT LISTS, 1Reasons.1:on Fed code and 1 hidden factory code.2: code P0400 which is 2 codes, 400a and b, see pending for a or b.3: its intermittent.  (marginal failure. so use pendings to see them)the scans are long.so by the end,, maybe the DTC cleared but for the next scan.do be too critical, just trust the DTCs shorted, or pending.EFI is not digital nor  is the engine,it is analog.things can fail and clear fast.  its you job to be patient and watch.eg:lets say the idle switch is on the hairy edge. so the code comes and goesrandomly with engine shaking it.... see?some ECUs are slow to scan than others. the tool can not correct that.no tool can.happy scanning.",1357257600,2013-01-04
5.0,I purchased this item for dusting on my Harley. It easily gets into hard to reach areas to keep them dust free. I also have used it for dusting in my automobile where it works well. I would recommend this product to all my friends. I do own the full sized California Duster for exterior dusting and the full size interior duster. They all work perfectly.,1404086400,2014-06-30
5.0,I bought this product much because of the reviews and am glad I did.  You get 12 different combs all in two pieces with an easily attachable handle.  The handle is just a nut and washer that can be tightened by hand.  You don't even really need to put the handle on if you don't want to.  It's simple and easy.  I like it.,1341273600,2012-07-03

2.0,"I was really looking forward to putting this on my truck.  You have to apply it in 'warmer' weather (65+ if I recall) so make sure to plan accordingly.In the end, there's a LOT to do to try to get this right.  I didn't get it 'right' the first time, but was able to reset.  Likewise, a kit doesn't cover much.  It's basically good for a front bra, but you'd need quite a few to, say, cover the hood.There's also a ton of prep work, but that's kind of to be expected.I probably won't use this again.  It does work, but it's such a pain that I'd rather just take it to a shop, pay a bit more to have someone else do it, and have a bit more confidence in the application.I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.",1391644800,2014-02-06
5.0,"Fantastic! This little inverter fits right in the cup holders of my Jeep Cherokee and actually gives me 180 watts in a modified sinewave form. It comes with a cigarette outlet socket, and also battery clamps for direct battery attachment.There is one AC output plug, and four USB plugs. I haven't needed to attach five devices at once, but so far it's had no problem with three (my iPhone, laptop and ASUS tablet). As long as all electronics fall within 180 watts of power draw, it works very smoothly.I spend a lot of time living in my Jeep, car camping out on the road, and already use this inverter more than my array of other ones. It's more convenient, is quieter, and stays put in the cup holder.Energizer has been branching out lately with all kinds of new gear for cars, camping and survival. I like this trend. Highly recommended little inverter that packs a wallop.",1371945600,2013-06-23

5.0,"These are much nicer than expected. Heavy duty, clean look, and the hood does not move at all now. I installed them on a 2014 Wrangler - fit no problems at all.  Great productInstall tip for the lower bolt - I used a smaller 3/8 ratchet and placed it in the body gap and put a regular (not deep well) socket on after putting the ratchet in. This worked well and greatly reduced my time on the second latch. Top bolts are simple. They were easy to adjust. Also, you have to remove one of the Allen shanks when installing - I put a little locktite on when reassembling for peace of mind. First time you open them don't let them drop on your color matched fenders as I did. No scratch, but after a few times I am sure it would scratch.Agree with the other reviewer that Jeep should put these on stock. This is my first Jeep and I was a more than a little surprised how much the hood came up on a drive from LA to Phx on the freeway.",1391212800,2014-02-01
5.0,Bought it for  my car but so far it is delegated to drying my 10 pound mini Doberman.  The pup has several recurved teeth and you have to be fast in getting the water on the soap on the rinse done and the biggie the dog must be dry before leaving the controlled wet area.These mitts give you 4 surfaces that are more that adequate for my dog.  The trick is getting them on at the end of rinse. so you might consider a dog wash stand as sold by Amazon that keeps the dog from jumping to the floor and breaking something if the floor is not carpeted.  Two people would be nice so you can play bad cop and good cop thereby avoiding the putting the mitt on which is not easy in this situation.  My dog is like a rocket and has only two states wild and sleeping.,1405209600,2014-07-13

5.0,I used a single kit on the headlights of my 1998 Chrysler Town and Country and my 1996 Ford F150.  The result for both vehicles was amazing.  The polishing sequence of the pads in the kit transformed my lenses from so opaque the bulbs weren't visible to nearly new looking.  The increased nighttime visibility was truly impressive. I would not hesitate to use this product again.  I can't imagine a better DIY solution to tired headlight lenses - and it keeps stuff out of landfills by eliminating the need for replacements.,1356739200,2012-12-29
5.0,"A neighbor recommended the Armor All Tire Protectant to me a year or so ago... he uses it religiously on his Corvette wheels. I picked up a can to try and was very impressed. I've used it many times since, and as I have gotten more skilled at applying it, I am even more impressed. It takes a little practice to become good at application, just like it does for spray painting, but once you master it you will spend very little time cleaning your wheels (or putting up with dirty wheels).I use it on BMW wheels. If you know anything about BMW brakes, you know that all you have to do is think about touching the brake pedal and your wheels are filthy! Very depressing after spending an hour cleaning them... but no more. Make sure the wheels are squeaky clean and dry - apply Armor All Wheel Protectant to them, using an even coating (nooks and crannies too) - and you will go more than a month without needing to clean them again. This is especially great if you live in an area where winter can be harsh, and grimey, and too cold to wash wheels.Here is another tip - use Armor All Wheel Protectant on the tips of your exhaust pipes - especially if they are chrome or satin. Be sure to coat the very end of them... and it will keep soot from building up on your exhaust!The product will slightly dull the wheels when you apply it, but very little. This is much more desirable to me than what they look like after just one driving...Can't recommend this enough - great stuff!!!",1352073600,2012-11-05

5.0,"This is a well-made quality item in that the cables and fitments seem of high quality as is the unit itself.This is not really a charger for your car battery, it's more of a maintainer. If you will not be driving your vehicle for a while, and it's parked outside, or you park near a window, you can use this to keep the battery from not draining down. Most modern day cars have some drain just by nature of all of the electronic devices that are powered all the time, not to mention alarms. If you don't drive for a few weeks, the battery may be drained. Using this device can solve that issue.It's nice that this comes with both the lighter port plug as well as direct battery terminal plugs includes. Some other ones do not come with both.",1362528000,2013-03-06

Using at the same time with some tire cleaners, it made cleaning out the wheels and rims a breeze. However two this I didn't like about the giant furry mace. One, it has a metal clip on the top of the brush, so if you're not careful, you can do serious damage. Two, it's huge! I mean you can sword fight with someone with this thing when the time comes.

I use the sunglasses spot for my gas card and gift cards.I like the adjustable straps since I have slightly larger than normal visors on my 2012 Nissan Juke and the one I was replacing was elastic straps that barely fit over it.

4.0,"Bought this for occasional jobs like changing oil and brakes.  I've used it twice now with a Toyota Camry and a Toyota Sienna and it performed well with both.  I did discover that to use the riser I first drove the car onto my steel ramps and then put the jack under to lift it up farther.  The clearance on my cars did not allow the riser to fit under the car without that initial life.  Without the riser it did raise up the cars, but not enough for what I was looking for.My jack worked right out of the box, and although there was some wear on the box, everything arrived in good order.  It raises and lowers as I expected, and it does lower slowly if you gently release the pressure.  I haven't given 5 stars because it does not scream high quality just from handling it a few times and seeing other jacks.  If this holds up over time I will update my review with another star.  All in all, a solid jack that does exactly what I wanted at a price I was willing to pay.",1376524800,2013-08-15

1.0,"The meguiar's hot shine high gloss tire spray is not impressive. When I spray the tire shine on my tires, I find myself having to go back after about 5 minutes and wipe it down with a towel because it leaves drip lines down the tire.  Kind of like if you put too much paint onto something and it leaves runs.  The consistency is equivelent to regular grade milk,  It is not a gel consistency.  Another issue I ran into is, I will let the spray dry on the tires for approximately 30-1 hour and I still notice that it shoots up on the side of my car makings spots on my rear bumper and front doors after driving.  I like using the gel type of tire shine better, that you brush on.  It flows on better without leaving streaks or runs and it sticks better to the tires, not the side of your car.  One last thing I noticed is when I spray the tire shine on my tires, it leaves a dark crescent shape on my driveway that lasts for months.  Not a big deal, but it angers me that it sticks better to my black asphalt driveway than my tires.",1381536000,2013-10-12

5.0,"The following review is for the Dynaplug tool.  This item is for the refill for that tool. The refills will store readily inside the handle.After living in Downtown Los Angeles for over 2 years, I have had about 5 bouts of tire leaks due to punctures.  Before I found out about this product, I used the traditional DIY method of repairing my tire--with a kit I got at Pep Boys.  It was always an exhausting, time consuming process.  I'm not a very strong person and most of the punctures were with small objects (pallet nails, staples). Imagine having to stuff a thick, dull rasp tool through extremely thick tire tread.. Not fun.  Threading a thick rubber embedded cord through a very thin slot was always a pain in the butt too.  Always ended up having to fumble with needle nose pliers to pull it through requiring  several tries.Along comes this product. All I can say is WOW!!!  Slick it up, insert the little plug into the tool, slick up the tool and hole with some more spit, and push it in.  The tool is smooth and goes in with way less effort.  Pull it out and snip the remainder.  Done!  By a very large margin, the absolute EASIEST tire repair tool you will EVER use.For *extremely* small holes, it can still require a bit of effort, but no where near the unimaginable effort that would have been required of the typical rasp and thread-end tools.  Just be sure to use spit.  (Water doesn't work nearly as well).Summary:PROS:-Makes repairing the smallest leaks much easier.-Fast.  Can repair a tire in half the time.  Some have even repaired their tires without removing them.-Permanent. Dynaplugs have been approved in Europe for permanent tire repair.-Use way less strength.  Only a single tool, and it is very thin.-Convenient storage in handle for extra plugs, and the pipe cleaner. There is enough room to even store a couple of small alchohol swabs in it.-Can be used to repair previous traditional plugs that have failed.-Fool proof.  Awesome design allows you to push the tool in ALL THE WAY, and pull out.  Traditional plugging can be pushed in too far or not far enough.-Can repair other failed patches.-Versatile.  Dynaplug can be applied multiple times to the same hole to repair larger holes.CONS:-The tool may get dirty on the inside and be hard to insert additional plugs in the same session.  The tool comes with a felt pipe cleaner which can be dabbed in alcohol to clean the inside.  Best way to avoid this is to ensure the plug and tool is well lubricated.",1326240000,2012-01-11

4.0,"At least read the one about how to turn off the alarm. I turned it on and it SHRIEEEEKED, which was GREAT but the landlady lives right across the hall from me and to keep her from running out her door having conniptions, I had to find a BIIIG pillow to put the BodyGard under until I could read the directions and turn off The Shriek. How loud is The Shriek? Well, if someone bothers you on the subway or in a bus or stairwell, the noise will echo from all four corners of the vehicle and if it does not stun the person it will at least draw ALOT of attention to you both. The button for The Shriek is flush with the BodyGard's body but I recommend hanging it from a zipper instead of putting it in a pocket, where a finger inadvertantly gripping it may cause a minor panic.The ring to hang this with is a decent size -- I would have wanted something larger but all I have to do is go into a hardware store and get one cheap.The knife to cut a seatbelt is a single(?)-edge razor in a setup similar to those free envelope openers they sometimes give out at the stationery store. It looks sharp enough - I hope it works. The user has to pull the red plastic cover away in order to expose the cutting edge, and that is simple enough to do especially since all you have to do is put a finger in the keyring and pull. In a real emergency situation I think that red cover will get lost in the process, and if so, I hope it can be replaced. Well, maybe it won;t get lost if your keys are hanging on it -- but ayway.. it's a thought.Flashlight beam is O..K.. a nice blue white light but not as intense as I think it should be. A second touch of the flashlight button produces a flashing red light which is GREAT.I would have like to have tested the glass cutter. It seems to be spring loaded and I hope it works. I could not find any glass (other than my balcony door or my apartment windows) on which to try it, and of course, with or without the landlady in such close proximity, THAT is a no-no.All in all, the Swiss+Tech ST81005 BodyGard ESC 5-in-1 Automobile Emergency Tool is a great, small tool that could easily save your life in many ways.",1377129600,2013-08-22

5.0,"ASSEMBLY: First you have to attach the high pressure grease hose to the head of the gun, making sure you use the supplied copper gasket before tightening down. Then, you have to attach your inlet coupler to the bottom of the handle, making sure that you use teflon plumbers tape on the coupler threads.INSTALLING GREASE CARTRIDGES: First, remove the pump head from the grease cylinder. Second, pull the grease loader (Also called follower) all the way back and then lock it into place. The side which has the simple pull off cap, that end goes into the grease cylinder. Then you pull off the sardine like lid, and then screw down the pump head onto the grease cylinder. Then you release the grease loader.PRIMING: Every time you install a new grease cartridge, you have to prime the gun. The quick way to prime, is to operate the gun slowly, until grease flows out of the coupler. If that does not work, you may have air pockets in the system. The manual recommends that you open the filler valve on the pump head by two turns out, holding the gun with the discharge hose pointing up. Then you close the filler valve once the air has been removed.OPERATING: To operate, attach the coupler at the end of the high pressure hose, to a zerk fitting. As you depress the trigger, air enters the chamber, which pushes the piston with the plunger. The grease that is under pressure from the plunger, opens the check valve and delivers one shot of lubricant. The more you depress the trigger, the faster this process operates, thus increasing grease flow. The gun is designed to have a full speed limit, as to limit damage to bearing seals and dust boots.EXPERIENCE: I think this gun weighs a bit much, but it has to be constructed of durable metals, in order for it to be commercial built. The body of the gun is constructed of a durable metal. The handle has a really nice rubber grip that I like, while the trigger is made of plastic. On both ends of the high pressure hose, heavy duty springs can be found. These springs are used to make sure the hose doesn't kink, I find they kind of get in the way, but I can get used to them, just have to have a good grip on the hose is all.I find its best to just let the bottom of the gun rest against the ground, this way you don't have to hold the weight for long periods of time. I like the 30"" HP hose on this gun a lot more then the 17"" hose on my old gun, as it allows me to get deeper into a place that has a grease zerk. Using this gun is so easy! All I have to do is press on the trigger a little bit, and grease will automatically be pumped into the grease fittings. No more hand fatigue, and no more useless time wasted, trying to fill the fitting with grease.One of the things I like that Lincoln Industrial did, is they incorporated their cover cap, into this gun as well! This is a great option, because when you are done using the gun, you can slide the cap onto the end of the coupler, keeping the grease from getting contaminated by dirt.CONCLUSION: This is the best grease gun I have ever bought! Not only is it made by a awesome brand like Lincoln Industrial, but its extremely durable. Despite a few of the negatives, I really like this gun. I can tell I am going to get a lot more use out of this gun, then my old one. This gun is not necessary for the home-owner per say, but is absolutely necessary for any small engine or automotive shop. 5 out of 5",1272067200,2010-04-24

It's very easy to read. I compared it to an old digital gauge I still use, my long-time favorite because it's so easy and reliable, and this one had exactly the same results.  The only slight inconvenience is that the reading doesn't lock on so that could pull it off of the stem to see, you must read while it's still on.  And then due to the shape you have to be a little on the one side to read it.  Really minor inconveniences, it's still very easy to use and seems to be very accurate and consistent.

4.0,"I purchased the 18"" Anco Winter blade because I needed a good wiper for my primary winter vehicle a 1994 Ford Bronco 4x4.  What's the use of 4 wheels in the snow if you can't see where you're going?  These blades proved to be excellent!  I was amazed, especially since I was reluctant to purchase these seeing as the ""normal"" anco blades haven't held up for me very well over the years.  I put them on right before either the first snowfall of the year or before it gets really cold.  No sense busting your knuckles, especially when its 0 degrees outside when the pain seems to multiply 10 fold.  lol.  I bought a set end of 2010, took them off when the weather improved and switched them to my ""summer blades"" and I just recently put the same set of winter blades from last year back on.  Tested them out, still work like new!  What is nice about these blades is the fact that they do not stiffen up with the extreme cold and they do not form ice on them when you use your windshield washer like the metal ones do.  We all know its a pain and dangerous bashing your wipers against your windshield just to get them working right again.  Which these seem to eliminate.  I would recommend them to anyone who has to drive in adverse cold weather conditions.Tips:Put them on before it gets cold/snowy.  No sense waiting until last minute and suffering!If they still work, SAVE THEM!  Use them only when needed through the winter season.  I stored mine in the garage through the summer.If you save them, wipe them down with a towel or cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol before putting them on.  This cleans off road grime and restores them to maximum performance.  A lot of reviewers complained about streaks, etc.  Unless the blade is physically damaged this can be fixed by doing so.If for whatever reason in extreme cold they do freeze, don't bang them and definitely do not try picking or scraping the ice off of them.  This will damage them for sure.  What I do is take some prestone windshield deicer and carefully spray them down a little.  Works wonders, just watch your paint.",1326499200,2012-01-14

2.0,"November 21, 2012 Update - Well these blades are not worth the extra premium price. They lasted just barely 9 months on my car. Normal life is a year (these are on a 2002 Buick Rendezvous - I've gone through roughly 9 sets of wiper blades, all lasting over a year). As I said in the lower part of this review, yes it was complicated to remember how to pull these blades off. They are different from all other blades around and those two little squeeze spots were hard to figure out after all this time. I won't be repurchasing these blades.The replacement blades I purchased this time are Michelin - a hybrid wiper, classic frame with full blade coverage:Michelin 5022 Stealth Wiper Blade, 22"" (Pack of 1)The original review:The Bosch Icon wiper blade is Bosch's top of the line frameless wiper. This is an outstanding blade that is surprisingly easy to install.The most important step with wiper blades, is finding the correct blade for your care. Gone are the days when I could go to a parts counter and ask for a 24 inch refill (refills don't exist anymore). There is a part finder on Amazon. I would also recommend using the blade finder at Bosch to simply double check the blades required. A lot of cars have two blades that are a different length. Oddly, my Buick Rendezvous did not have the third rear wiper listed, the part finders both places only listed two blades. There are also A and B versions of these blades, so be certain to pick the correct blade.The hardest part of installation is removing the old wiper blade. While visiting Bosch's blade finder, I stumbled on an excellent video that demonstrates how to replace wiper blades. Removing the old one is the longest part of the video. This particular blade is for the U shaped end of the metal wiper arm. There is usually a clip on the inside of that U on the pivot side of the wiper arm. It is also a good idea to lay a towel down on the windshield just in case the wiper arm jumps out of your hand - it's not unheard of to crack a windshield that way.The final step is to open the black plastic clip. Slide the U shaped end of the wiper arm through that clip and into the holder. Pull back and snap the clip down. The end of the wiper arm is now encased in lovely plastic. That's it, there's nothing more to do. Pretty simple.Replacing both wiper blades on my Buick Rendezvous at midnight, took me 20 minutes total, and that included washing my hands and recycling the packaging materials. I'll admit that I've changed a lot of wiper blades.The Icon blade is a direct competitor to the Goodyear Assurance wiper blade. It's pretty amazing to see these two blades side by side. The only real difference between the blades, the Bosch has an aerodynamic spoiler to help force the blade against the car window at speed. And the clip mechanism on the Goodyear is more universal, but leaves the clip exposed to the elements. Honestly, these two differences are nice looking, but I'm not sure they really make that much difference in the big picture.I installed the Goodyear Assurance blades about a year ago and couldn't exactly remember the clipping mechanism. So it took me a moment to remove the old blade. In a year or two when I replace these blades, I'm certain I will forget about how that plastic cover is clipped on, and will struggle just as much with the Bosch blades. In their marketing information Bosch talks about how the clip prevents snow and ice build up on the wiper blade. In all my years of driving in really bad snow storms, I've never seen a wiper blade have a problem with the cover to the attaching point.This is a good looking blade. Bosch and Goodyear both have eliminated that external frame with all the pivot points and metal or plastic holders - those really did get snow under them and create problems. They are now using a spring steel plate wrapped with plastic. There are no moving parts with this system. The rubber wiper blade is actually exactly the same as an external frame wiper - it sits inside a slot like all the rest. The end caps are attached tightly and should never fall off.Overall, this is an excellent wiper blade. Given that a wiper blade lasts for a good year or two, I think these are worth the extra cost over Bosch blades. I would shop based on price versus the Goodyear Assurance blades - they are virtually the same thing.Goodyear GY-WB765-22 Assurance Black 22'' Premium Rubber Graphite Coated Wiper Blade",1327449600,2012-01-25

I give them 4 stars because I have Anco blades installed on my other Elantra, and they cost about 30% less. They also work equally as well.

5.0,"Perhaps one of the biggest ripoffs in the auto repair industry is paying a shop or dealership to replace these cabin filters.  Though the first generation cars to use these could be a pain to replace, newer cars are insanely easy.  With no exaggeration, my 2008 Toyota could not take more than 3 minutes to replace the cabin filter.  Shops try to get $60 for this service of a $10 filter and, yes you are hearing this right, 3 minutes of labor. Dealers try to get even more.  Replacing the cabin filter  is a no brainer for most cars.  You Tube replace cabin air filter for your make and model and you will probably find someone who made a video showing how easy it is to do.

1.0,"I made the mistake of buying this tool to change my rear brake pads on my car thinking that I could get away with getting the cheap tool. I wish I would have just paid a little more for the right tool as this one was such a pain to use.First: There weren't any pin sets that fit my rear brake pistons. There was one side that had 4 house shaped pegs on the corners. I had to grind off two of the pegs and I could use that side. Those house shaped pegs were the only ones that actually fit in my car's pistons.Second: The metal is so soft on this cube thing that when the cube slips out of the slots in the calilper, the metal deforms and becomes rounded off, and it makes it that much harder to use. After it slips off about 10 times, it is almost unusable. I had to frequently go back and use my dremel to remove more material off the pegs to make them flat again on the sides that had rounded off.Third: Eventually those pegs got too small and they would slip out even though they weren't rounded off. I had to switch to another side that had two round pegs out at the corners. However those round pegs were too big, so I had to go back to my dremel to grind them down a bit to fit. Then started the process of slipping and grinding again.Fourth: This cube tool does not compress the piston while turning it. The compression comes from your arm pushing on it, and if you don't push it perfectly straignt, the cube slips. So, you can't put that much force on it. This leads to taking WAY longer to compress the pistons then it should take. With the proper tool that compresses and turns at the same time, these pistons should be able to be compressed in about 5 minutes each. However, with this tool, it took me over two hours to compress ONE piston.Fith: Because of all the grinding I had to do, this tool is now worn out and wouldn't be good to use again on another brake job. So I'm going to have to buy another tool when it comes time to do rear brakes again.There is nothing good about this tool. The only redeeming quality about it is that I was eventually able to get the job done. There were times in the middle where I thought I was going to be running to the auto parts store to buy/rent the proper tool, but it did make it through. It probably would have been quicker to make a trip out and get a new tool though.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this tool. I wouldn't buy any of these cube tools based on my experience with this one. Just spend a little more and get one of the rear brake piston sets that compresses the piston while turning. I wish I had done that, and I will do that for my next brake job (Since this tool is now trash).",1381276800,2013-10-09

It cuts through brake dust that soap wont even touch.however you cant really just leave it on for 30 seconds and spray it off. if the cleaner sits on one area too long, it begins to dry, and leaves behind residue.

4.0,Although made in China this jack seems to be sturdy enough. I tried it and it seemed to work fine jacking the car up but was sticky when lowering the car. The saddle (square on top of the jack) is flat and does not have the teeth that most jacks I've used have which grips onto the bottom of the car better. It also comes with a short shaft to insert into the jack. I suggest greasing the threads so they move easier. For the price you can't beat it but if you own a shop where it would get a lot of use I suggest buying something else.,1321488000,2011-11-17

5.0,"I have been using a jointless wiper blade ever since it became a popular replacement for the factory jointed type that is usually pre-installed when you buy a new vehicle. The ACDelco 24ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blade with Wear Indicator fits the bill when you need to replace or just want to upgrade to a better performing wiper blade. There was no rain yet in my little corner of the country when I got this wiper so to be able to give a comprehensive review, I have to ""simulate"" rain-like conditions by turning a hose with a shower nozzle on the windshield in the driveway of my garage. Snow on the other hand is a different story, no way for me to simulate that kind of weather event. It also worked well with frost accumulation on the windshield. It wiped away the frost smoothly, with no kind of hesitation or drag while in the wiping motion.My thoughts:Performance: the jointless type ACDelco 24ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blade with Wear Indicator is contoured better to ""hug"" your windshield with minimal resistance and pressure points. This translates to better wiping ability thereby enabling you to see better in inclement weather. Since it is jointless, this type of wiper gives you uniform wiping pressure, eliminating the pressure points or the ""streaks"" that you see across your windshield as it moves across the windshield. The curvature of this wiper is aerodynamic, it will prevent a lift-off of the blade even in high winds.Installation: it took less than 10 minutes to install the ACDelco 24ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blade with Wear Indicator without using any of the adapters for the wiper arm of my vehicle.Very satisfied with how the ACDelco 24ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blade with Wear Indicator has performed. It is a bit on the pricey side compared to other jointless name-brand wiper but gives you an awesome wiping performance. Highly recommended!",1357516800,2013-01-07

5.0,"The Bosch ""Evolution"" Bracketless wiper blade solves the problem of installation fitment with a convenient ""cap"" that lifts up to expose the wiper arm attachment point. Slip the blade onto the arm, close the cap, and you have a no-metal-parts, bridgeless, bracketless, full-contact wiper blade that resists freezing and ""blow-off"" at high speeds. Installation is easy due to the innovative design -- the hardest part of the replacement is getting the old blades off. Once you switch to the Evolution Blade, replacement is, literally, ""a snap"".I've tried 'em all -- Anco, Trico, RainX, etc., and these are the best wipers that I've ever used. Highly Recommended !!UPDATE: During a 1,150-mile trip to and through the mountains of Southern California, it was during a severe rainstorm that the Bosch Evolution Wiper Blades proved to be capable of performing perfectly under downpour conditons in the dark of night. Full, firm contact of the blades against the windshield gave a perfect wipe for every stroke -- we could all see through the windshield, but it was raining so hard that we couldn't see more than 100 feet ahead, anyways !!My daughter was so impressed with the Evolutions on my Grand Marquis, she ordered a 3-piece-set for her Land Cruiser -- from Amazon, of course !!Take a tip -- Check your wiper fitment carefully before ordering. The Land Cruiser mentioned above has a 20-inch blade on the Driver's side, a 21-inch blade on the Passenger's side, and a 16-inch blade on the Rear window.Modern windshield configurations have made different-size wiper blades common, so it all-ways pays to check.UPDATE #2 -- A 2,000-mile trip through the mountains of Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming during the late-summer ""monsoon"" was the perfect test for the ""Evolution"" wiper blades -- with torrential rains, Nickle-sized hailstones, and severe winds combining to bring visibility to near-zero, the Bosch Evolution wiper blades ran quietly, wiped clean, and stayed streak-free through it all !!My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon !!",1360368000,2013-02-09
1.0,"I really do like beam style wipers. They don't rust. They look nicer than the old fashioned style of wiper and they perform better in most instances... except this one.The 22"" ANCO Contour wiper I mounted on the driver's side of my 2007 Hyundai Accent (a parts match fit according to Amazon's part finder) won't conform completely or correctly to the curvature of the windshield. It leaves a section of the windshield partially wiped putting a streak of water a couple inches wide and right in my line of sight. I've tried cleaning the window and wiping down the blade but nothing solves the issue. A visual inspection of the 22"" blade reveals no physical defects or flaws.The 16"" ANCO Contour blade I have installed on the passenger side of my Accent clears the window without this problem.I have also noticed that at highway speeds above 65 MPH both blades seem to lift off the windshield and are less effective at clearing water away even though these blades have a spoiler built into them to cut down on this high speed problem.I really wanted to like these blades. They fit on my car without the need of a bulky and unsightly adapter like some other brands require you to use. Unfortunately looks aren't really an important feature in a wiper blade, performance is. And unfortunately these blades... just don't cut it.{Update}After just a couple weeks on the vehicle the 22"" wiper on the driver's side is leaving a four to six inch wide section of the windshield, right in my line of sight, only partially cleared.

Then I tried it without water and it was the same (I used the chemical guys spray bottle). My paint was not hot, and I even sprayed it on a towel and then wiped, and still got bad reside. Not sure if its the wax, but it took me 20 minutes to remove the black crap off with Meguiars Ultimate detailer. (Brand new dark blue car)  Right after I spray this, it turns black and streaks. It does smell good but that is about it. I'm really disappointed in Chemical Guys. I ended up returning the jug so I could get my $27 bucks back. Thankfully amazon is really good about returns.

5.0,"I just had my oil changed and it seems that today those quick oil change places are determined to sell every customer some ""extras"". I was told that I needed a new air filter as my was very dirty. I took a look and the filer which had about 10000 miles on it was a little dirty and really did not need replacement for serval more miles. I ask the employee how much a new filter would be and he said $16.00. I noticed it was not a name brand filter but rather a house brand. I politely advised him ""no"". I then purchased this FRAM which is a quality product for just over $10 and installed it my self in less than a minute. On the 2008 Commander there are tow small clips toward the front of the air filter holder. Just snap them loose and raise the cover. I would suggest you take you garage vacuum and vacuum any debris out of the chamber. Only takes  couple, of minutes and will give you cleaner air. Insert the new air filter and fasten the two clips. You have just saved at least 40% of the price at the garage. If your air filter is really dirty and perhaps has some dirty oil stains on the paper, why not change the filter first before going to the oil change station and that way you won't have to get into any discussion with the clerk about needing an air filter.",1311897600,2011-07-29

Make no mistake, as others have claimed, the build quality of this Item is great, but aside from the rest of the reviews, there is one aspect I haven't seen covered that MUST be addressed:The output voltage is way too high for any automotive installation application. after installing the solar array, I decided to take some readings to see what kind of output I was receiving, before finishing the install.First sunny day of April, 74degrees, and located in TN:Voltage: 24.2v in direct sunlightAmpere: 0.3Most 12v systems recharge at a voltage range between 13.2-14.7v via the alternator, or battery charger, Hooking this device in with a 24v output (even at low amps) can cause the battery to over-charge, the ecu to throw an over-voltage check engine code, or even worse, fry the ECU.devices such as lawn mowers, trolling motors, four wheelers, tractors, etc, that may not use or monitor battery voltage may be better suited for use with this, although I would not recommend charging even those batteries at such a high voltage.",1365292800,2013-04-07
5.0,"I bought this as a kitchen thermometer. I am on a quest to make perfect pancakes and could never keep my griddle at the perfect pancake temperature (360 F). I made the best batch of pancakes in my life after using this thermometer to adjust the surface temperature just so. And this morning, I made the best omelet I've ever cooked (at 325 F).I chose this model as it claims to have better accuracy than comparably priced competitors (1.5%, or 1.5C (3F) whichever is greater). This might not be good enough for medical applications, but for cooking, car repair, or home heating uses it's pretty good. Also, it claims a narrower beam than other products with a 10:1 distance to radius ratio, allowing more accurate scans at a distance. And, supposedly, one standard 9V battery will last 12 hours of use, which given that a single scan is typically 5 seconds might as well be for a lifetime.I've been quite happy with this product. I like the scan feature, where you can scan over an area keeping track of the hottest temperature. It's also nice that the optics are well shielded deep inside the device, making it unlikely I'll get fingerprints on them, and allowing me to stuff it in my pocket if needed.  And, I like the laser guide, which my son uses to play Buzz Lightyear (I'm very careful to not let him point it at his or my eyes).I'm so happy with this product, I'm thinking of giving them out as Christmas gifts this year.",1189555200,2007-09-12
5.0,"I have been using a jointless wiper blade ever since it became a popular replacement for the factory jointed type that is usually pre-installed when you buy a new vehicle. The ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19"" fits the bill when you need to replace or just want to upgrade to a better performing wiper blade. Got this just in time to coincide with persistent rainy weather we've been having in my state. Snow on the other hand is a different story, no way for me to simulate that kind of weather event. It also worked well with frost accumulation on the windshield. It wiped away the frost smoothly, with no kind of hesitation or drag while in the wiping motion.My thoughts:Performance: the jointless type ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19"" is contoured better to ""hug"" your windshield with minimal resistance and pressure points. This translates to better wiping ability thereby enabling you to see better in inclement weather. Since it is jointless, this type of wiper gives you uniform wiping pressure, eliminating the pressure points or the ""streaks"" that you see across your windshield as it moves across the windshield. The curvature of this wiper is aerodynamic, it will prevent a lift-off of the blade even in high winds.Installation: it took less than 10 minutes to install the ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19"" without using any of the adapters for the wiper arm of my vehicle.Very satisfied with how the ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19"" has performed. It is in the middle of the pack as far as price is concerned compared to other jointless name-brand wiper but gives you an awesome wiping performance. Highly recommended!",1367107200,2013-04-28
5.0,"Quick, Free, Amazon Prime shipping to my door.  Product was a easy install, no tricks to it.  Take your time after reading the direction and it may take 45 seconds each to install.Downside if there is one is that they are sold in twin packs, where as I needed three (two for the furnace and one for the tankless water heater), but now I have an extra should I ever need it and can remember where I put it.These are an inexpensive investment when you consider the cost and frustration of wasp or other critters nesting in these exhaust vents.",1391299200,2014-02-02

But from a style standpoint, it does dress up the tail light assembly. One bar does pass right in front of theback up light which does diminsh its function. Installation is very simple. Directions are clear. The item is a bit pricey but the quality is good and the paint job good. It is a simple way to dress up your ride.",1366156800,2013-04-17
5.0,"I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.  Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface.  Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.",1302566400,2011-04-12

So, I developed a buzz.  I bought the Dynamat to see if I could get rid of that, after I tightened everything that I could find.Installation was easier than I feared - thanks for the tennis ball tip, BTW!  As far as the real results, though, I'm not sure that I've noticed a real difference in sound quality, noise, or heat.  Perhaps some.

4.0,"Purchased this to maintain the battery in one of my vehicles that sits over the winter.Shipped extremely fast (received next day) and just got done hooking it up. I remove the battery from my vehicle because I didn't have any outlets near the car and I didn't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery (via alligator clips or ring terminals). I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged. It's been on for about an hour now, but that's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery, not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item, however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $15.95 with the unit for evaluation, shipping & handling. Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost. Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs. The darn thing only costs $40...why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty?All in all, I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy.***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase.",1294185600,2011-01-05
5.0,"Although I bought expensive potable water hoses for my motorhome and gave them a good rinsing before connecting them, I still detected that distinctive ""hose taste"" in my RV's water.  Installing this filter between the hose and my RV eliminated that taste.  It also filters out odd odors and tastes that I encounter with some campground water.  When there are high chlorine levels in the water, this filter won't get rid of all of it but it does knock it down.  Be sure to rinse the filter for about one minute before connecting it to your RV for the first time or you'll get black carbon powder in your water.  The included flexible hose protector works perfectly; enabling me to connect the filter directly to my RV water inlet without the need for any other fittings, allowing me to close and lock the access door.After using one of these filters for about a year, I would not consider ever connecting my motorhome to any water supply without having this filter on-line.",1351036800,2012-10-24

4.0,"When I purchased the Torin creeper seat I didn't take into account it might have a weight limit. I mean of course it would have *some* limit but nothing in the Amazon ad that I saw suggested a very specific maximum weight of a person that the seat could take.It was therefore disappointing to see on the packaging the words 'holds 250lbs!' in big lettering on the front. I'm a big tall guy at around 350lbs - heck if I was 250lbs I'd be a stick. So I thought I'd just squash it if that's its maximum weight limit... but I chose to assemble it anyway since it was so inexpensive and just see how it handled my girth. First thing I noticed was it was mostly nearly all constructed despite the assembly instructions indicating I would have to mount the wheels and the plastic to the base etc. In reality all I had to do was bolt on the U brackets and the seat. Done. Took about 10 minutes. The lower plastic was ever so slightly cracked though, due I'd say to over tightening at the factory but it's not a deal breaker and hasn't affected the functionality of the seat.Once together I sat down and swung around one of my bikes and began to clean it. I have to say that the seat made a massive difference in my cleaning routine where often I'd be laying on the cold floor. Now I'm sitting upright and much more comfortable albeit really low - I might source taller brackets at some point as it feels short for a man of my height.

I figured since Mallory is located/made in Canada, with all the snow that the Canadians get, they should know how to design a scraper that will get the job done, and they do.While I was waiting for this to ship, I spotted Mallory scrapers being sold at Wal-Mart; they had a different (longer) model with an aluminum pole instead of the plastic pole like this one has, otherwise the grip, scraper and brush are identical.  It was half the price of this brush (at Wal-Mart).  The longer brush, since it's aluminum, is lighter in weight and easier to maneuver when brushing the snow off.Rating:Shorter Mallory brush/scraper sold here by Amazon:  4 star ratingLonger Mallory brush/scraper w/aluminum pole I picked up at WM:  5 stars!Edited to add:  Sorry I don't know the model number of the longer brush, I peeled the sticker off and threw it away, but I believe it is this one:Mallory 999-CT 36"" Ultra Maxx Snow Brush",1294272000,2011-01-06

5.0,"My parent's SUV is five years old now and anything can go wrong with the battery.  Initially I never really wanted to buy a portable jumper because they were all too big and expensive and the small ones looked clumsy.  I stumbled upon this one and I knew just by looking at it that it would satisfy our needs.The JNC300XL is very sleek, it's small, and built like a tank.  It's heavy (about 10 pounds.)  I have the nice little trunk bag from [...] and this fits in there with their portable air compressor (very snug at that.)  One time we were at the airport and my dad left the lights on and we were stuck in the parking lot with a dead car in a creepy area.  Luckily for us, we were parked away from other cars and a nice person helped us out with a jump.  I don't think we might be as lucky next time.  When a situation like that arises, you wish you had something like this.  Again, I'm not for carrying a bulky jump starter because I don't like my trunk cluttered with stuff.  The JNC300XL is just the right size to carry in a medium-sized trunk bag. It just feels right when you hold it.I also like how it has a built in flashlight and you can use the 12 volt outlet to power a dead cell phone or some other 12 volt appliance.  The cables are nice and are 4AWG and the clamps are very sturdy.  Removing the clamps requires a little bit of force so keep that in mind if you are not as strong as you used to be or if you have arthritis.  Griot's Garage sells this same item for one hundred dollars under their name.  The only difference is they give you a lifetime warranty and their item is red in color.  I bought this from another online retailer for fifty-eight dollars plus shipping.  So do some shopping before you buy it.I'm glad I bought this item because even though you won't use it everyday, it is a lifesaver when you need it.

5.0,"Star Brite Star Tron Gasoline Additive.  I have a 10 HP Tecumseh engine on a 5000 Watt Generator that for the past two years had become difficult to start and wouldn't run without surging, back firing,etc.,  unless choked two notches . I'VE ALWAYS PUT STA-BIL IN THE FUEL TOO.  Now it does set for long periods without running though. Well after cleaning the bowl jets and still having problems I stumbled on this stuff. So ordered some, (what to lose ?) not much. I had emptied the old gas so put 1 gallon in the generator tank with the dose recommended (doubled) and started the engine. Still needed the two clicks of choke to run without surge etc. when started. I let it run for about two minutes and could hear a smoother sound coming from the engine. But it still needed one click of choke to run without surging. After 15 minutes checked and it ran silk smooth without any choke. Have checked it since and starts on the first pull too. I put it in a Robins 11 HP engine that was getting hard to start and it cured that within 5 minutes of running (cold starts too). Put it in my wife's old car and it runs smoother. Have 4 more small engines I will use this in too. I sound like a commercial but believe me this is worth every penny and cheaper than mechanics too. I have no doubt if used regularly in gas I won't have those problems again. I would recommend this to anyone for small engines, cars, etc. It really does what they say and the proof is in the engine performance.ADDENDUM: There are two concentrated formulas one 143XX for small engines and 930XX for Marine/Standard engines=(AUTO), (XX equals Oz in a bottle). The 930XX is a higher concentrate formula.  I received the 93032 (32Oz bottle) formula but was able to use it in small engines by reducing the amount per gallon and not wasting product that way. 10 Ml of 930(standard formula) is about the same as 1 Oz of 143(small engine formula) for 6 gallons of fuel. The company also says you can't overdose with this stuff. In other words if you put to much you just waste product not harm the engine. By the way 10 bottle caps full equal one Oz of product. Go to the Company web site and read how much to use and that way you will understand better what I have tried to say here. Take it from a 70 year old guy, This stuff is great. Everything I have put this in has increased the idle speed some .  Means water and crude has been removed . I put this in my new 2013 Kia Optima and two things happened, 1. increased idle speed and 2. increased the MPG 1 mile to the gallon. If you don't believe that that's OK I wouldn't and didn't when reading others say that. That car also expelled black crude from the exhaust pipes which is water vapor combined with carbon deposits caused by fuel burning cleaner. Decided we don't know what we are pumping from station storage tanks besides gas but the engines do. I've used this in 5 small engines, an older car, a truck, and a 40HP diesel tractor with improved performance from all of them. Great stuff.",1360886400,2013-02-15

If you put them on without hooking up your trailer, you won't be able to tell that there's a difference. Once that trailer gets hooked up though, you'll notice you can actually see. It's quite nice.Easy on, easy off. Built in little ratchet helps get the mirrors extra snug. Mirrors seem to be SLIGHTLY convex, which gives you a bit of a better view.Looking over at two mirrors is disconcerting at first, until you get your brain used to looking at the OUTSIDE mirror. This isn't the mirror's fault... it is the brain's fault. =PFew things: If you have plastic backed mirrors... like the trim molding that you often see on the tops of truck bumpers... the stuff that gets faded after too much exposure to the sun... yeah, that stuff. If you have that, the rubber gripper things from the straps will leave stains. I don't know if it's the agent they use to release the rubber from the molds or what, but it definitely leeches into the plastic. Some armor all on the rest of your mirror should blend it in.If your truck mirrors already have a vibration, these things will vibrate quite a bit.

It's ergonomic, with a clear LCD display that gave a fast, precise reading.Fast forward to the end of June. After only three uses (and being stored in my glove compartment otherwise), the gauge is now wildly off. After reading the tires on my truck as 32 PSI four weeks ago, plugging it in today registered 41.5 PSI. I thought maybe it was the heat we've had this past week, but a change of 9.5 PSI seemed a little high, so I tested it with two other tire gauges, which read 33 and 33.5 PSI, respectively. I used a pump with a manual gauge to drain a tire and inflate it to 33 PSI, but when I tested the tire with this gauge it read it first as 41.5 PSI and ten seconds later as 40 PSI.Perhaps I got a dud, but any gauge that's off by that much so soon raises a red flag for me.

You will need a 25/32"" drill bit for the switch, or you can use a 1/2"" bit and work it a little to enlarge the hole so the switch fits.

1.0,"Lots of glowing praise on this item and while I agree with most of the comments like great leverage, good in tight spaces, easily adjustable, long reach... and so on... it failed me miserably on the first use. I had a filter that was not ""hand tight"" as many expect them to be when they're ready to slide under and twist them off with just a light touch of pressure. The filter on my 1999 Expedition is right behind the bumper so I'm not sure if that placement exposes it more to the elements and makes removal more difficult or if the filter was last replaced and tightened way too much... last change was by a Ford dealer because it was a freebie. I clamped onto the top of the filter and it immediately punched holes into it with the claws that are suppose to grip the filter... and then came the oil down my arm. I tried again at the base of the filter where there's a little more metal and immediately got another set of holes. I went for the strap wrench but that wouldn't budge it either. I finally got it off with my KR Tools 12153 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliers. I know all filters aren't difficult to remove but I've been changing my oil & filters... plus most repairs... for about 50 years and this is not the only filter I have had problems removing. I will be purchasing a cap type filter wrench and have given this wrench 1-star because I could not get the filter off with it and it punched holes in the filter... and since this tool is pretty much useless for any other job it'll likely be donated or just sink to the bottom of my auto tool drawer. I don't care about the holes as much as I did the resultant oil leak or the potential that the filter may have to be removed in pieces. I'm also surprised that one reviewer talks about holes and how this wrench didn't cause any in the removal or install... and I think anyone who tightens a filter with a wrench is asking for problems. I have purchased quite a few TEKTON tools on Amazon from wrenches to sockets and have not been disappointed... until now. Lastly, if your filter is on tight you should be able to exert enough pressure with a tool to get it off without punching holes in it.Since I was able to get it off with the pliersKR Tools 12153 Pro Series 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliersthat would seem to be the better tool investment if you have a large filter... at least the jaws have more teeth for a better grip, the teeth are not likely to puncture the filter, it has a lot more potential for other uses where an oil wrench does not and the price is about the same. I have used the pliers on many other things without an issue or damage to what I was working on... especially good for my 1-1/2"" PVC irrigation and pump lines.",1383782400,2013-11-07

Comes with the hardware for the press-fit stud but not the bolt/nut on the axle end, so be careful removing the old stuff. I recently lifted the XJ and put 31s on and the old stabilizer was allowing too much bump-steer on uneven terrain so this suddenly became necessary. After driving around with it on, it seems to perform as well as the more expensive ones I have used in the past for similar applications. Hopefully the durability is also comparable or better.

2.0,This product smells nothing like &#34;New car&#34; but is not unpleasant. The freshness only lasts a few days. My chief complaint about this is that it is not so much an odor eliminator but more of a sense of smell eliminator.After using the product as directed and getting using the vehicle the next day I noticed that the tip of my tongue was numb and that my sense of smell was diminished while in the car and for a couple of minutes after leaving the car. I cross checked this by blind testing my wife and a friend of mine and they both had the same numbness/deadening on their tongues and reduced sense of smell.I use Meguiars products frequently and love the non-aerosol spray odor eliminator and will continue the use of that product but never again will I use this product.,1399507200,2014-05-08

5.0,"The biggest concern someone would have in purchasing a device like this is its practicality both in installation and use, and the overall results. Is it worth purchasing a $35 solar charger to maintain a battery? If you have a vehicle, or sit down mower, or motorcycle that is used infrequently especially for longer periods of time it is a very worthwhile investment. Running a battery all the way down to being totally uncharged is not the healthy procedure for maintaining the overall life of a battery; not to mention having to take the time and inconvenience in order to recharge a battery before using a vehicle that isn't on a trickle charge.The challenge that confronts us is how to mount it in such a way that it can get juice to your battery without having to remove the battery from the vehicle or wind up with the hood open a crack creating a trailer park scenario of the car with the hood open hooked up to a charger.The beauty of the NOCO BLSOLAR5 is that it comes with two hookup wires. One is the typical battery hookup with two clamps that would go directly on the battery poles. The other wire is the cigarette lighter adapter which would feed your car battery without even having to lift the hood. So for the ultimate in convenience you could just place the solar panel on your dashboard facing your car toward the south, or underneath a side or rear window where the sun rises and sets and get a good charge with only the cigarette lighter plug in attached. If you wanted to use the car there wouldn't be hardly any inconvenience at all simply unplugging it and moving the solar panel aside.The other practical use would be if you have a shed housing your garden equipment such as a sit down lawnmower you could attach this solar panel outside through the 4 mounting holes on each corner and run the wire inside. You can hook it up using the battery charging clamps wire and forget about it for the winter.Now onto practicality in terms of price and return on investment: solar panels have a life expectancy of about 20 to 40 years. Without going into the formulas I accessed regarding how much electricity a typical trickle charger uses, the results were a range of $1 to $3 per month. So you should expect to recapture your investment in this NOCO Solar Battery Charger in 1 to 3 years of constant use. Solar panels having a 20 to 40 year life expectancy beyond that makes this a no-brainer in the long run; if it were 40 years at $3 per month for a regular trickle charger that would be $1440 added to your electrical bill. You also have the advantage of being a go-green supporter considering that no fossil fuels or nuclear fuel was spent in making the electricity.So let's add it up. It will pay for itself many times over in the long run. You have the convenience of keeping a battery topped up so the vehicle, motorcycle, ATV etc. is always at the ready, and it will preserve the life of your batteries which aren't cheap by keeping them topped up. Great idea and glad to see solar hit a price point that makes it very practical. Highly recommended.",1366243200,2013-04-18

I saw in other reviews that the space in other Ford vehicles is tight, but there's plenty of room in the Ranger.It's not obvious which way to turn the screws for up/down or left/right, so you have to experiment. You just flip the wrench around to turn the other way. Unlike regular ""clicking"" ratchet wrenches, the fine-ratchet capability on this tool makes it easy to do micro-adjusting, and it also makes sure that you can turn the headlight screw even if you have only a short swing on the ratchet handle.(FYI: for the Ranger, the bottom screw is vertical, top screw is horizontal.)A great tool, makes an otherwise crummy job simple.",1335484800,2012-04-27

4.0,"I have been usingMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Systemon my car for a number of years, but only recently tried Griot's Garage Clay kit for the first time.  Overall, Griot's Garage did the job, but I liked working with it less than I like working with Mother's clay.  I will explain the differences below.I am attaching a collage of two photos under customer photos.1) The stock photo is somewhat deceiving as it makes you think the clay fills the nice container it is shipped in. Photo #1 shows the clay in the plastic wrap is it arrived. The amount of clay is sufficient to work with, I am not complaining about that, just the photo makes you think you get a lot more. The container itself is very nice for storage. Mother's clay does not come with a container and I had to come up with a plastic container of my own. A tip on storage: before storing the clay ball in the container wet the outside of the clay ball with Griot's Speed Shine or any other detailing spray. This makes the clay easier to take out the next time as it sticks less to the container.2) Photos #2 shows the 35 oz of Speed Shine which came in this kit. Speed shine has almost no scent, provides good cleaning and is easy to work with. Its spray trigger (included  in this kit) delivers a generous even spray of liquid. Because it is a generous spray the solution is used fairly fast. On the first application of clay I used 1/4 of the bottle. I think I will be able to get 4-5 washes out of this bottle.The clay worked well to remove debris. It took more swipes to remove debris with Griot's clay than with Mother's Clay, but the results were very good. The clay itself is softer and fairly sticky and my hands were slightly yellow when I finished, and there was clay under my nails.  This does not happen when I work with Mother's Clay system.  I was able to remove the residue from my hands using Griot's Speed Shine followed by a vigorous washing with soap.  This made working with the clay less enjoyable.  For example, when the phone rang while I was cleaning my car I could not pick it up because I had clay all over my hands.A tip for short people: I am fairly short so reaching the middle of the roof of my Honda CRV to clay it is difficult. I found that that I can do it if put the clay ball under a triangle-shaped Windshield Reach and Clean ToolStoner 95161 Glass Reach and Clean Tooland use it to rub the clay ball on the parts of the roof I can not reach.  The reason why it works better than other tools is because its surface is concave to follow the windshield shape and that curve holds the clay ball without the ball sliding out.Ali Julia review",1343001600,2012-07-23

4.0,"I generally liked this product. I loved its being so much smaller and lighter than traditional battery chargers. However, there was a big issue and a variety of small annoyances.The big issue I encountered was that the charger never transitioned to Maintenance mode (trickle-charge). I had used the car in a way that didn't recharge the battery (series of very short trips on a cold night with a passenger that insisted on using the electric seat heater). I could hear the weaker rev'ing of the starter. When I got home, I connected up this charger, but 8 hours later, the status lights indicated normal charging mode, when I would have expected it to have long been in trickle charge. However, the battery seemed to have been fully recharged (from healthy sound from the starter motor).Related to this is the absence of a finer-grained charging status, for example a 3- or 4-element bar. On traditional battery chargers there is a gauge showing the voltage difference between the battery and what the charger is supplying. As the battery charges, the needle on this gauge drops. This lets you know when you are close to charged, or that the battery isn't taking a charge. And when you are initially connecting the clips, it helps confirm that you have a good connection. For example, I know from prior experience with these traditional chargers that there are several bolts on my engine block that would seem to be excellent grounding points, but aren't (insulated by thread-lock glue?). When I experimented by attempting to use these bolts, this charger gave me no indication of this problem -- the status lights were the same as when I connected to a good ground. Consequently you don't get an indication of one of the most common problems using a charger -- an inadequate connection of the clips.The hanging hook is a very useful feature. Unfortunately it seems to be made of a very brittle plastic. While it may be adequate for hanging the charger on a wall, it is grossly inadequate for the pictured use of hanging from the hood latch -- a situation when you are likely to be frazzled and may inadvertently stress the hook. When I encounter features that apparently compromise quality for trivial cost-savings, I always wonder if there are hidden ones critical to the functioning of the device.The product is better than what is pictured. Instead of a cord ending in battery clips, it has theBosch C35AC0 Quick Connect Cable Harness for C3 Battery Charger with Built-in Cable Fuseto which the battery clips are then connected. This harness provides the option -- which I didn't test -- of being left attached to a battery to provide a simpler and surer connection of the charger, and is especially useful for infrequently used batteries that are maintained on trickle charge (for example, boats, classic cars). Also, if the charger is to be used by someone who just can't understand the concept of where to connect the clips, this is an excellent accommodation. If you use the charger with multiple batteries, you might consider getting some/all of them their own harnesses. Additionally, my experience is that this is the part of a charger most likely to be damaged, and it is an advantage that it is easily replaceable.Although the manual is very short, it could be much better organized and laid out. Before you get to the two pages of operating instructions, it has four pages of warnings that should be obvious to almost anyone likely to be using this charger. I know that these are required to be there, but the way they are presented may well cause impatient or easily frustrated people to just stop reading. The big annoyance involves a very nice feature: The cover folds out so you can see a keyed picture of the charger while you are reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the legend for the keys (numbers) is not provided until after those names are being used (in the ""Warnings""). And the basic instructions for operating the charger, including turning it to Standby before unplugging, is not in the ""Operating Instructions"" but part of a long individual ""Warning"" at the end of the ""Warnings"" section, and consequently easily to miss.DEFICIENCY: The manual for this product is available only as hardcopy. Because so many of my product manuals are available in electronic form, my ""bookshelf"" is on my computer and portable devices. This had the advantage of not only having manuals readily available and easily searchable, but it is easy for me to add annotations and bookmarks (I use the free FoxIt Reader as alternatives to Adobe Acrobat as well asNitro PDF Professional V6that is much cheaper than Acrobat, especially during its frequent sales and rebate offers).DEFICIENCY: No registration for this product. In the old days of mail-in registration cards, processing them was often an expense that wasn't worth it. But on-line registration is very inexpensive and something I would think well worth it for notifying customers in case a problem/defect is discovered in this product.What were they thinking?: The manual suggests using the packaging for storage, but that packaging is probably too fragile for anything but infrequent use where you are very careful taking it out and putting it back in: The cover is very thin plastic (reinforce-able or mend-able with normal packaging tape), and the base is a little more substantial. The packaging is closer to what you want to minimize the amount going into the waste stream.========================Advice for purchasers:The manual tells you to cycle the charger into standby mode (blue ring) before unplugging it (but doesn't say whether that is to protect the device or you). I found this to be non-obvious and thus hard to remember. I used my label maker to put this reminder on the charger (but Bosch, it would be nice if you had this on the next version).-- Douglas B.

5.0,I have been an RVer for several years and have been wanting to get either a backup camera system or backup alarm. Choice the alarm. It was so easy to hook up. I tested it and heard it from the cabin of the RV. Pretty amazing to me. I mounted it just above the rear license plate so it was accessible to the tail light assembly. I like the total weather proofing of the device. I just coated the terminals with liquid tape to keep water from rusting the terminals.,1392768000,2014-02-19
5.0,"I had used this product before and was looking to purchase more. It is not available where I live so I had to order it online. This wax is a paste and is easy to apply with a slightly damp cloth or applicator. I am currently using it on my boat and cars. I would suggest working a smaller area to avoid the wax drying and becoming harder to remove. If you stay in a 2x2 or so section it is easy to put on and take off. It leaves a very slick surface and a good shine. If you use a carwash soap for cleaning, the wax will remain for quite some time. I have noticed it seems to hold up well on the boat in saltwater as well. That says a lot for anything in the Florida sun.",1345680000,2012-08-23

5.0,"Well there isn't much too much to say about this product.  It is exactly as it is described, and comes from a trusted name.  I recently purchased a brand new car and am obsessed with keeping it clean.  I did a lot of searching online to find the best possible products to clean my car with.  No matter where I looked, it seemed that everyone was recommending Meguiars products.I gave this mitt a shot and am beyond impressed.  The mitt stays clean and dirt free which is perfect.  It does a great job of holding soap in during your wash, to a point where you could honestly wash an entire side of the car with one good dunk in soap (although this isn't really recommended, just making a point hehe).  I use the two bucket method, and the great part is that when I ""clean"" the mitt in the water bucket, it instantly releases any dust or dirt that it picked up.  By the time I am done cleaning, the mitt is still white and crud free, while the bottom of the water bucket is filled with junk.I plan on actually getting another one so that I can use one for washing and the other for removing wax.  I highly recommend this product.",1282521600,2010-08-23

When I went to check the blade, I noticed that the entire wiper blade was coming off the hook and it was barely holding on. How dangerous is that? Not only could it have hurt someone if it came off, I could've put myself and other vehicles at risk if it did fall off when it was raining.The direct connect system which snaps shut to ensure that the blade will not wiggle off provided me ease of mind and the design of a spoiler to increase contact to the windshield wiper while you are driving..

5.0,"I have been using oil extractors for a few years now, namely the Pela 6000 marine pump.  Although I am well experienced with cars, I currently have my oilpan drain plug replaced with a temperature sensor, so I prefer not to remove that and risk damaging, plus, I hate having to get under the car and pray not to spill oil everywhere.The Pela pump was great, the big issue was that there was no easy way to drain the container and if you weren't careful, while draining you would tip too far and cause an air bubble which made oil dump out with some force and splash everywhere (think of turning a 2liter bottle upside down).  Unfortunately I had to toss out the pump because it was starting to leak some oil out of the handle.I read some great things on automotive forums about the Mityvac, and was ecstatic to find this particular model that can not only pump, but easily evacuate fluid as well.  This comes in real handy when dealing with fluids such as brake fluid and transmission fluid.  On top of that, it provided me a VERY easy way to extract oil from the pump back into the bottles ;).The pump worked like a charm, and did exactly what it is intended to do.  This is great for my car because although the car holds about 5 quarts of oil, conventional draining from the pan only drains out about 4 quarts as oil is still left in the oil coolers.  Because of the vacuum that this produces inside of the oil sump, I manage to evacuate almost every drop of oil from the system.One note is that you MUST tighten the screws holding on the top cover.  They are a tad loose when you get the pump, but can easily be tightened and you do not have to worry about the leaking that others have experienced.",1325721600,2012-01-05

And the canister seals well and appears very robust - a weak spot with so many auto products these days.This wax is even more solid than the old ""Classic"" brand standard of decades ago, and its smell is much more pleasing. Reiterating from other reviews: find a shady spot, ideally outside in the shade of a tall tree that is not hanging over the car to drop sap and misty pollen on your project.Work quickly over a small area and make your way around the car. It's worth the effort. Another reviewer mentioned P21S. While I've never used it, I know many car-club concours enthusiasts love it.

The light output is considerably higher which is a HUGE plus and the lighting distance is about twice the distance of the OEM lightbulbs.Good range + good light output + 4000k color temp = Safer.

3.0,"This item is made by Clore Automotive, stating it is a US manufacturer.This item is their ""top of the line"" with heavy duty cables and heavy duty battery.The cables do not stick very well in the clip-on mount (built into the carrying handle), twisting them a bit helped.The unit comes with a one-time lifetime repair voucher of $50. Impressive, considering the purchase price.Checking out the details before and after purchase revealed severe issues when checking for proper operating and maintaining the unit.The manual(s) for the unit, either the one that came with the item or the one online, call for a immediate charge upon receipt of either 12 hours or 24 hours. The times for charging after use or regular storage differ dramatically as well.Contacted the manufacturer. Answer was that ""it does not matter if 12 or 24 hours"". So why wasting a 12 hour charge if it does not matter and the unit still has full capacity? Does it have full capacity? Answer ""Should not be critical"". What???Contacted the manufacturer again regarding maintaining the charge after use or when in storage. Was told that ""it does not really matter"", just charge it every 90 days.This is in complete contradiction to the 2 different manuals for this unit. Lack of quality, an American issue, still present.So what is there to do now? Sure it will start a vehicle once, then how is it supposed to be charged? How is it supposed to be charged when not in use? How long will it last?Well, it is a small and supposedly powerful unit, so lets wait and see.Update:Ran the 1000 amp battery on a conversion van completely down (listening to weather radio when the tornado hit a few weeks ago at a Michigan campground). Turned everything off in the car and attached the unit to the battery, then waited about 3 minutes (should be common sense, to allow electricity to float and settle). The little unit turned the engine over with no effort at all. It certainly provided a satisfactory effect first (by not being stranded) and a ""wow"" effect right after. Quite a accomplishment for a small unit like that.The unit was recharged for some hours calculated from the different statements the manufacturer made, somehow in the middle. The unit got us going, and for this price it might be worth keeping it.",1306972800,2011-06-02

I consider the kit highly worthwhile, and the project a success.Be sure to watch the YouTube video before using, and they are not kidding about taping around the lights.

I really could have used more for the Volvo.I was able to use the final-stage sander (the ""Pryzbitel"" disk or something like that) and sponge buffer on a second vehicle, an 8-year-old truck with visible but less severe clouding.

5.0,"I am not a detailing professional but I do like keeping my cars looking new. I have bought 2 brand new cars since 2009 and I have kept them looking new by buying all kinds of car caring products. I visit a lot of different car forums and collect the best car care products including cleaners, wax, tire shine etc. If you need advice on recommended tire shine, cleaners, car wash, write a comment. I have heard about liquid glass before but I wasn't convinced that it was as good as people say it is. I was tired of applying wax all the time and the results were great but it didn't last long. I bought my second car several months ago and I wanted to keep it looking new all the time without applying wax every week. I almost purchased OptiCoat 2.0 because many people say it is a permanent coat on top of your clear coat and it lasts well over 3 years. I decided not to buy it because I don't think my car will keep looking new for three years after applying a product one time. So I did some research on other products and I came across liquid glass again. This is a very old product that has been around for over 20 years but the formula has slightly changed over time. The ownership of the company has also changed but the product is better than ever.It's very simple to apply and keeps the car looking shiny and it is somewhat permanent. Since my car was new, I didn't use a clay bar to get all the materials off the paint. I simply used the liquid glass pre cleaner and then applied liquid glass polish. You have to make sure the paint is clean and defect free. If you have rock chips, I would recommend applying touch up paint first because the liquid glass will permanently seal those chips and will be hard to fill later. I applied one layer of liquid glass using a microfiber cloth one section at a time and let it dry for 15 minutes and then cleaned off the haze using another cloth. Make sure the temperature is at least 50 degrees and there is sunshine. After doing the entire car, let the car bake in the sun for about 4 hours and apply another coat and let that bake. After my second coat, my car looked better than new and I am not kidding. It is a white car and it had a deep shine to it. I can tell that there is a layer of protection on my car. It has been two months since I applied the two coats and to this day water just bounces off my car and dirt barely sticks to the paint. I also applied liquid glass to my mirrors and windows. It's funny to see the water sliding off my glass when it rains. It is very easy to wash my car now because the dirt does not stick to the car as strongly as it used to. Liquid glass can be applied many times as desired without removing the old coat; it is actually recommended that you apply multiple coats. The more coats you apply the deeper the shine gets. I have read in many places that after about 20 coats, the paint will have a lot more rock chip protection. The layer will get thick and will protect your original paint from chips. Obviously you can't expect total protection because rocks can fly at your car pretty fast.  I am waiting for better weather to apply more coats. I actually bought a gallon of liquid glass from autobarn.com for around $60. You should not apply any wax on top of liquid glass if you plan to apply more coats because you will have to remove that wax before applying another coat.",1392768000,2014-02-19
4.0,"I know, I know, my ""whiney"" is showing in this review. I wanted a normal sized but strong ice scraper to go in my truck for the small areas and windows I can reach on my own and this absolutely fits the bill. Great handle shape, nice non-slip neoprene like cover for the ""hand"" area of the handle. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of five is for the individual that was asleep when they loaded the product image and/or the person that placed my ice scraper in the box for shipment. That is because I'm one of those ""Type-A"" guys that gets a little too far down in the weeds when I research and then select an item for purchase. If I see something in a picture with a blue handle that adds to my liking it and the product description in no way says anything about ""colors may vary"" then I expect to open the box  upon arrival and see a blue handle.

However I want to keep the car in run-ready condition, so I try to start it every couple weeks or so. But I usually forget a time or two and the battery dies.That was the incentive behind my purchase of the Jump N Carry. And I can tell you it is a perfect little device. Not very big (and not terribly heavy), it's very easy to clamp onto your car battery. So far my car has started on the first attempt (been used twice now).When not jumping my stored car, we keep the Jump N Carry in the trunk of our main car -- just in case we need it or some other motorist needs a jump.I recommend this product.EDIT: March 16, 2011After one full year in the trunk, I just tested the battery and it's at 75 percent.

5.0,"I remember seeing ads for this on TV since I was a kid.  I never believed them.  I've tried other products like Mother's Gold (which is great, but required a lot more work) and Turtle Wax spray on (which does not work as well).  So last weekend I had some free time and wanted to put a coat of wax on the car before winter came and did the usual damage.  Did one coat which took about 20-25 mins total to apply and buff off.  By the time I was done the sun was setting and it looked good.  The I woke up the next morning and wow.  I'm not going to say my car looked brand new but there was a definitive glossy shine on it that I had not seen in a long time.  Granted it is a bright yellow Mazda and it usually looks good, but after one coat there was a glossy clear coat finish look on it that was amazing.  I could see my reflection almost like looking into a mirror.  With something like Mother's Gold which costs a lot more and lord does it take a lot longer and a lot more elbow grease to use, you will get a similar result.  But with this, one coat, little over 20 mins and very easy on the elbow grease and I got the same result.  I'm going to throw everything else out as I will never use anything else.

3.0,"I thought this would be a quick and easy solution to muffling the rattles emanating from a 1998 ford.  I was wrong. The product is a fairly hard black vinyl with an adhesive back.  Designed to be used on metal surfaces, it must be applied when temperatures are higher than 40 degrees farenheit. The surface must be thoroughly cleaned. The mat may be sized by cutting with scissors or in my case an exacto knife.The backer is removed and the mat is positioned.  Then ideally, the mat will fit securely and the offending noises muffled. If necessary you may use a blow dryer or heat gun.Sounds great. But it isn't quite so easy. First, it being winter in NY, I had to wait until the temperatures rose. I had planned to use this in a door. But the material is inflexible, cuttable, but still inflexible. Worse, I couldn't get it to stick in position. So I wound up taking it off. My brother then took the remainder for the back floor of his suv. He had better luck getting it to stick using a heat gun. He is satisfied with its noise muting capabilities.This product was not for me. Unless you are adept at accessing the offending parts and fairly handy, this requires significantly more work than the package suggests. When properly applied, it does seem to work. I wonder if the adhesion is effected by heat as well as cold. Obviously, the material becomes more brittle in the cold and does not adhere. Conversely, in high summer heat, does it melt or become gooey? I dodn't know. I think the product can perform adequately but unless you are experienced with this type of installation, I would pass.",1365379200,2013-04-08

5.0,"BAFX ELM327 Bluetooth OBD2 Adapter, Revision 1.5I purchased this based on all the positive feedback on Amazon, however my primary vehicle is a 2000 Ford that uses J1850 PWM. This protocol seems to be a point of contention among the ELM327 clones. Just doing a search within the BAFX product reviews show that some people cannot get it to work with PWM, and only a few more recent reviews indicated it will work. I am happy to report that it works fine on my PWM Ford. I can also confirm that this BAFX ELM327 works on a 2007 Ford Mustang (CAN Bus) and a 2009 Chevy Cobalt (No idea what GM uses).The Torque Lite and Torque Pro apps are all that I have used thus far, and my Galaxy S3 detected the BAFX ELM327. The code to pair it was ""1234"". The PID readouts are fast, I have no complaints about lag or delay.My only complaint is the size of this BAFX ELM327. On some vehicles it isn't a problem. But on the 2 Fords, one aims it straight down onto my throttle leg although there isn't any contact. The other Ford jams it straight into my clutch foot and there is contact! I have to twist my foot to the right to avoid the BAFX when using the clutch. The GM vehicle and Ford van was fine because the OBD2 ports were parallel with the dash and aimed straight at the driver without obstructing my legs.Overall: 5/5 stars, the actual product could have been made smaller to not obstruct the driver on certain vehicles. It sticks out quite a bit on some vehicles. Great price, solid construction, and worked properly on my J1850 PWM Ford.",1363996800,2013-03-23

3.0,"Pros:* Sturdy construction* Looks decent* Was a good buy at the Lightning Deal priceCons:* Instructions suck - but it's fairly easy to figure out. Put together in a half hour. WIth instructions that didn't suck, it could have been 15 minutes.* As others said, box arrived in TERRIBLE condition. It's amazing all the pieces were still there* Too pricey at the non-special price* Mine arrived with a few scrapes and a badly dented mesh floor panel. I pounded it back in shape, but it's a bit tacky if you look closelyCould Go Either Way:* Heavier than I expected. My wife will never be able to hook this up to her care by herself* Would have preferred it to be a few inches less wide. It looks a bit funny on the Focus as it's almost as wide as the car, and definitely wider than the back end... and that's an awful lot of torque/leverage to put on the 1.25"" connection point. (much better on a standard 2"" hitch)* The bar that goes into the receiver can rotate 90 degrees to store the platform on the back of the vehicle in an upright position, or flat, up against a garage wall, whichever you prefer, but when extended horizontally, it adds an extra foot to how far behind your vehicle the platform sits.Other Notes:I stuck this thing on a 2012 Ford Focus and on a Dodge Ram and instantly hated it. As you can see in one of the customer photos, it sticks WAY out, and on a small car it just looks ridiculous. There's around 20 inches between the bumper and the backside of this platform.The good news is, and I don't think the instructions mentioned this, if you don't care about being able to fold it up at a 90 degree angle, you can remove the entire pivoting piece  and the platform will still plug right into the receiver, matching pin holes and all. By leaving off this piece (which I don't care about anyway since I'm not going to leave this thing on my car full-time) you save a good 10+ pounds, lessen the torque load, and bring the platform to a respectable 9 or 10 inches (even closer if you don't have to use an adapter) from the bumper where it doesn't look so dang stupid.However - as feared - if you want to use this on a small car, you will likely have a class I or II hitch with a 1.25 inch receiver, and by using an adapter, you introduce two points of sloppiness to the mechanism, meaning the platform can move and tilt. I don't think it's bad enough to cause you any problems as long as whatever you are carrying is securely fastened down, but you might feel it jumping around a bit as you drive. I'm wondering if I can shim it a bit to get rid of the excess play. The sloppiness if much less on a 2 inch receiver with no adapter.Minor other note: my car came with proximity sensors to warn you if there are kids or obstacles near your car. With the platform attached, the alarm stays on solid when you are in reverse gear. It thinks you're about to run over a tricycle or something.

2.0,"After reading such rave reviews everywhere, I decided to change my manual trans oil in my Mazda 3 to the Red Line. I changed it at approximately 50k miles. Unfortunately, I'm not happy with the results at all.The main reason I decided to change to Red Line it was because I had read it was supposed to do better in cold weather than the stock oil and I figured 50k was a reasonable time to change it (yes, earlier than manual recommends). The stock oil was very stiff to shift with when the temps got into the teens and below, but shifted fine for the most part when warmed up or in warm weather. Now that I've put the Red Line in, shifting is frustrating and notch-y at all times. It can be difficult to get into first and second gears. Warm up doesn't smooth it out. It is indeed less stiff in the cold, but at the cost of poor shifting the rest of the time.It's been almost 5 months now, and I REALLY wish i didn't change to this oil. I'm thinking I'll end up switching to something else (or back to whatever was stock) this summer. So much for &#34;Improved shiftability&#34; and &#34;Helps prevent hard shifting.&#34; Wish I could share in ever one else's success.",1363219200,2013-03-14

5.0,"Carnauba has always been the best wax to use for cars.  This Griot's Garage Premium Carnauba Paste Wax is no exception.  Just apply a thin coat of wax in small areas and then rub it with a soft rag to polish.  It will protect your car's paint finish, make your car shine, and make water bead up and run right off.  Just don't try to work large areas at a time or it will be harder to rub to a polish.  This Griot's product was obviously intended to be used with one of their random orbital polishers (which I don't own) so it does not come with an applicator.  But any foam applicator available at your local Wal-Mart or auto parts store will work fine.  It takes some elbow grease to work any wax into a shine by hand, but it is not as difficult with this wax as it would be with other brands of paste wax.  A little goes a long way with this stuff.  The instructions tell you not to wait until the wax turns white to wipe it into a shine, and this makes waxing your car a faster job.  The remaining shine is very good -- my car had a showroom look to it after I was done, and I waxed by hand.The main downside to this product is it is incredibly expensive compared with other brands of carnauba wax that are readily available.  It costs probably 4-5 times as much as other brands of carnauba car wax.  It does polish a lot easier than other brands of carnauba wax, which may be worth its higher cost if you wax by hand, but if you own an electric polisher you really don't need to spend this much to get a great shine and protect your car's finish.  If you want the best carnauba wax out there, though, this probably ranks right up there.",1367884800,2013-05-07
2.0,"I purchased this tire gauge becuase I wanted a digital display gauge that provides1 psi resolution. While the Accutire MS-4021B generally does the job, there are twoannoying features that should be changed :1. Batteries cannot be replaced by the user2. On some valve stems, the Accutire MS-4021B does not make a seal to get an accurate readingRef. #1 : you have to send the gage in to the manufacturer who will replace the batteries free of charge. However, their turnaround time is more than two weeks, and I had to call their service department both times I had batteries replaced to get a replacement tire gauge.Furthermore, the batteries do not last more than a year or so, but I use tha gauge on a weekly basis for all my vehiclesRef. #2 : this appears to be due to the chuck design, i.e. the contact pin does notprotrude far enough to allow a positive seal on some valve stemsI am still searching for a digital tire gauge that allows the user to replace the batteries",1257033600,2009-11-01

They were so bright my wife asked if they were legal.Several things, you have two grounds, make sure they are grounded to a good metal surface, I used sandpaper to remove the paint about the size of a dime for my grounding points both in the engine compartment.If you have a narrow mounting location, you may want to consider the slim lights, these are heavy and shaped like a motorcyle headlight.The only negative thing I can say is that the light covers with the smiley face went out in the 80's. I painted mine black and placed a vinyl KC sticker on them. Looks much better, but still ordered the KC rock light covers so you can turn them on at any time without removing them.

5.0,"I can't believe how great this unit works. It was extremely easy to set up. I replaced an older Tekonsha, a non digital unit. This is so much nicer. Very much worth the money. I just returned from a trip and one feature that I realized is... Braking power starts arounf 2.0 when the brakes are hit. If the unit does not sense slowiing down much or angle change, it actually releases to .8 to 1.2 or so. This keeps you from dragging with the trailer than you really want to. I set my unit up so when the brake pedal is pressed, the trailer starts to slow the vehicle down slightly. If I do not brake much, it will lighten up. If I begin to brake harder, the braking power to the trailer increase proportionally as needed. It will go to 6 if it needs to. This is a very smart unit. I really like the feature to hold the button down when brake is engaged to go into reverse mode. This disables the brake controller for a set time for manuvering without brakeing at the trailer. Very nice.I highly recommend to anyone wanting electronic brake control.",1382400000,2013-10-22

Your car can never be clean enough, but it is important to note that the Duster works well on dust and not dirt and I am pleased to say that it does a fairly good job of removing dust and related particles from the surface of your vehicle.As mentioned, after thoroughly washing your vehicle, the Duster can help maintain that showroom finish that we all desire.  I have owned about three of these dusters over the course of the last two decades and they are well-made.  I just recently purchased my third duster after having used my last for about the last decade.

I expected some difference based on the claims made for this Royal Purple fuel system cleaner but It made no difference at all. I cannot detect any difference in how the truck idles or runs.

The sandpaper ""handle"" could've been better, as mine broke apart once I was done with the first sanding stage. Make sure to apply the UV protectant about once a month, or your headlight plastic will most-likely start to suffer again.EDIT 1/5/14: Since my original review, the headlights are now back to their old yellowy gross appearance.

5.0,"I'm not sure if praising cleaning towels means having Manly Points deducted, but these little towels are amazing.  Extremely versatile, they can be used for everything from washing the car without risking micro scratches on the paint to washing dishes.  They're reusable, of course, so make much more sense than wasteful paper towels.  Microfiber cloth is electrostatic by nature and so attracts dust like a magnet. Their design also allows them to be effective in removing many types of dirt without the use of any additional chemicals making them safer for use especially with households that have infants and children or persons with allergies or hypersensitivity to chemicals. They're more absorbent than a sponge and since you're more likely to toss them in the washing machine than a kitchen sponge, they're much more sanitary, since the kitchen sponge is said to be the most germ infested location in the entire house. Even the multiple colors they arrive in is a plus if you want to designate one color for car use, one for kitchen only and one for misc. cleaning.  As with any fabric product, it's always a good idea to do an initial laundering before using them to dry or clean anything food or kitchen related. Don't use fabric softener, though, when washing them as the oils in those products will clog the microfibers and reduce the cloth's effectiveness. It might be noted that microfiber is made from synthetic materials that are petrochemical based and so are not biodegradable and can emit toxins when burned. Also, towels used on sensitive surfaces like your car's paint, should kept separate for that use only, since other applications might embed particles in the fibers and make micro-scratches more likely. This is one high tech product that really makes many low tech chores a lot easier and more effective.",1266883200,2010-02-23
5.0,This is one of the necessary evils to keep my vehicles looking good. It is not a lot of fun but it gets all the contaminats off your vehicle so you can polish. Comes with everything you need. Just spray the lubricant on the vehicle and on the clay itself and start rubbing. It is amazing how much comes off even after it has been washed. I normally do a 2 ft x 2 ft section and refold the clay after each section is done to get a clean side. When it becomes pretty bad I use it to clean off my wheels.

I am NOT a mechanic but I can do the maintenance side of things. I hooked this up on the left side of the drivers side dash and it worked. Pulled the code and it was the MAF sensor, which I already kind of knew anyway. I have a new MAF sensor on the way and will update this. I was able to clear the code several times and the same code comes back. At this point it has more than paid itself off. The MAF thru the dealer was 325.00 plus the troubleshooting fees. Updates coming.On the Subaru the plug for this is on the left side right by your knee so if you are going to order this and leave it plugged in for me you need to order the extension cable.

I cannot think of a single challenge in either of these fields where they've either not already had in their product mix a perfect solution or where their engineers didn't come up with one very quickly. This Clean Sand Kit easily lives up to their stellar reputation and I was very pleased when I used it to sand several large skim coat areas of our newly remodeled kitchen at how effectively it did the job and kept the vast majority of the resulting dust safely in my shop vacuum. I previously had a somewhat similar device from Hyde that I was less then happy with (both from the effectiveness of the abrasive medium and how well it captured the resulting dust).

Not every season but often enough we have had to take the battery out to be charged at Sears or somewhere else. Or they are sluggish when starting up in the spring. This solar charger is a good solution to priming the battery before start-up.While I wouldn't keep it out all winter I did use it to juice up our tractor this spring. It was very easy to attach (like any set of clips for a battery) and I placed the solar panel in the sun and let it sit for a few days.When I went to start the tractor, it almost didn't turn over (uncommon, without using the charger) so for a second, I was afraid I had actually drained the battery instead of charging it.But then it roared to life. Yeah!I had some concerns though. This is a glass solar panel (I'm not sure it could be anything else) so I was concerned that it would fall over or get knocked over and break. I'm not sure there is any way around this but it is difficult considering that it sits outside. I know it can be mounted somewhere for a more permanent placement which could keep it safer but finding somewhere that gets enough sun and is the right angle can prove difficult.Additionally, the cables are short.

3.0,"This 3M sound reduction mat's appearance is best likened to gasket material according to my husband who has a great deal of experience with such things...just in case you wanted to have a better handle on what it looks like.The main limitation of this mat is its size. It is ideal for speaker use, but any larger application will require multiple sheets. If we wanted to use this in our door panel, we would  probably prefer to buy a larger sheet or product and place it there in order to maximize the sound reduction through consistency and lack of gaps as well as to reduce the weight that several of these mats would ad. We park along a curb or sidewalk nightly and already have to finagle opening our passenger door to get out of the car. If it were just a bit more weighty with this material, it would be more difficult to keep it from scraping the concrete. Anyone using this mat for a large surface area would need to consider such issues.However, for a speaker or speakers, this would be fine if you can find the temperature sweet spot that allows for an easier application.

4.0,"Just like everyone else who has reviewed this hitch I had the same results.  My welds were all solid and overall the quality of construction was very good.  The square tube the receiver slides into was a little cockeyed.  It isn't quite square with the brackets so when the hitch is installed it is slightly rotated to the right.  With all of that said the hitch and wiring were $62 shipped, nearly half the cost of what a resse hitch alone is without the wiring.  I'm very pleased and I have no worries at all towing anything with this hitch.  If the receiver portion wasn't slightly twisted I would give it 5 stars.  The harness is good quality, the wiring is durable and thick, not flimsy harbor freight quality.  If you are doing a lot of mods on your jk and trying to stay on a budget I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this.",1371427200,2013-06-17

5.0,"I used microfiber in the past and just love the way they pick up dirt and stuff.  These I got a 36-pack for like 23 dollars.  That is quite a good deal considering buying these seperate can cost 2-3 dollars.  Anyways, the size isn't too large and it isn't too small, it's perfect.  I also got 12 yellow, 12 green, and 12 blue which I was hoping because I didn't want all one color like some people claimed.  I took the advice from someone else who ordered them.  I have the blue ones in the garage for the car, the yellow in the kitchen for the countertop and dishes, and the green ones upstairs in the laundry room for upstairs use.  Each one has a tag on it on how to wash it and stuff, which I don't like but I don't want to pull it off and ruin the towel so it will stay on I guess.  Anyways, I bought these for cleaning my car so it gets dry and I use them for dusting.  It's a dust magnet, the stuff really shines after quickly wiping them off with one of these towels.  Good towels and definately worth the money without question.:Update:So I have been using these things for a couple days and let me tell you, what a great value for what you get.  These things pick up stuff so well.  I just washed our kitchen floor with one of them and it picked up almost every single hair and particle imaginable.  It used to take me like 5 wipes across with a regular rag to get the stuff but it sticks to one of these things so simple.  I hope it comes out in the wash though, I tried to squeeze some of the stuff out and some came out but not everything.  Either way it made the cleaning so much easier.  Maybe I will have a dirty one dedicated to just the kitchen floor so I don't ruin them all.  Anyways, go out and get these things you won't regret it.  They are worth more than a dollar a piece and Amazon's deal is fantastic.:Update-2:I have had this same pack of 36 for probably a year now.  I am down to my last few though, so I am going to re-order.  I used them very heavily and 23 dollars lasting me a year, these things are way worth it.  I used them to clean my car interior/windows.  I used them to clean kitchen sinks and coffee tables.  The dust these things pick up is remarkable.  I used them very heavily to clean our tile kitchen floor and wooden floors.  I think that's the reason I threw some out because they got so picked up with dirt and grime.  Our kitchen floors take in heavy traffic and after using these with some all purpose cleaner on the kitchen floor, it looks like new.  For dusting stuff off they are amazing.  I don't know what else to say, but I am pretty sure this is the longest review I have here on Amazon, and I have quite a few reviews.  These things have made our house spick and span, and I am a very picky cleaner.

It packs the power, the portability, and function that you would expect from Energizer.The cup shape is awesome.  If you have used an inverter before, you've likely had it sitting in your floor.  While this takes up the space of a cup holder, the ease and access to the ports makes it worthwhile.  You can plug up a laptop or tablet or several other gadgets into the AC power.  Or use one of the 4 USB ports.  If you travel with a laptop, tablet, GPS unit, phone, or countless other items, then this cup inverter will almost always come in handy for you.  If you have a laptop that requires more power you may wish to opt for another inverter.  Personally, my primary use is for all the USB ports, especially if you are travelling with multiple people as you can charge several phones at once.

5.0,"These are great tire covers. Then again, I'm outside Phoenix, AZ too.  These covers are loose-woven cotton canvas with a wire tension backer for quick-on/off.  They are NOT vinyl or vinyl-backed. When it rains, it is going to get the tire wet. They are good for a little wind-blocking, and UV blocking...but aren't going to help you a bit when it comes to rain or dust.I got them because out here in the desert, if you don't UV block your RV tires, you will be buying tires every single year, even if you don't put a mile on them...the sun is brutal to tires! These are like sunblock for your tires...I've used them before (then again, I've used old T-shirts, too), and they work excellent...but if you are in Louisiana, or Tennessee, or South Carolina, or anywhere else you are going to get 50-70-inches of rain each year with lots of year-round humidity...they will rot in no-time, and doubtful do anything to help preserve your tires...in that case, you need VINYL COVERS. (Here...we are lucky if we get 10-inches of rain a year...during a two-week time period...rot is NOT a problem).Bottom line:  Be aware that tires dry rot because of two things - OZONE and UV in combination.  You can't keep Ozone or Oxygen off your tires...so you break the 'dry rot cycle' by blocking the sun.  If you are in a dry hot climate and need sun protection...BUY THEM. If you are in a rainy place...take a pass, and look for vinyl (also a good sun-block, but it won't rot like canvas does when wet).",1346544000,2012-09-02

3.0,"First, this is a good product if you want to tint your tail lights on a budget.  However, there are many drawbacks to using this product.Pros:Affordable alternative to otherwise time consuming tinting or opting to take it to a costly shop to have it done ""right"".When done ""correctly"" you may achieve good results.  However, doing this job correctly may take some knowledge with painting/color sanding and other prep work related to body work.Cons: Easy to mess up, by messing up I mean getting runs from spraying too wet/close, nobody likes the runs.Does not hide imperfections.Easy to apply too much when you think you still might want them a little darker.There really are no instructions on the can.  Do not expect the can to tell you what to do/what not to do.  From MY experience with this or any product I can however give some general rule of thumb tips.  Some will still have their drawbacks.This is how I did it:You will need:  Dawn dish soap.  Original formula!  Not the newer ""ultra concentrated"". Spray bottles at least 1, 2 are better.  Latex or equivalent gloves.  2000 Grit wet sanding paper.  Running alcohol 50/50 water mix.  Water (obviously), masking tape, a solid flat surface to work on, quality lighting, quality ventilation, and the VHT/Clearcoat, of course. Finally, A LOT OF PATIENCE. Optional:  Meguiars ultimate compound, microfiber towels, a dual action polisher/soft buff polishing pad.Step 1.  I REMOVED my tail lights.  No sense trying to spray them on the vehicle, unless you want to spend all of the time to mask it off correctly at which point you would have them off by now anyway.Step 2. PUT LATEX or VINYL GLOVES ON!!! You'd be amazed at how much oil your hands are producing and believe me, it will effect your overall quality of work.  I followed up my soapy water wash with a 50/50 alcohol/water mix for final prep prior to sanding.  I thoroughly cleaned the tail lights with good old fashioned Regular dawn dish soap and warm water, followed by a rinse off.  Sounds cheap?  You'd be surprised how far back the ORIGINAL formula dawn dish soap has been utilized in the body industry, it is a great degreaser.Step 3.  Put a new pair of gloves on. Don't want to get waterlogged or have water running out of them.Step 4. Mask anything on the light that you don't want sprayed, IE: Inner edges, reverse light, whatever. I wet-sanded my tail lights with 2000 grit sand paper and another solution of dawn/water via spray bottle.  Keep the paper/surface wet.  Make sure you sand the entire surface uniformly and with mild pressure.  Don't try digging yourself through the other end of these lights, we will get to the reason why I myself chose the 2000 grit and nothing more abrasive or nothing at all a little later on.Step 5.  Rinse off your headlights, lightly towel dry them and inspect.  Let them dry completely.  They will appear hazed/foggy.  Any spots that you missed or didn't scuff up enough will retain it's original gloss and should be corrected prior to advancing to the next step.Step 6.  Once you are satisfied with your wet sanding I recommend following up with another misting via spray bottle of 50/50 water/rubbing alcohol to be certain that the tail lights are free of any dust/grease particles prior to painting.  It never hurts to be safe and by the time you are done doing all of this work you will either thank yourself in the end or curse yourself for not taking that one last just in case effort.Step 7.  Apply light, uniform coats of the VHT night shades spray tint.  I applied my first coat at a distance around 8-12"".  Maintain some level of overlap to assure uniform coverage I recommend anything from 25% overlap min to 50% overlap max.  Spray the edges first, work quickly yet taking your time, if that makes sense. Depending on humidity and temperature I would let the first coat sit for bare minimum of 10 minutes before applying any additional coats, if its cool or humid wait about 15 minutes, don't fall into the urge of touching the surface to check whether or not it feels dry to touch, especially if you ever plan to use your tail light for committing a crime.  Your prints will be etched into them and forensics will be all over it.Step 8.  Let it dry, dry, dry, I recommend waiting a bare minimum of 45 minutes to an hour before clear coating.  You do not want to let the clear coat blend into the paint.  This might be overkill but if you clear too soon your lights will look dull/cloudy.Step 9.  Apply clear coat, some people recommend as much as 4 coats, 6 light coats, whatever you desire basically.  Clear coat is a little bit different, you should spray it on wet enough to assure you don't have ""dry"" little specks all over yet it is very easy to get it to run.  You have already gotten this far without messing up so just like painting take your time.  Spray the first coat on light, follow up with one, maybe even 2 wetter coats. I think anything more than 3 general coats is overkill.Step 10.  Let it dry, dry, dry, no, it's not ready to be touched yet!  Let it dry for as long as possible before handling.  I would recommend letting it dry no less than a few hours before handling, just to be safe.  If possible, let it dry for at least 6 hours before re-installing them on your vehicle.  If it is going to rain later on that day/night I would recommend just installing them the next day.OPTIONAL..  There are 3 possibilities here.  You are either finished at this point, if so, congratulations on a job well done!  OR, you can continue on to the steps, OR, you have made a mistake and are not satisfied.  If you have made a mistake swallow your pride and let these things dry for as long as possible before attempting to follow all of the steps over again if going the sanding route.  Acetone, goo gone, or whatever you might consider using works great when the product is still in its out gassing/curing stage if you would go the quick fix method where time is money.Step 11. You may have noticed orange peel, (little bumps all over the place)  Don't worry, you didn't do anything wrong this is entirely normal with clear coat.  This can be corrected very easily by letting the lights dry for no less than 24 hours IMO and gently once again wet sanding the clear coat smooth with 2000 grit wet sandpaper. Same soapy water mix, light pressure, work a little at a time and a squeegy works great for wiping off residue to show you how much work you have left to do.Step 12:  So you are all smooth, and now your work surface looks like crap.  Darn, he got me, all this work and now it's all hazy/messed up.  Did I just scare you?  You can remove this haze by using Meguiars ultimate polishing compound(which I used) or equivalent.  I have a lot of experience with a dual action buffer I used gentle pressure on a low speed and lightly agitated the surface with my soft buff foam polishing pad. Work it long enough and you can probably achieve comparable results by hand.  I followed up with a finishing glaze/gentle hand buff for optimal results.Step 13:  Now those are some nicely smoked tail lights, congrats!So I gave a lot of steps, everyone has their own feedback based on their own experience, or lack thereof, are all of these steps necessary to everyone?  No.  But, they were how I was taught and my overall desire to make the most out of my $20.00 spent.  I just recently did a full repaint on my 1994 Ford Bronco Eddie Bauer that used to be a rust bucket, no, I didn't use spray can I used PPG omni urethane automotive dual stage paint w/my spray gun and achieved great results.  I wouldn't have achieved those results without proper preparation/precautionary measures, painting is actually the easy part of body work.  So I didn't want to throw a hurried up/half asked job of tail light tinting on my otherwise nice looking vehicle.  I am an automotive detailer and have my share of experience in the field of auto body work as well so I am very picky about how something looks, especially when I do the job myself.Either way you get what you pay for and this is a ""spray can"" job.  Following my own knowledge I made the most out of what it is and they turned out rather nice.  I wouldn't recommend more than 2 coats as 3 is too much IMO (I've learned from my own mistakes) and like the other reviewer said your lights can be very hard to see through especially in the day time because of it.  1 coat offers little results (too light, just barely darker than stock) and 3 too dark, 2 seems just right IMO.  Unless you like that really black look and aren't too concerned about safety for yourself and others, or if you are doing really light coats.Make use out of the flash times between coats and do yourself a favor and walk away.  It is far too easy to get a sense of urgency and over excited and want these things back on your car/truck.  It's MUCH better to wait 5 minutes too long than 5 minutes too soon.  And for heavens sake, DON'T TOUCH!  At least not yet.  Try to do this on a day when the air temperature is at least 65 degrees with low relative humidity.  Dry warm air works much better to help you than cool/moist air.  Try doing this in a dust free/bug free environment.  I have too much experience painting in my own garage and for whatever crazy reason bugs seem to LOVE the scent of paint materials...  I actually bought a garage door screen to help prevent them from coming in yet still provide adequate ventilation.  That's just me though, I didn't buy it for this purpose I bought it for purposes like this on a frequent basis.Safety first! (yet I managed to think of it last) If you are really worried about health wear a particulate respirator and safety glasses.I know this is a long review and I know everyone has their own opinion on what should/shouldn't be done.  The reason I listed the tips is for the new to this type of work person that has an interest in undergoing this project on their own with little knowledge on how to do it.  If you have old/beat up lights to work with consider replacing them before undergoing this project. OR:  Wet-sand with a 1500 or even 1000 grit paper and follow up with a 1500-2000 grit.. Personally I know from experience that the 20 year old tail lights on my vehicle that were scratched and scuffed didn't turn out well... I replaced them and now I am much more satisfied with the end result.One final note, - THE REASON IT ONLY GETS 3 STARS - I promise it's the last thing I'll say... For the skeptics/what to REALLY expect.  If you wet sand with the 2000 grit paper you will likely see minor imperfections under the paint/clearcoat  This is why I didn't do anything more abrasive than 2000 grit... This will show more prominently under direct light instances and up close inspections..  This is because this tint/clear coat really doesn't have any filling properties like you would expect out of a primer.  With that being said, obviously you can't prime your work prior to painting in this case so you either have to accept a some imperfections OR you could go the route of NOT wet sanding and go straight to painting after a good cleaning but I wouldn't do this... The reason why I wouldn't is from my own experience when you don't do some light scuffing the paint tends not to have good adhesion at all.  Making it much easier to create runs and or peeling in the more immediate future than the next guy.",1336521600,2012-05-09

The filter media is well supported and intact, and there are plenty of fine particulates trapped.  The oil that I've drained has looked decent (for used oil) too.I've owned, ran, maintained, and rebuilt a LOT of engines.  And, while I don't have a standard or favorite brand of filters and lubricants, I do try not to buy cheap junk.  K&N; seems to have a good industry reputation, and their price is fair.

4.0,I just detailed my Corvette and tossed the old cloths I had and purchased some new ones. I opted for the Mequiars and they were excellent. As with most of these type cloth they quickly absorbed whatever it is you are trying too remove whether it is detailing liquid or wax or the grime from a clay bar. I have to use several clean ones on each vehicle I clean however I have been able to wash them and get them back to their almost original condition. The biggest drawback i have is the cost for each cloth. I am shopping for a lower cost substitute.

The instructions for replacing the used filter are incomplete as they do not address the touring model which has a slow release lever to open the lower glove box gently. It must be detached first. Then the stops on both side must actually be removed (they are designed that way) to lower the glove box and access the filter holder.

4.0,"I ordered the full-size, set of 4 floor mats for our Chevy Avalanche, which is mainly driven by my husband and is his work truck. The product description states that these mats are designed for an exact fit and Avalanche is listed as one of the vehicles for this size.Unfortunately the full-size mats are a little too small for full coverage in the Avalanche. They are about and inch or two too narrow in height and width. This wouldn't be a problem in dry weather, but we live in the Midwest, and it rains and snows a lot. That exposed, unprotected strip of carpet will get dirty in no time.A second problem is there is no ridge on the edge of the mat to stop melting water from snow trapped on shoes and work boots from running into the carpeting. Also, the runner for the back is too short to fit lengthwise and would need to be cut into two small mats. Technically these mats will fit if you don't mind a little carpet exposed, but my husband opted to keep his old mats that provide 100% floor coverage.Happily, these mats fit my Mitsubishi Gallant, a mid-size vehicle, almost perfectly. They give full coverage and run right to the edge of the carpet, with only a little trimming needed at the top. I am thrilled. I needed new mats but didn't see an option for my car. Before cutting, the full-size mats are approx 28 inches long by 19 wide.The mats are made of heavy rubber and have a strong, sturdy feel to them. Even though they are designed with a rugged look for an SUV, they look nice in my car. They lay flat, grip the floor and stay put. There are deep grooves in the rubber to contain dirt, debris and moisture. Since the mats run to the edge of the carpet, I don't think snow/water runoff will be a problem, but I won't know for sure until winter.",1405036800,2014-07-11

4.0,"This is a pretty decent little tire gauge. For the price, it's a great little tire gauge.The Good:- I think mine is pretty accurate. I've compared it to 3 other gauges and it's within 2 PSI of them. It's also pretty consistent with readings, which is a good thing.- There is only one button, which makes it easy to use with gloves on. This is very nice in the wintertime!- The little light throws just enough illumination to find the valve stem in the dark, which is nice.- It can measure in PSI, KPa, Bar, and Kgf/cm2. Which must be nice if you're .... Swedish?The Bad:- It's not the easiest to seal onto the valve stem to get a good reading. You sort of have to press and wiggle.- Batteries are difficult or impossible to replace. There is no little battery door - you'll have to take the thing apart to see about new batteries.- My clumsy hands frequently bump the button. This changes the unit of measurement to KPa, which I don't know how to read.I like this thing, and I'm sure it'll give me years of usage, as long as I can figure out how to take the thing apart and change the batteries.

5.0,"I needed this to maintain a bunch of batteries although I have a few Battery Tenders already.  I use them because experience shows me they work and Deltran always stood behind their product when one went south on me while under warranty.  This year I took home the 3 boat batteries which were added to the two waverunner batteries and the motorcycle and the summer car.  This unit took care of the boat and the summer car and they work great as long as you buy the available entension lines so you can get them all out of your way and into the corners of the garage where you won't trip over everything.  One plug for 4 independent units is nice.  Easily worth the price if you need to regularly maintain 4 batteries and don't appreciate turning the ignition on next season and only getting silence or that weird clicking sound.  This is particularly painful on a boat when you're ""ready to go"".  Jump starting is not an option and what a hassle on the water - rutting around inside the bilge area.  Just turn it on and leave it alone.  The internal programming takes care of all the rest.TRUE STORY:I used my firt Battery Tender on my 1999 Porsche since new and only this year replaced the battery while having service performed and told it wasn't properly holding the charge - after 13 years.  That made me a believer for life.  Never have I had a battery last me anywhere close to that - not even half that.  New Porsche batteries are $200 +/- installed.  I will say that I did check cell fluid level annually and topped off with distilld H2O since it was a non-sealed battery from Germay (Varta?).

5.0,"I used the Vital Brandz leather cleaner and conditioner on our two vehicles: my wife's pickup truck and my SUV. Neither vehicle has any leather, but the SUV has a vinyl dashboard and door panels, and the pickup truck has vinyl and plastic door panels. The pickup truck is 18 years old and has not had a thorough interior cleaning in some time, so the door panels were pretty filthy with ground in dirt and oils. Using a clean rag, the leather cleaner was remarkably effective in removing the dirt, and after some buffing, it looked great - maybe not like new, but very much improved. On the plastic section of the door panel, the leather cleaner was not as effective in removing dirt, however.On my SUV, the dashboard was pretty clean, but a little light buffing after wiping on some of the leather cleaner shined it up nicely. I've used several cleaning and protective products over the years, and the Vital Brands cleaner and conditioner appears to be as effective as any of them on vinyl interiors. I'll be interested in using the product again in a few months when the sun and the scorching summer temperatures take their toll on a car's interior finishes.For now, though, I'm pleased with the product. It certainly appears to be effective for cleaning and conditioning vinyl.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",1388966400,2014-01-06

Simply use the enclosed rachet, and screw it open.  Presto - you're chocked!I use a socket and a cordless drill to extend my stabilizer jacks, and the same socket fits this chock.  Talk about convenience!The screw-head has holes which can accomodate a padlock.  BAL sells one for this chock, but I found that a normal padlock (skinny u-clasp, slightly longer than a 'normal' padlock) can work just fine.My wife accidentally tried moving our trailer with the chock still in place, and after a foot or so the chock was ejected from between the tires.  A small cotter-pin broke, and BAL sent me a new one for free.  What service!Consider buying the 2-pack, and use one on each side.  I've tested it, and two chocks DOES provide more stability inside the trailer than a single chock.  Although, if you don't care about the extra stability, ONE chock WILL keep your trailer from rolling away.Sure, the traditional wedge-shaped block of plastic will work just fine.  But I've seen those blow away if they weren't kicked in hard enough, and nothing would keep someone from stealing them.

3.0,"Camco 43544 Bamboo Cutting Board with Handle costs approximately $14 and I believe it is over priced for its size. It's sufficient for small prep jobs. I wish is were twice the size for the price. Bamboo is actually a type of grass not wood.  Bamboo cutting boards are hard, plus the fact that they are very resistant to bacteria. Regular wood cutting boards, over time, get grooves in them where bacteria can get caught and transfer to food. This is especially true if the cutting board is not cleaned properly.You need to &#8220;season&#8221; bamboo cutting boards regularly &#8212; which can be time consuming. Seasoning will prolong the life of your bamboo cutting board. To season your board, first wash it with hot soapy water. Then, wait for the board to dry. Once it&#8217;s dry, saturate the board with food-safe mineral oil. Wipe the mineral oil off. Repeat this process at least 2 more times before using it for the first time. After that, you&#8217;ll want to re-season the board every month. You have to wash a bamboo cutting board by hand. It cannot be put in the dishwasher because there are more glued pieces that could come apart than with regular wood cutting boards. Bamboo cutting boards are more expensive than regular wood cutting boards. In fact, they&#8217;re among the most expensive cutting boards on the market today. Way too high maintenance for me.Some bamboo cutting boards are glued together with adhesives that have formaldehyde in them &#8212; which could eventually leak into and contaminate food. When buying a bamboo cutting board, make sure that it has a non-toxic label on it in order to avoid this. Personally, I have used dozens of different brands of cutting boards and find the Epicurean boards a better choice than bamboo.",1395792000,2014-03-26

Note, though, the warning that cigarette lighters are for 100W.  If you want 500W you need a battery to connect to with the alligator clips.Basically if you have this, a 12V battery and a battery tender/charger, you've got a nice, generic home backup power supply which, while not remotely as robust as a generator, is a cheap and convenient way to power your gadgets in a power outage.",1378339200,2013-09-05

This helps me ensure a clean oil change... as clean as it can be.  Not sure why they chose 17mm for the bolt size, but whatever.  What I wasn't excited about was that, at least for me, the black paint seemed to not be ""as black"" as the Harley filter, or it may have faded or been affected negatively by road salt or something.

2.0,"In an attempt to keep my new leather dash from ever getting warped again, I looked into this product, given overwhelming number of positive reviews.As the name implies, Leather Honey is a thick, translucent fluid that flows with a consistency not unlike corn syrup.The instructions on the back reads:Leather Honey revitalizes stiff, weathered leatherand softens, protects, and extends the life of newleather. May darken some leather, but originalcolor usually returns over time. Use on all typesof leather except suede.DIRECTIONSNew Leather: Using a paint brush, sponge, orlint-free cloth, cover entire surface area withLeather Honey at room temperature: the warmerthe product, the easier to apply. Allow a minimumof two hours for absorption (preferably overnight)and wipe off excess.Used Leather: Clean surface with mild soap andwarm water. Allow to dry. Follow instructions fornew leather. If necessary, apply additional coats.Use only as directed.Not for retail unless authorized.A little goes a long way.So.. with that I left my car to warm up nicely in the sun before applying the product.  My car's interior colors were a mixture of black and light creme leather.  I tested the product on a non-conspicuous leather spot behind my seat, and all was safe.  It didn't change the color.My first impression was the smell. It doesn't smell horrible, but it has a smokey smell to it. Very hard to describe.  When applied the smell is very light and not too apparent, but out of the bottle it has a strong burnt+sour chemical smell to it. I get the impression they were trying to simulate the smell of  natural treated leather.  It will be entirely up to you to decide how compatible this leather is with your product.  In case of my car's interior, I didn't mind it, as I believed the smell would mix right in with that 'new car' smell.  I just wouldn't call it pleasant.Next up-application.  As I applied the Leather Honey onto a clean microfiber cloth, to my surprise it was clear as water, but thick like syrup.  Even though my car was nicely warmed up from the sun, the product laid down thickly.  There was an immediate tackiness as the towel moved across the surface of the leather.  I can see why people say this product isn't oily, because oil is slippery when applied.Still, I will be completely straight with you. Contrary to what other reviewers have stated, the the product IS oily. Very oily, but not in that slippery way.  It leaves the leather glistening.  Even as I turned the towel to wipe off the excess, the leather was glistening. That may be fine for things like shoes, but for car leather, especially dashboards, it's not good.  As instructed, I left the product on the leather to absorb overnight, and on the following day I went over everything again with a dry towel.  Still my leather was left feeling oily, and still glistening.  When I took the car out for a drive, the spot where my elbow normally touches the window sill was very hot to the touch.  As you may or may not know, oily things heat up very quickly (Ever microwave something oily, like a croissant? Yes, it takes only a few seconds).  Anyway, removing my elbow, it left a dull spot!  I took my dry towel and tried to wipe away the dull spot but it didn't go away.  My elbow had pulled the oil right out of the surface of leather.  So yes, this product is very oily, and a terrible choice for car leather.  I also noticed that the smudges left behind on window glass when my towel rubbed up against it (unavoidable), were not easily wiped away.  In fact the only way to get rid of it was to use glass cleaner.Because it is oil based, this product is certainly capable of restoring dry, weathered leather. The downside is that it left my car's leather oily.  I'm sure my leather loved it but but I didn't.  And it leaves a slight tackiness to the leather that I found very unappealing to sit in.Summary:I can see how this product will rock for maintaining shoes and purses, which explains the numerous positive reviews.  But it is not at all a good product on leather which your skin touches on a regular basis. Your skin gives and absorbs oil too, and when it touches something treated with leather honey, it will take away some of that oil.  Leather Honey is very thick and oily.  I laugh now thinking about the recommendation of using a brush in the instructions.  That would have been a nightmare to reduce down to an even layer.  On one hand if you don't put enough on, it won't do any good for the leather. But if you do, it's very, very oily and takes many go-overs to get things to an acceptable state.  And even after that you're left with a tacky, unclean feeling leather.I would not at all recommend this leather product for cars or jackets.  Sorry, as much as I loved the name and the idea behind Leather Honey, I must warn all car lovers to steer away from this product.  I would recommend using Zymol's Leather Creme Conditioner.  It smells better, goes on easy and wipes off without the issues I had with Leather honey.  I ended up using it to restore my interior the way it was before I applied Leather Honey.  I really hoped Leather Honey was a better product than what I was using, but it wasn't--at least not for what I bought it for.Oh yes, I did mention jacket didn't I?  Yes, I applied leather honey to my jacket at the same time.  It was a mistake. It, too, was left feeling slightly tacky.  It was an $800 Levi's Made and Craft leather motorcycle-style jacket (like a baby's butt, sheepskin soft).  Anyway I'm sure with time the tackiness will go away and I'm left with a healthier leather jacket. I won't be doing that that again.Anyway, this has been my honest review of Leather Honey.  I hope it was helpful.  Thanks for reading!If you have any additional tips or suggestions for me, on the product or my review, I'd love to hear it! Leave me a comment. Thanks again!",1333843200,2012-04-08

Not only does it look great, but it also is fully functional as a cutting board or prep surface. It's easy to clean and durable.Originally, I had planned on trying this out in our travel trailer, but after setting it up (attaching the rubber legs), I put it on our stove in the house. My husband liked it so much that it's become a permanent addition to our inside kitchen. If we can find the right size, we'll probably be purchasing an additional one for the travel trailer.The bamboo stove cover has 4 rubber feet which you attach upon receipt of the unit. The unit itself measures 29.5&#34; X 21.25&#34;.  The rubber feet raise the work surface off the stove surface approximately 2&#34;. The front of the work surface has an approximately 1.75&#34; piece of bamboo which hides the burners from view. You need to make sure the burners are completely cool before using this. The groove around the outer portion of the bamboo work surface helps keep juices from overflowing onto the stove. It's easy to clean which is a must if you're using it as a cutting board.The bamboo stove top work surface is light weight, sturdy, and nice looking.

5.0,"At 67 years of age, I can no longer crank a manual trailer jack with any efficiency or quickness.  Even my young, husky and strong nephew wore himself out cranking my sailboat trailer up and down for launching.  After doing some research, I passed up a strongly recommended electric jack selling for just over $250 to purchase this one instead at $205 (and I've seen the same item priced in the $190 range on occasion).  While at a lower price, this unit comes with remarkably better features; stronger, well-lit (it has three LED lights on the head), bearings in the jack screw, very very easy installation (I was impressed with just how easy it was to install) with higher weight-bearing ability. I purchased an optional installation bracket (Universal Mount For Electric Trailer Tongue Jack) from Amazon.com.  Note this bracket is painted, as is the long straight neck of the sailboat trailer. I had to use a wire brush to scrape a little paint in order for the electrical connection to function properly. Note also the bracket is needed in this instance due to the fact a sailboat trailer does not come to an ""A"" at the coupling end, but is long and straight.  Installing the bracket is a 'bolt-on-and-forget' so no worries or issues there. One last thought.  If the electric feature is not working for some reason, using this jack in manual mode is not to be feared.  The crank handle inserts at the top and is turned horizontally, not vertically - so no bending over.  Did I mention I could turn it with one finger!  Unbelievable!  Ball bearings in the jack screw make this possible and I am absolutely DELIGHTED with my purchase...so much so in fact, that I bought two more:  one for my travel trailer and another for my daughter's 27' travel trailer.  I found a waterproof plastic bag in the camping section of Walmart (closes with a strong plastic buckle at the bottom open end) - that fits this jack perfectly and is very inexpensive.  I can't say enough about this jack (its easy install) or the bracket and cover.  Purchase with confidence.  John",1383868800,2013-11-08

It probably would work for most folks immediately, but I put it together wrong from the beginning.  With any electrical device most have positive and negative sides, just as does this gadget.  Right there in front of my eyes, sans reading glasses was a set of arrows telling, no, make that, demanding, that I align each one with the other one.  I did and now you know the rest of the story.  Sorry Paul.I like nifty gadgets like this that have utility, but more gee whiz factors.  The six little LEDs ( I do not recall seeing a large LED ) on each strip are not dim and dull lights.  They are light emitting diodes that put out more light than I imagined.  I originally installed the ZEVO along the read section of our SUV so that it would show up, provide extra light in the back and rattle the minds of the unsuspecting.  As long as I have the sensor within a line of sight to the remote we are all fine.  I try to be careful and NOT run with the red or blue lights on so as not to alert our County Mounties of our presence.  It's hard enough impersonating sanity much less an officer of the law.  I enjoy changing the intensity of the lighting and the on/off functions while changing the light colors.Right now, this is a novelty item for us except for providing additional cabin lighting in the rear of the SUV, but I cannot find an ongoing utilitarian use for it.

5.0,"First, Permatex makes good products.  This is no different.  There are some products labeled similarly but do not contain true silicone in the same way this product does.This is useful for lubricating all sorts of things.  From moving parts you wish to keep lubricated such as door slides and hinges and other hardware such as that.  It will also help to prevent oxidation (rust) from occurring.  It is also very good for applying to plastic and rubber to both keep them with a film of lubricant which you might want on something such as ""rubber"" weatherstripping on the sides of car windows.  It is also good for for using to keep rubber, vinyl and most plastic parts from drying out.This is a product that goes on wet and while it will dry it will not completely evaporate but leave a protective film of silicone which is a good thing.This is not like products such as penetrating oils like Liquid Wrench or WD-40.  Those are good for their purpose but they are lighter lubricants made for penetrating and not leaving the same sort of film as this silicone spray.There are some items that could also be well lubricated with spray lithium grease but this has the advantage of being clear so it does not remain white so it is nice in that sense.The price here right now is significantly more expensive than the local auto parts store.  I would check prices before purchasing.  I love Amazon and sometimes they have the best price and certainly some of the best customer serviceyou will ever find but you do need to check prices as sometimes prices can be much higher (or lower) from place to place.As an aside, contrary to one persons review, this product is NOT an electrical conductor but just the opposite it is an insulator.It is contained in dielectric grease so do not get it on contacts of electronic products!  It can be used carefully on sockets for electronic connections to be used such as dielectric grease but do not get it on the actual metal contact parts themselves.  I tried to post a link to Wiki about silicone that explains this but Amazon does not allow which is why you see the dots in brackets instead.[...]There are other silicone sprays out there, some are also good, some are not.  Be careful to ensure you get what you are after.That is one thing good about Permatex products, they are a trustworthy company and their products are usually one of the best options for their purposes and they have a huge variety of products for very specific uses, most often in automotive products.  So this is a trustworthy brand that you know what you are getting is as described on the label and you are getting what you pay for.

If you can afford the few dollars more than what the K&N; High performance filters are worth, These filters are the real deal. Glass/silicone filter medium is far superior than the paper type! I've been using these filters for my daily drive, they help keep your oil pressure at optimum, they don't slow your oil flow down under heavy acceleration. Checking my oil every 1000km, I have noticed the oil on my stick is noticeably cleaner at the 7,000km mark than it would usually have been with the K&N; filter.Great value for money. Dont buy those crap ones, this will give you peace of mind. keep your oil cleaner for longer :)you will get at lease 10,000kms out of this filter or 7250miles, however the manufacturer also states this filter will last another 50% longer than that at least. WARNING - be careful here, because your oil might not make it that far (unless your using high quality synthetics) and some cars require a certain interval of servicing.using full synthetic oil of a good quality, combined with this filter, and perhaps a washable K&N; or HKS air filter, you could extend your servicing intervals by 5000kms or 2625miles, saving you $$$ and not harming your engine, unless your oil is getting really dirty.",1363478400,2013-03-17

4.0,"I use a lot of Griot's Garage products, but only recently tried Griot's Garage Clay for the first time.  Prior to traying Griot's Garage Clat I have been usingMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Systemon my car for many years.  Overall, Griot's Garage clay did a good job, but I liked working with it less than I like working with Mother's clay.  I will explain the differences below.I am attaching a collage of two photos under customer photos.1) The stock photo is somewhat deceiving as it makes you think the clay fills the nice container it is shipped in. Photo #1 shows the clay in the plastic wrap is it arrived. The amount of clay is sufficient to work with, I am not complaining about that, just the photo makes you think you get a lot more. The container itself is very nice for storage. Mother's clay does not come with a container and I had to come up with a plastic container of my own. A tip on storage: before storing the clay ball in the container wet the outside of the clay ball with Griot's Speed Shine or any other detailing spray. This makes the clay easier to take out the next time as it sticks less to the container.2) Photos #2 shows the 35 oz of Speed Shine which I used as lubricant. Speed shine has almost no scent, provides good cleaning and is easy to work with. Griot's spray trigger  delivers a generous even spray of liquid. Because it is a generous spray the solution is used fairly fast. On the first application of clay I used 1/4 of the bottle. I think I will be able to get 4-5 washes out of this bottle.The clay worked well to remove debris. It took more swipes to remove debris with Griot's clay than with Mother's Clay, but the results were very good. The clay itself is softer and fairly sticky and my hands were slightly yellow when I finished, and there was clay under my nails.  This does not happen when I work with Mother's Clay system.  I was able to remove the residue from my hands using Griot's Speed Shine followed by a vigorous washing with soap.  This made working with the clay less enjoyable.  For example, when the phone rang while I was cleaning my car I could not pick it up because I had clay all over my hands.A tip for short people: I am fairly short so reaching the middle of the roof of my Honda CRV to clay it is difficult. I found that that I can do it if put the clay ball under a triangle-shaped Windshield Reach and Clean ToolStoner 95161 Glass Reach and Clean Tooland use it to rub the clay ball on the parts of the roof I can not reach.  The reason why it works better than other tools is because its surface is concave to follow the windshield shape and that curve holds the clay ball without the ball sliding out.Ali Julia review",1343433600,2012-07-28

However, often, in the final stages of washing, it is tempting to wipe over those last few spots you missed, while washing, and hit them with the drying towel after having dried the car from top to bottom (especially those missed areas at the bottom).I ran the towel through the washing machine twice, with lots of soap, high heat, high agitation, and the dirt/grease marks were hardly removed at all.

4.0,"I've tried this on a couple of items and will update my review accordingly.1. 10 Year Old Camshafts (found in the Back of my garage) - rusted and oilyResults: Submerged for 24 hours and most of the rust and all of oil was gone. I took a Scotch Brite pad to the remaining rust and it came right off.2. Battery Corrosion in Flashlight (three AAA batteries were in a flashlight in my car for two years)Results: I soaked the corroded battery holder (the plastic piece that held the three AAA batteries inside the battery case) for two days and most of the corrosion was gone. This was after I tried using baking soda. A quick hit with a tooth brush sealed the deal. The metal contacts are not perfect, but clean enough that I can use the mini-flashlight after it went unused for at least years! The corrosion inside the aluminum flashlight was fixed with baking soda, but if it was any worse I would have soaked the corroded portion in the solution.Overall, this is a good non-toxic product. The are faster alternatives, but it's safe, reusable and can last for years if you keep it sealed.Next on the testing block will be an old rusted pressure plate from my Nissan Silvia clutch and a bunch of rusted bolts.To be continued....4/14 Update:I filled two Quart containers with oily, rusted bolts that I found around the garage and added Evapo-Rust. After one day, the bolts looked a little better, but nothing amazing. Day two looked better. On day three, you could see a layer of crud building up at the bottom of the containers. I decided this was long enough, so I dumped them in the sink and grabbed a clean rag.The remains of the rust wiped right off most bolts. The rust that was REALLY invasive, didn't come completely off, but I have no doubt another few days would have done it.While you can recycle Evapo-Rust, it was so dirty from the oil and rust remains, I decided to get rid of the used portion. Overall, 98% of the bolts look like new (in addition to a few rusted nut driver bits that I threw in for good measure) so I can't complain. If you are in a rush, you may want to try something else, but I like what I've seen so far.In terms of the chemicals, there was little to no skin irritation on my hands, so that's a big plus!",1396742400,2014-04-06

I fully disagree with the High volume Low pressure that the product claims, as the volume it outputs is actually very low and ""sprinkly"" rather than a good solid ""wall of paint"" like those cheap spray paints in a can.

5.0,"Like all components of the CTEK system the cig socket charger is quality built with o-ring seals in the electrical portion to keep it dry and a firm grip on the socket.  That being said, there are some things to consider.Keep in mind not all cigarette lighter sockets on cars are live 24/7 - most imports tend to kill all outlets when the key is removed while american cars tend to leave the sockets live all the time.  This makes it difficult to use this with EVERY car without leaving the key in the ignition which can in many cases draw more power from the battery than the charger puts in, thus depleating the battery charge.  It's not a win-win scenario.One alternative is to install a second always on cigarette lighter jack for this plug.  If you are going that route I would suggest an alternative which works well with asian and german imports, again from ctek:CTEK 56-380 Comfort Indicator Panel- this is an alternative if your jack is not live without the key turned.  It occupies a blank spot on the dash and performs 2 functions - red/yellow/green blinking leds 24/7 to indicate the battery's state of charge and a ctek input jack to acccept any of their chargers where normally there would be a set of clips, rings, or the -263 cig socket.  Installed properly it looks like a factory install, provides an indication plainly visable, and a rubber covered location for inserting the ctek charger end.  If you can't use this 56-263 easy connect cig socket plug, then the 56-380 is the optimal solution which fits perfectly into a din switch array on imports.Both solutions get you the same result - you have an inside car convenient way to charge your battery from 117 VAC without opening the hood [or the trunk/rear seat/ all the oddball places some cars (ahem bimmer) put their batteries]Both methods are convenient, professional, well made, and part of a system that works well together to keep your car ready to start no matter what battery you use to start it.  The -380 version adds the battery state indicator wihch is a nice bonus at the end of the day to be able to glance at the dash with the key removed and determine the immediate charge status while the -263 (this item) can be used with most any vehicle even riding mowers!",1271030400,2010-04-12

We have never had a problem with the slide, but I don't want to create one either!  We are now planning on a long term trip around the US and felt I should finally get these.  I'm not disappointed.  Others have stated that it stopped, or at least cut down, on the RV shaking.  We have a large family, so I doubt I'll cut down on the movement much.  My primary concern is that we don't cause the slide's functionality to deteriorate.  We have used these jacks now in our driveway, our side yard, and in a state park for a long weekend.  I am very satisfied with how well they work.  They are simple and straightforward.  I don't really know what the long term affect of using vs. not using them would be, but I am convinced that they will help as they are very sturdy and easy to use.

4.0,"The lights are amazingly bright!  These are the ""water proof"" lights so they can go outside as opposed to the others.The kit came neatly packaged and included everything required to install in a car, truck, boat, RV, etc.  However, the directions are just adequate because they look like a photo copy of a photo copy, so the graphics are fuzzy.  You have to use pliers to crimp the power wires to the cigarette lighter adapter that is included with the kit.  When I first hooked it up, it wouldn't work but it did after I took the watch battery out of the remote and re-installed it.  Then everything worked great!  The remote allows you to change from bright white to many different shades of colors and brightness.  Since the remote is infrared, you have to mount the receiver sensor somewhere in line-of-sight for the remote to see it.Installation in a car is pretty simple with the two 1-foot light strips that are included.  Since the controller can handle up to 36 feet of light strips, I'm considering buying some extension light strips to mount under the awning of our RV.  You can get a 5-foot light strip for about $60 or a 10-foot light strip for about $100.  You can also get two 1-foot light strips with a 1-foot extension cable for about $23.  5-foot extension cables run about $11.",1363737600,2013-03-20

5.0,"Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much ""tip toed"" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right.",1345852800,2012-08-25

4.0,"I installed these mirrors (2 qty, as they are sold in single units) on a 2012 Toyota Highlander to help tow a 21' travel trailer. They greatly improve the visibility of the sides of the trailer, though in my case, do not extend away from the vehicle far enough to provide &#34;perfect&#34; visibility. My trailer is 8' wide, and I still have a slight blind spot toward the very rear of the trailer. This may just be par-for-the-course for temporary mirrors, however. The mirrors attach easily, though it took some trial-and-error, as the directions are quite minimalist. Note that to properly tighten the straps, you ratchet them with a little lever/handle on the straps before closing the lock shut. The mirrors themselves are very difficult to tilt the way you want them, but that's a double-edged sword, as you don't want them jiggling out of place when going down the road.

If your wheels or aluminum parts are in really good shape, the Billet Polish will give them a mirror finish, the Mag and Aluminum Polish will probably slightly dull the finish. If the wheels or aluminum parts have lost their shine then I would recommend the Mag and Aluminum Polish. There is a big difference between the two but not detailed enough on Mother's website.",1370304000,2013-06-04
4.0,"This scanner is really a handy device for your average garage mechanic.  This has already helped me by saving a lot of extra time troubleshooting.  Above that, it gives a level of detail that basic scanners can't even come close to duplicating.  It seems a lot of thought has been put into this scanner.  The cable is long enough so that you can read it from the engine compartment if you wanted to.  It has the ability to record data as you're driving.  It can save codes, and allows you to assign them to specific VIN's (for viewing later on your computer).  There's a lot more you can do with it too, if you're willing to pay for extra options.  The only issue I have is they try to get you to sign up for some monthly fee to research the codes you pull.  I don't feel its needed, I haven't signed up for it, and I think it should be a free service (for the cost of the device).  The scanner gives more than enough info, and if you need more detail, Google does a great job of that... for free.  Even with that, I'd still recommend it to any garage mechanic looking to upgrade their scanner tool.",1384128000,2013-11-11

Do not give into temptation and cut the plastic piece between bumper and grill - trust me - it will work.  It's a pain to mount but it does work.Now, for the bad.  I bought this because it was a &#34;Mopar&#34; product.  It showed up in a box with a Mopar sticker over another sticker.

5.0,"I bought this to use on my son's 1997 black Honda Accord. Although I've maintained the car well and it has no rust, there are enough small scratches on the hood from rocks over the years to mar the color.This product requires some work. You have to wash the card first, naturally. Then you apply the pre-finish, which you remove with the detailing spray. After this step alone the car looks 100% better.After the pre-finish, apply the wax. Be careful, it's a thin consistency and will spill and leave black stains on a light surface, such as a garage floor. Try and keep the car in the shade or work on it (carefully) in the garage. It's much easier to work on a cool surface. Also, just a word of caution, wear latex or vinyl gloves if you can to prevent the black wax and pre-finish from getting on your skin and under your nails.When the car was done it shined very nicely with a beautiful black sheen that masked a multitude of scratches. The 15-year old car looked just great.I can speak to durability yet and I'm tempted to put a coat of conventional clear wax on top of the black wax.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to enhance the look of their black car.

5.0,These towels are perfect for drying your car / truck after washing it. They are soft and very absorbent. I own a Ford F150 and I can easily dry the entire truck with one towel. In the past I would use old bath towels to dry it with but they would often leave fibers behind. These towels will not leave any fibers or water droplets behind on the surface. Each towel measures 16 x 27 which seems to be a good size. It's large enough to dry your entire vehicle but not as large as a bath towel.They also work really well for detailing rims but I wouldn't suggest cleaning your tires with them because the black from the tires is a little difficult to wash out. Apply some Windex and they work very well to clean your windows as well.You get a dozen towels when you order from Amazon and the price is very reasonable in my opinion. Purchasing similar towels locally might very well cost you three or four times as much.,1303084800,2011-04-18

5.0,"I wanted to explain how I decided to purchase this Jump-n-Pack so my review is long Sorry!I have used many Jump Packs & all have worked OK in the past until I purchased a Larger Diesel Truck that is. This truck is a Mitsubishi FE140 with a 4Cyl Turbo Diesel engine. It has two Batteries & we have two inverters, a fridge etc that run of the truck.One day we was shopping but when we returned to the truck no start because we left lights on OOPs. Now the store we were at had a normal Name Brand Jump Pack like you see in most stores. Unfortunately it didn't work at all.So we called roadside Assistance which was to say the least an adventure.1. After over two hours of waiting & mis-communications a nice guy in a Honda that was barely running showed up. I was literally laughing as he pulled up with his little yellow light on the roof. His car was barely running. All he had was a smaller Clore Jump-n-Carry which didn't do any better than the other one we tried earlier. He gave up eventually2. Roadside Assistance Apologized & said they would send a more appropriate vendor to jump our truck.3. Next a truck larger than ours showed up so now Im thinking we are in good hands. Well he had a direct connection plug to use his truck to jump us which did work but not before trying for 30 minutes.So after all this my BoyScout side said I would never be left in this situation again so I researched many Jump Packs on the web. Finally finding the Clore JNC660 which had a few reviews about it jumping even Larger Tractors which have multiple batteries. I decided I had nothing to loose so I purchased it during a Xmas Lightning deal thinking how is this Jump Pack going to work on our truck being this inexpensive. I purchased knowing Amazon would back it up & also thinking I could use it on our boat if nothing else.I also made sure I was getting the newer model based on some reviews saying they didn't receive the updated model. At first all seemed well so I didn't get to test it out since I wasn't going to run batteries down purposely. Finally there was a day it happened the truck didn't start because something ran the batteries down. So I pulled the Jump-n-Pack out thinking I hope this works.First of all it had nice long reach cables which was awesome since all others I have owned or tried had very short cables that required holding the jump pack up over batteries. Next I hooked it up went to cab tried to start & it fired up almost instantly to my amazement.I have now had to use the Jump-n-Pack multiple times on this truck because the Fridge was running batteries down very fast due to defect. The Jump-n-Pack has not failed one time & has had to jump this truck not only once on a charge but 4 times in same day.I know it is It is just a simple Jump Pack but it does the job so well all my vehicles will have one soon.Update 08/19/2013:I have been using this for quite awhile now & it has never let me down yet. I have used it to boost my Fuso Turbo Diesel truck multiple times, Our Land Rover, Lawn Mower as well as our Boat. I will purchase a backup second one when Amazon puts it on sale again.Now there is one negative to mention. After using it quite a few times I have noticed the cables getting skinned from the way it winds them up. I have found you must take extra care to wind it up just right to prevent this from happening.Update 09/12/2013Today Amazon put this on sale again so true to my word I have purchased a second one.I also wanted to add to my review I recently had to replace both batteries on my Truck because they both had dead cells. This is even more testament to this Jumper because it was still able to get my truck running even with two bad batteries that were low on water also.",1372636800,2013-07-01

5.0,"The Amazon description says it holds six quarts.  The stamped information on the bottom of mine says seven quarts.  From experience, I'd say it holds well over 6 but not quite 7 quarts.The cap seals nice and tight -- I have no worries about putting it in my trunk (full of oil) to tote it to Pep Boys for oil disposal.  (Although I wrap it in a trash bag just in case.)The funnel attaches well and stores away easily, even with oily hands.  There's a kind of a four-sided grate over the funnel hole that may stand a chance of catching a washer or drain bolt before it falls in.  The grate can also be used to tighten and twist off the funnel.It's made of thick, strong plastic that seems as if will last for a very long time.  It is extremely low to the ground, and fits easily both under my Honda and my riding mower.For those people who think the funnel is too small -- I don't share the concern.  If your car's drain bolt is more than a foot or so higher than the funnel, perhaps you need to sit the container on a cinder block or something to raise it.  Part of my oil change toolkit is a chain like the kind you find on pens at the bank (see attached link).  I use it like a plumb line to ensure that the funnel is well under the drain bolt.MMF Industries Secure-A-Pen Ballpoint Counter Pen with Base, Black Ink, Medium (28904)",1344124800,2012-08-05

4.0,"Firstly, Gabriel Ricci's review is spot on, I did similar exhaustive review and read up of all the aftermarket replacement bulbs (DRLs and High Beams) for Honda Pilot 2011. These came closest without going the expensive, warranty voiding HID conversion or other brand bulbs like Syl and PIAA etc. also Philips reputation and several owners' experience counted  in the decision. The vendor Morex shipped it fast. Now if you know what you are buying into and have expectations accordingly, these bulbs are awesome, they are brighter than factory OEM bulbs ( Sylvania and  Osram), little hint of blue, still remains in the yellow , near white spectrum, maybe about 3800 to 4000 kelvin. These are nowhere near HID nor meant to be. Neither they are the Gaudy, bluish color that some of the other bulbs look. These preserve or enhance the intensity of the OEM while improving about 25% light output, which in turn is very effective during night driving. Cannot comment on the longevity as they have been in use just a few hours now... Will update after 6 months or earlier if there are any life related issues. BTW, installation on a Pilot is a real PITA given the tight working room to access these lights. Need good amount of finger dexterity to get the job done. Driver's side is more difficult, but not undo able with some patience, nothing to be removed like air filter intake etc. wear thin working gloves and ensure no dirt, smudges on the bulb during installation.",1377302400,2013-08-24

4.0,"I too am an automotive detailer, I've used this product for quite some time.  It used to be called all wheel cleaner but is not called all wheel and tire cleaner.I don't get the negative reviews,  this product works great for many applications.  Applications as in, wheels, tires, and even plastic wheel wells where gritty dirt accumulates.Wet the wheel down, make sure it's cold, you don't want to apply this or anything for that matter to an extremely hot surface.. Work one wheel at a time, rinse, apply product, let sit a few seconds SCRUB the tire and wheel with a SOFT to MODERATE bristle brush, and rinse away... You shouldn't have a problem and you should see a dramatic improvement.Cons:  this stuff isn't cheap and it doesn't last for more than about 3 sets of 4 tires and wheels.  Use it only when completely necessary.  If you wash your car often DON'T use this all of the time unless your budget is better than mine.  Use your car wash detergent or even dawn dish soap along with the above described method of application removal.

5.0,"Pennzoil Ultra is the company's top of the line motor oil.  Shell, parent company of Pennzoil, engineered this 5w-40 European Full Synthetic product to meet the tough European Specifications.  Indeed, you would be hard pressed to find a common late model gasoline European vehicle that is not covered by this product (always double check though).Its approvals include Mercedes-Benz 229.5, BMW LL-01, Porsche A40, Ferrari, Maserati, Fiat, VW 505.00, and VW 502.00.These specifications all speak to the quality of the product. In particular, Mercedes-Benz 229.5 (used in the majority of gasoline engine Mercedes cars the past decade) is particularly tough to meet.In normal operating conditions, when you have a European vehicle, an approved oil allows you to comfortably run the full oil change interval recommended by your manufacturer.  Some of these European manufacturers have very long oil change intervals, which is why the correct oil with a strong additive package is so very important.Due to licensing, very few products meet current Ferrari specifications in North America.  This is about your only choice if you have a Ferrari in North America (you must be very happy if you have that Ferrari), and that specification sets this product apart from its rival European products from Mobil and Castrol which do not meet Ferrari spec.  The technical specs are all impressive.  This product has a very low NOACK volatility and proper viscosity for the majority of European vehicles in most climates.This is a highly recommended product. Depending on price and your personal preferences, Mobil 1 0w-40 is another terrific option that meets most of the same specifications besides Ferrari, Maserati, and Fiat.",1391385600,2014-02-03

5.0,"When I purchased my last FF helmet, I decided to try a quick-release clip, mostly because I was tired of fumbling around with D-rings while wearing gloves.I bought the PowerMadd speed-clips and was very impressed at how quickly and easily they attached, AND how well they work.  Since I have more than one helmet, I decided to purchase speed-clips for all of them.  These Raider brand clips are exactly the same as PowerMadd, right down to the injection mold marks, and cost less!Installation is easy, connect either the square or round clip through the webbing that holds the D-rings, or capture behind the D-rings (if they are sewn to the strap).  Clip the square or round clip into the receiver and that side is done!  The other side is simply a matter of threading the strap through the ""grip-clips"".Most people complain that these cannot be used if you have the little ""snap"" on your strap (which keeps the excess strap from flapping in the wind)... THIS IS NOT TRUE, but you DO have to cut your strap to REMOVE the snap from the end... you won't need it anymore anyway, so go ahead and cut it off... use good sharp scissors, make a round or angle cut, and burn the edges with a lighter to melt the nylon and keep it from fraying.UPDATE:I've been using these Quick Release Clips on my helmets now for over a year, without one issue to report.  I've recently added helmets (different styles and sizes) to replace/upgrade for myself and other family members, and just ordered several more of these Quick Release Clips... you can't beat the comfort and ability to quickly secure your chin-strap (and release it with one finger).

5.0,"What is it? : Simply put it is a peripheral for your car that reads data that your car is already capturing.  The read data is then sent to your smart phone and helps you become a more efficient driver.  Simultaneously it helps you analyze issues with your car and correct them as necessary.How does it work?:  You take the device and plug it into your cars OBD II port.  OBD stands for on board diagnostics.  The port is usually found under the dash on the drivers side (depending on vehicle).  You also need the FREE application from Automatic for your smartphone.  We used an iPhone 5 in our testing.  The device connects to your car and then your smartphone using Bluetooth after which the application takes over and monitors your car and your driving habits.  ** You can move the device between different cars and have the application remember your vehicles.What does it do, exactly? :  The Automatic will monitor your driving habits such as speed, quick acceleration, hard braking, etc...  It will also monitor codes from your car for problems...and simultaneously tell you what the codes mean and what you need repaired (ie. pesky check engine lights, etc).  The device also has audible alerts for when you drive at 70mph, brake hard, and or accelerate too quickly.  The audible alerts are small beep patterns that are emitted from the device and just quick warnings...nothing too loud or obtrusive.  It just helps you to understand your driving habits and maybe adjust them for more fuel economy.  While all of this is happening, the application on your smartphone is collecting this data via bluetooth so it can give you a report on your driving.  The application and the device are supposed to track when you fill up at the gas station (supported on some cars as per their site).....; we have not tested this as of yet.How did you test it and what cars did you try?:  I have only had it for 2 days now and we tested in the following vehicles: 2006 Acura MDX, and a 2009 Altima Hybrid.  We plugged it in, paired it to the phone, and setup our vehicle (takes 1-2 minutes).  We then naturally went on some drives and fortunately enough they involved some highway driving (speed limit 65mph).  I am also fortunate in that I have a 16.5yr old son who is learning to drive and a bit over confident in his skills.  We went out on our first journey and once on the highway, my son hit 70....the Automatic let our an audible beep that alerted the kid that he was at 70mph....he slowed down.  The car we used for our first set of testing was our Acura MDX with about 6 passengers...so it was a bit heavy.  When we got off of the highway at what was a short exit ramp, he ended up having to brake a bit hard...the Automatic alerted him to that.  (PS...the app does tell you what alerts mean what...with sample sounds). That was day one...the app for some reason did not keep a record of that drive and that does concern me somewhat; I feel that it is an error on my part and not the device.I personally think this is a great way to learn how to drive efficiently and to get information from your car that already exists  (yes, our cars have black boxes;;lol).  Also, since we have a youngster that is beginning to drive, this device makes it easy for him to know when he is wrong and when he is driving correctly.  While it will not fix habits for established drivers, it will alert you to things you can change.I feel this is an excellent product and has a huge potential going forward.  So far I love it and I have no hesitation in recommending it.  I do recommend that you check if it is compatible with your vehicles before you buy.5/5 stars for us.UPDATE 10/30/13:  I have been using this device for a few days now and am even more impressed with it then I was before.  Here is what I learned:1. You must have your smartphone in the car with the application running in the background for the smart processing to provide you information about your driving.  It actually calculates your $$$ spent on gas and notifies you of how many hard accelerations, braking's, etc.2. Today it came up and prompted me to add 3 contacts that it could notify in case of a severe crash.  I did...it accessed the contacts on my iPhone.  One piece of advice..make sure those people are aware you are going to add them; they will get a text message (my wife got a text and panicked, until I explained the situation).  This will actually send messages to 3 of those people if you, god forbid, are in a severe crash.  Naturally you must have cell coverage when that happens and an undamaged phone.3.  The device will run and operate without the smartphone application and continue to provide the driver audible alerts for speeds at 70mph, hard braking, and hard acceleration.  It just cannot track your driving on the application...this is a PLUS point as anyone can use the car and feel a bit smarter about driving habits.So far so good....more to come in the days ahead, I am sure.  IMPRESSED!",1382918400,2013-10-28
3.0,I have a 2014 Tundra. The receiver is good heavy solid metal. It has a nice smooth finish on it. It fits in my 2 inch receiver with no problem at all. The bad is the Shackle was a pain to unscrew the pin. It looks like they painted the shackle and then the pin and then put it together while the pain was still wet. Also the threads are a little off. Not to the point it doesn't turn but it takes you to get you man hands on to turn the pin. The pain on there looks like some cheap generic paint they dipped it in. Not like the receiver which is power coated. Now the UGLY.... looking at the shackle i really question if it will hold together. It looks like it broke during casting and they JB wield it together and put the cheap crappy paint on it. So i dont regret buying it but i would suggest getting some extra Shackles.,1392595200,2014-02-17

Particularly since it continues to beep at you as you drive. But features like helping you get back to your car without having to remember to mark a parking location and info on engine warnings are particularly useful.However, I wish it would work without having to have your phone always paired and online. I don't have an always-on data plan so have to use my hot spot if I want to use the device while driving.

The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot.

5.0,"I bought several different LED 1141 replacement lights to test out for our recently acquired travel trailer.  After reading about how much less energy the LED's use than the incandescent 1141's I was convinced the switch would be worth it, despite the relatively high cost.  We do a lot of dry camping (no shore power) and I don't want to have to think too much about always turning lights on and off to conserve battery power.  Plus I think (hope!) that the LED bulbs will last a lot longer than the incandescents, two of which burned out in the first two weeks of owning the trailer.Anyways, first I tried these:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BN5ZT0/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00Despite saying ""warm white"" these are actually a very bright white, probably 1.5x as bright as the incandescent 1141's they replaced and a very clean white light.  If super-bright and clean light is what you want these will do it.  For me, though, they robbed some of the ""cozy"" feeling I like when having dinner or playing cards in the trailer at night, so I installed them in the main overhead light, which I usually only turn on when I'm looking for something.Next I tried these:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TKI4VU/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00These were a warmer white but they were probably only 50% of the brightness of the incandescents they replaced.  They didn't give off enough light that we could comfortably play cards by these alone at the dinette, so I knew these weren't going to be good for my needs.  Because they're such low-light I'll probably just use them as replacements for the exterior lights on the trailer or something.These new lights (the ones this review is for) are pretty much perfect.  They're slightly brighter than the 1141's and not quite as ""warm"" but they're definitely close enough on both accounts that you'd only really notice the difference if you saw them side-by-side in a fixture or you're especially sensitive to lights in some way.  So if you're looking for a ""good as it gets"" replacement for your old 1141's in an RV benefit from my testing and get these, because they're more or less dead on.",1349136000,2012-10-02

5.0,"It's worth understanding that unlike typical ratcheting straps, the handle has two ""rest"" positions.  One of the jobs of the red tab is to jump the handle from one position to the other.  In one position, the device works like a seat belt retractor, with the strap able to pay out or self-retract, just like seatbelts in a car.In the other position, the handle works like a typical ratcheting strap system.  HOWEVER, even in this position, realize that these straps are made of seatbelt material, which is kind of slick, so the wound up material will slip over itself on the spool quite a bit before you get maximum belt tension.When you ratchet the belt down, keep tightening until all this ""slip"" or ""slack"" is pulled out.  Then tighten it some more for good measure!  And most importantly, when you're done tensioning, DO NOT return the handle to the ""seat belt retractor mode"" position, or you can lose tension all together.  With normal ratchets, you're probably used to returning the handle all the way back down flat prior to hauling.  On this product, that's bad, because putting the handle all the way down flat is the ""retractor mode"" position!  You'll need to leave the handle slightly up for ""locking-ratcheting mode"".  It will look funny, but it is the position it needs to be in.I can see a situation, in some applications, where the hustle and bustle of freight handling can cause the lever to be unintentionally whacked down flat into the ""retractor mode"" position, which may cause the belt to go slack.  That is a risk.  For my application, these are wonderful, and greatly simplify tidying up your straps.",1403395200,2014-06-22

So later we went camping at my favorite spot in the desert and after placing the yamaha 30 feet from trailer where I would put the Honda I noticed the Yamaha was louder. With The Honda I could barely hear it when im in the trailer but the Yamaha was not as quit and I could easily hear it running. I was hoping it would be the same but because it's louder Im not happy at all so I sold the Yamaha and now looking to get another Honda...but dang it...

5.0,"I spent several weeks trying to decide if i wanted to invest in a brake controller for our new-to-us travel trailer. Since i grew up on a farm, trailers are nothing new to me but brake controllers are. I am pulling a 26' bumper-to-bumper trailer with a 2006 Yukon Denali XL and the 400 miles that I have pulled it have been without issue. However, there was one time that I wished that I had more stopping power and the trailer seemed like a load for the Yukon's brakes,so I started researching brake controllers. First I looked at a middle of the road option from Wal-Mart, but then I ran across this one for $40 more. Somewhere in the reviews a person mentions the cost of not having one, and he/she could not be more right. $20,000.00 SUV, $4,000.00 trailer (weekend warriors), and my priceless family and family pets....and I had to think for two weeks about spending $100.00???I ordered the brake controller and the proper wiring harness from Amazon and had it in two days thanks to my prime membership. With the $10 wiring harness for the Yukon, I was able to install the controller in 20 minutes...no joke. No splicing...no fuse manipulation..no electrical tape...just plug-n-play. Also to my surprise the Yukon had two pre-drilled holes in metal directly under the steering column that fit the brake controller mounting bracket perfectly. Now for a test run.I hooked the trailer up and the controller immediately detected it so I took off slowly down my driveway. While I did look at the brakes when I purchased the trailer (I am pretty sure the previous owner never used them), I had no way of testing the overall system so my first test was to see if the trailer brake system actually worked. It did. In fact, the boost was set on 2 and the wheels locked up with little effort. I tried no boost and then settled on boost 1. I can see where the options of no boost, boost 1, and boost 2 will be nice when going through the mountains.Anyhow, the final test, I took off down the road and not 3 miles from house some yahoo decided to pass me on a two lane road at the crest of a hill and forced me into a situation where I had to put the brakes to the floor. In that instant the trailer brakes locked and stopped the Yukon, not the other way around, and every ounce of buyers remorse was gone just as quickly.Give yourself some piece of mind while saving the brakes on your towing rig. Buy it and grab a wiring harness while you are at it.",1360195200,2013-02-07

5.0,"I had doubts on this product due to the cost but boy was I wrong, this product is great. Quality of the pads are surprising soft and well made. I've seen quite a few reviews saying it not reusable, this is not true! Perhaps due to the cheap cost majority of the people think of it as a disposable solution to their microfiber pads but what you really need to do is leave it soaked over night in a bucket with hot water and detergent, rinse a few times and place it into a washing machine. Comes out brand new looking again to reuse. Having this in mind you can now go through pads so they don't get completely soaked with wax solutions.",1381708800,2013-10-14

I did the old elbow grease job.I didn't think my battery powered drill would hold-up and I didn't wanna mess with a cord. The ball knocks the job out quick with my electric drill and when I get done with my Harley it gives me more time to ride and let momma luv on me from behind.The thing should last forever and the red makes it easy to spot by an old man.buy one or two and quit thinking stupid like I was.,1396569600,2014-04-04

4.0,"Once on these mirrors remained snug and in place for 14 hours of driving with no problems.  The mirrors have a snug adjustment, but that's a good thing becuase they don't bounce around very much while going down the road.  Some towing mirrors really vibrate while you're traveling and that can be pretty annoying after awhile.There are 4 peices to each mirror.  The mirror itself, the wedge bar to hold the mirror in place, and the bolt that applies pressure to the wedge to make sure the mirror doesn't move while driving down the road.  There's also a peice of stick on felt for the wedge bar so it doesn't rub your mirror.I had 2 problems with the design.1) The set srew that you turn to apply presure and hold the mirror in place was fine on the one mirror, but on the other mirror there was some much resistance when turning it that I thought I was going to snap the turn handle off.  After several slow attempts with some WD40 applied, it finally turned all the way in.  After a couple of installations the bolt has loosened a little and seems to be fine now.2) Wedge bar felt strip requires trimming, so it isn't cut to fit out of the box.  While this is a minor thing, it's still kind of a pain.  The other problem is that the wedge bar is loose when the mirrors aren't in use, so if you aren't careful you could loose the wedge and then the mirror would be useless.  The bolts stay in just fine due to friction, but I don't like having loose unattached peices on something like this becasue it never fails that at some point one of them will go missing and will probably happen while on the road.Overall these mirrors work well, I just wish they were designed a little differently.",1403654400,2014-06-25

I am glad I switched since these are very bright and have a great &#34;white&#34; beam appearance.  The price is very reasonable knowing there are more expensive options I stuck with these.

It was on clearance for $5.99 at an auto parts store, clearly marked down in error.Let me start by saying I keep my SUV immaculate, so I know if a product truly works or not, and this does!!!After washing I leaving it wet and go to town with a QUALITY damp microfiber, spraying a panel at a time and wiping. No more big clumsy towels or absorber nonsense, simple 16x16 towel works well. This spray wax gives that just waxed POP we all love. I follow up my drying with a dry mircofiber to buff..Cons:You vehicle MUST be cool, after washing get it put of the sun.

5.0,"I researched all available plastic polishing products in some depth because I wanted to find a product that is suitable for polishing out some scratches on acrylic plastic aircraft windows (these require cleaning/polishing products without ammonia).After lots of reviews I decided to give the Novus product a try, mainly because it can be applied without a mechanical buffer and it does no require wetting the plastic object with water like some of the other products (bound to make a mess when working on an aircraft window from inside the cabin).I followed the instructions and was amazed that the #2 polish was able to flatten/remove a scratch that was noticeable by moving a finger nail over it. It took me about 15 minutes before the scratch was almost gone/invisible. I will finish this with #1 polish and am sure this will be very satisfactory.I was able to completely eliminate several light scratches on the inside of my windshield (caused by head seat placed on top of instrument panel).The Novus polish is liquid, but does not drip/run, hence it is very easy to work on vertical surfaces,such as windows in place.All in all : a great product at a very reasonable price",1342051200,2012-07-12
4.0,"Love the smell and color of the soap, to start with. I purchased the smaller size, to test and see how the soap was (I generally buy small then big).The smell is similar to bubblegum, and the color is as well. Although it's supposed to be super concentrated, I find that Meguiars Gold Class soap was similar in terms of foam output. Although I still need to purchase a foam lance to confirm that fact, I believe that's the case.Anyway, I end up using half a capful to a small bucket of water, for washing a medium size sedan. Sometimes more, as the foam doesn't last for long.Overall, I like the soap but the value for the small size isn't there, a gallon size is necessary. Otherwise just stick with Meg's Gold Class.",1399161600,2014-05-04

It's hard not to get overspray on you wheels, however, and you will need to clean them afterwards.  This stuff smells like bug spray, but with just one application, my tires looked great.  The letters on the tire looked 3D.  I didn't want to overdo the shine, so I stopped at just one application, but the manufacture says your can do a second application right after the first coat drys.  However, after a month I could't resist one more application.  I think the can will do four or more applications, which I plan to do from time to time.  Makes your tires look brand spanking new.

I leave mine on shower, because I use the hose most often to wash my dog.  The mist setting is very fine.  Jet is strong.  My least favorite is soaker, which resembles a broken fire hydrant.I like this nozzle.  I had moved my hoses around and lost track of my other one, so I was glad to have another one to replace it.

5.0,"I purposely tried to run these little guys through the ringer when testings. I hold true that if they can handle abuse that I'm bound to give in my pre-camping testing they should hold up pretty good for some time to come.I marked a couple of these and made sure that I abused the marked ones as much as possible over a couple days. Over tightening them, yanking on them, stepped on, used a sling shot to hurl them at a telephone pole, also clamped them onto a piece of canvas and then hung as many as 4 bricks from them for the day. You know the excessive abuse level, lol. Not only do they hold up a tarp or whatever you want to fit in their jaws well they also held up pretty well with all the abuse that I gave them. Before I go on camping trips I like to make sure that my gear isn't going to crumble just because it gets banged around or you fall off the side of a small cliff and still want to setup shelter. These are important periods in camping and it's nice to know you have something reliable to work with.So I like to punish test gear well before any trips.Granted I did have one of the test clips brake on me but that was after an excessive amount of abuse and well after I thought it should have broken. It happened when I  fired it out of the sling shot for the 5th time, with a pretty substantial pull back. I know my method of testing sounds odd or off to you but like I said, if it can handle extreme abuse it can handle simple applications. Also note that they will bend fairly easy and the ""tail"" is the weak point of the system. So be sure when storing them that nothing is putting pressure on them from the side or that nothing could.One thing I did notice is that over tightening them to the extreme will start to cause some damage to the tightening mechanism, if your's start to show a white line around the base of the screw inside the ""jaw"", then you can pretty much kiss that one goodbye. That's a weakening of the material and I experienced that with one of the text units but that was only after excessive tightening (used a pair of pliers to tighten them down).So far, these have passed my test and I would recommend them, they do have some flex to them but it seems to be just the right amount and the plastics used seem to be pretty sturdy. I gave the remaining shark clips to my father to use when he takes his RV out so he can easily extend his tarps over the side. He seems pleased and he enjoyed watching me test these out, he even contributed to some of these ideas.",1336608000,2012-05-10

As such, I may not have a lot of information to add, except for the fact that I've had this nozzle for at least five years.  I'm not sure exactly when I bought it, but it was definitely no later than 2009.I've used it consistently over that time, for washing the car, hosing off the patio by the pool, washing the dog, cleaning the pool filter, etc etc. It's heavy-duty enough to drop on the concrete, it just lands with a dull thud from that thick rubber ring around the end, and years of abuse haven't affected it in the slightest.  The stream selection by rotating the outer ring is still as smooth as the day I bought it.Being able to turn it off at either end of the rotation is a nice feature too, less messing with it when you're done using it. I had intended to buy another one for the hose in the back of the house, but instead I've just been switching this one back and forth as necessary.If you're looking through these reviews because you're interested in buying one (why else would you be?), get one.  It's worth the money.",1399593600,2014-05-09

5.0,"First...... follow the directions and bleed the pump.  Very simple.  Open the bleed valve on the top of the pump and open the pump valve by turning the handle to the open position(in other words the pump wont lift). Now,hand pump the jack several times very fast and then tighten the screw back down on the top of the pump housing.  DONE.  Easy enough.  Now attempt to jack up one corner of the car.  No, not a thirty ton tank.  It's only a 1.5 ton lifting jack.  Jack should lift the car or item very easily.  Use jack stands after you have finished lifting the car into position.  Better safe than sorry.  Never rely on just a pump jack, always put stand(s) under what your working under!! That's just common senseAs for the pump leaking.  well i've found that most guys try to lift something too heavy and blow out the gaskets and that's why they find the pump broken down the road a week later or after a few uses.  Get a bigger lift if you need to lift more weight!  A few bucks spent now saves more in the end!I live in a cold climate i even used the jack in a freezer where the temperature was 26 degrees.  No problems there either.  So, why so many complaints? Hmmmmm, my guess faulty or just trying to lift the heavy stuff and figure it's the pumps fault.  Amazon has an excellent return policy and Torin is helpful. I now own three of these jacks and couldn't be happier.Works well under a Camaro SS 2011 650 hp....  Even under a 25hp John Deere riding Mower..... happy lifting my friends!!!Update............  Still going strong and using daily! February 9,2013",1348099200,2012-09-20

3.0,"With the exception of Invisible Glass, that is the ONLY Stoner product that deserves 5 stars.  I bought this for cleaning the inside glass of my car for the front and rear windshield.  It really provided no better results than if I had twisted and contorted my body and used a decent microfiber cloth.  Sure, it makes the cleaning task easier, but not streak free.The main problem is the bonnets that it comes with are not best suited for cleaning glass; the pack only comes with one true microfiber bonnet.  The rest are geared for other purposes and the others they allege for cleaning glass (not the right type of microfiber for the job).  They are also way too tight a fit around the triangular head which causes it to bow, so unless you apply enough pressure you will have an unevenly smeared, sloppy cleaned surface.This is a good concept, but marketed with too much hype.  Visit the Stoner website and view consumer reviews on ANY of their products and you will see only positive reviews.  They are one of those companies that filter out negativity and only post the positive consumer reviews.  I'll use it for only the purpose I mentioned above but for the most part it will sit in a closet with little use.",1396828800,2014-04-07

There are definitely cheaper ones out there, but I can't comment on those because I've never seen them in person.  I liked the look of these because of the fabric between the velcro straps -- it looks like they would do a better job resisting the tendency for the straps to slide toward each other when the handle is pulled on.I bought these handles along with theRugged Ridge 13305.14 Pillar Rear Side Grab Handles, which are an equally good solution for the rear seats.",1289779200,2010-11-15

1.0,"After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the ""frequently bought together deal"" including the 6.5"" finishing pad and the 6.5"" polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7"" which include a recess to make centering the polisher's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7"" pads are actually machine washable.  The Velcro pad is attached far more securely.  The older 6.5"" pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0""  or this older 6.5"" pad, it's just that Meguiar's has improved and updated their pads now.  The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad, that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0"" pad a no-brainer.

4.0,"It rains a lot in New Orleans. Umbrellas are as much accessories as purses or wallets. Sometimes the sky opens up and rain falls in sheets, like driving through a car wash. Down here we need really good windshield wipers. But it's not always clean, we live in the mud and swamp and that splashes up on the car and the windshield, and then of course bugs commit caricide and birds crap and the windshield takes it all while we try to see out of it and not get killed by our fellow New Orleans drivers.The Bosch blades were easy to install. We drive a 2011 scion xb and needed the 22B and the 20B. Ordering is easy, Put Bosch icon wiper blades in the amazon search and just pick anyone, then a screen will come up on the page telling you to make sure this is the right size blade. The page has a menu and you click the make, model, and year of your car and it will tell you exactly what you need and you can go to the right page for the size of wipers for your vehicle.After Jim installed the wipers we had a huge rainstorm and they kept the windshield clear while he drove to work. We also had one of those on and off sprinkles where we had to use the intermittent wiper setting and the icons did a good job of not stuttering and skipping over the windshield. They also did a good job when we sprayed the wiper fluid up and used the wipers to get dirt and gunk off. They didn't get the dried bird poop off but we haven't a wiper yet that does completely.I will update about how long they lasted, we do not garage our cars and so the blades are exposed to rain, sun, humidity, and heat- the usual New Orleans climate.",1328486400,2012-02-06

4.0,"As many have said, this pretty much takes the place of the more time consuming, difficult processes of claying and other types of waxing.  You do need to wash and thoroughly clean the car before using this.  The bottle says this, but they should highlight it a bit more; you don't wanna use this if there is any grit on the car at all, or you may scratch the paint.Anyway, the directions read like a normal wax; apply, wax on, turn over the towel, then wax off.  But in practice, this wasn't required; rather, after spraying on, it only needed to be waxed on; the same microfiber towel seemed to simply polish it right in (like the paint was absorbing it).  I didn't have to turn the towel over.  Maybe I wasn't using enough, but it seemed to work; definitely improved the shine.  I've yet to see how water &#34;phobic&#34; it is, as it hasn't rained yet, but I'm hoping it will be very much so.The only downside to this product vs other types of wax, is that the nature of being a wide spray nozzle means some of it is going to go places you don't intend it to... like on glass...  the windshield, lights, plastic parts, your clothes, etc.  So, just be careful with it.  Overall, seems like a great product when used after washing.Be sure you have a microfiber towel; regular towels really don't work well with car cleaning; they seem to just remove wax.",1400544000,2014-05-20

4.0,"Summary: Ideal for storage, the automatic modes are good for less technical people, but do limit what you can do.  Definitely not a ""High power"" charger.As a ""Smart"" charger, you just hook it up to the battery, plug it into the wall and push a single button - the onboard logic figures out what you need and does the rest.  It will tell you if you've put the terminals on backwards, it will decide if it's a 6VV or 12V battery, and then starts to charge.  This makes it very simple, but won't let you try and resurrect 12V batteries which are below 8V.The charger itself is a nice size - fairly small and comes with a detachable plastic hook so you can hang it on your car or motorcycle when charging.  It comes with alligator clips or a direct hook up so you can use the speed connector.I wasn't able to find a current rating in the literature but looking at the back it's rated for 60 watts.  This suggests that it will charge your battery at perhaps 4-5 amps.  That's an overnight charge at best.  When I was a kid we used to have a 20 amp charger that could bring a dead battery back to enough charge to start your car within an hour or two.  Other chargers have a ""start"" mode where it can jump up to 50 or more amps.  If you need this capability, look atSchumacher XC103 SpeedCharge Battery Charger with Engine Startor perhapsSchumacher XC75 SpeedCharge Battery Charger with Engine StartAlthough it's listed as having four modes, I was only able to figure out 3:  1) Pulse charging (when the battery is very low, below 10.5 volts  2) Regular charging, then (3)trickle charging when it's full.Perhaps the other mode is the AGM mode - this only kicks in when it detects an AGM battery and it's very cold outside - Really kind of a limited situation.I'm using it on some 12V AGM cells right now,",1319587200,2011-10-26

3.0,"Easy and straight forward installation. Padded ""wedges"" with set screws actually hold the the towing mirrors to the factory installed mirrors. There is a risk that the ""wedges"" and set screws could be lost when the mirrors are not installed which would render it pretty much useless. These add ons also increase the length of the factory mirror by about 10-12 inches which makes you a little cautious on narrow roads/bridges. I found only marginal increase in field of view as opposed to just the factory mirrors alone, maybe an additional 10 or 15 percent. I also found that the right,(passenger side) mirror is a magnifier (""things may appear closer"")so it took me some getting used to. The mountings aren't exceptionally stable so the mirrors vibrate which affects the visual clarity. If you have stock mirrors these may not be the improvement you are looking for but without changing out the factory mirrors all together there may not be many other better alternatives.",1315440000,2011-09-08
5.0,"I own a 2013 BMW Mini Cooper and I haven't taken it in for its first service appointment yet, but I sat down with the head mechanic and asked about keeping the engine clean with my regular routine of spraying Simple Green in the entire engine, scrubbing areas with various foam and bristle brushes, then using a nearby water hose with a light trickling of water to clean the engine off, then applying a spraying of 303 Aerospace over the whole bay and let dry for a few hours.  The mechanic said it would be much appreciated  during servicing, as a clean engine is easier to diagnose and work on, and the dressing helps keep the rubber hoses in the engine from deteriorating, which are usually the things to fail first and need replacing.I use 303 Aerospace solely as an engine dressing, and while the instructions say to spray on and wipe off after a few minutes, when it comes to engines, clean the engine, and while wet, soak the entire bay with 303 Aerospace.  If possible, leave the hood open and let it air dry for a few hours.  Close the hood after that and engine cleaning is done!I have Klasse VLR protectant for my usual treatment of exterior plastic/vinyl areas but when doing the engine, I often go over the car exterior with 303.  Can't hurt.Highly recommend this for engine dressing.Keep in mind, this will not 'restore' plastic/vinyl to look like new.  It'll keep the materials looking the way they do.  So if you have a brand new car, start using this and it'll keep the car looking new.  If you have faded or worn out areas, it'll keep those areas from getting worse, but won't make it look better.  This works as a protectant, but doesn't restore.For restoration, you'll need to research other products.I keep this in my auto detailing kit always.",1357344000,2013-01-05

I used every product in this kit on one Sunday morning (see photos) and was very pleased with the results.

The wheel cleaner works very nicely on aluminum wheels.  I also use the Meguire's endurance tire gel on the side walls of my tires.I keep this entire kit in a small container in my car.  If a bird or tree decides to leave its droppings, I promptly mop it up and hit it with a little spot of wax (why not?)

I actually wrote in and asked Meguiar's if it could be used with their 105 compound. They said yes and I ordered the machine.Unfortunately, the pads would not stay on at the higher speeds in order to cut through the scratches and there is no way it would cut 1,200 to 1,500 sand lines like they advertise it doing in many of their videos. So, I learned that issue on the trunk, and did the rest of the car with 3,000 and after several applications of 105 at the slower speeds got the car to shine and ready for the 205 polish.I did write in to Meguiar's regarding the pad issue and they did send me a pad and a new backing plate. Unfortunately, they sent me the 5""-6"" backing plate and NOT the 7"" plate that this machine is all about, so what's the point? Locally, ONLY 8"" pads are available in all the parts stores, so that's another issue, your pads must be ordered also.I thought I did all my homework before I ordered this product and looked at videos and reviews all over the place. I guess I didn't pay enough attention because when I received the machine and reviewed specific videos on product use I noticed many of the Meguiar's training videos show Maguire's folks using a MAKITA ROTARY tool and a WOOL pad at high speeds! I think that should have been a CLUE!Anyway, in my next life I am going to at least go down to the local auto paint supply store and see what they are offering before I buy online. While 3M stuff is not so prevalent in the auto supply stores around here and I haven't seen any ""good"" DA's with the pressure responsive motors and the speed ranges of the online stuff, I'm sure they must have a complete set of products that local professionals are using for about the same price ... less the aggravation.I've used Meguiar's products since the Blue Coral era in the 70's and between this DA thing and multiple problems with their failing spray bottles I am moving on to other vendors.",1338336000,2012-05-30

My only concern is that uses a 12 foot power cord that worked fine for me but will be a problem for someone who can't park his or her car near an electrical outlet.The vacuum cleaner is light and easy to carry. It comes with a carpet tool, console brush and crevice brush in addition an attached blower grip handle.  All these brushes and tools have storage spaces on the vacuum so and are easy to attach and detach from the vacuum.The suction of the vacuum is strong and it picked up dirt that was under my car seats as well as between an arm rest/storage console that is between the two front seats in my car (I used the Crevice Brush for this). This is a good feature since I have used hand held vacuums that charged in my house and these had much less suction.All three attachments work well. The bristles on the crevice brush and console brush are soft enough so that they won't damage anything. The carpet tool is long enough to get under my car's front seats. There is an exhaust blower feature that works but I have yet to use it on anything.It is easy to change to dirt collection basket.My only concern as mentioned above is that this vacuum only works plugged into an electrical outlet and cannot be charged at an electrical outlet.  I have a garage with an electrical outlet so this is no problem for me especially with a 12 foot cord.  In addition, I have found that vacuums that can be charged at electrical outlets don't seem to have great suction and this vacuum is powerful.

When I asked again to return this product they stated to me that I could not as too much time had passed. I feel that they sent me a useless item to set me up while waiting for time to run out. In the end I have three remotes that do not work and am out the money. I wish I would have not purchased this.,1389398400,2014-01-11
5.0,"I used this to change my front brakes recently. I had never used a tool like this before. I've always just used a C-Clamp on the caliper. This tool was very simple to use. You just put an old brake pad on the caliper piston, stick the tool in the caliper, and turn the knob. The tool feels sturdy enough to last through many brake jobs. It is easy to use. It was a little more difficult for my car because it has 2 piston front brake calipers, so I had to go back and forth in the caliper to make sure that both pistons got compressed. It still was not hard to use, it just took a few minutes longer.I am very pleased. I would buy this again, but based on how this felt when using it, I don't think I will have to.",1381276800,2013-10-09

5.0,"I'm very pleased with the Energizer 500-Watt power inverter. It offers a lot of convenience in a portable package. It can also be permanently mounted in the vehicle if so desired.

There is a 1000-watt start-up surge rating, which seems to be enough for most things a person would normally want to run off a power inverter.",1377648000,2013-08-28
5.0,Removes brake dust grime with ease. I was especially impressed with the results of my chrome wheels but works great on my painted wheels as well.

4.0,"I was never really a car buff and have always thought that one soap is the same as another.  I just purchased a slightly used VW GTI that I am in love with, and it's in perfect condition. I am determined to keep it that way, so I took a leap and purchased this kit.  I kind of laughed at first when the wash was labeled ""shampoo and conditioner,"" thinking that was a bit excessive.  I was wrong.  This stuff leaves your car looking beautiful, the finish so smooth and it even smells great. The mit also makes it easy to wash.  If you have a new car, the entire kit may be unnecessary, because the wash itself does the job.  Down the line I may use the others, but right now they aren't really needed.I haven't tried the wax, or ScratchX (not needed yet).  I couldn't really tell if the PlastX did much because my headlights are in great shape anyway, but it certainly smelled like it would do a job and it left the lights feeling and looking smooth.The Quik Interior Detail seemed the same to me as any other Detail Cleaner.  It's not shiny or greasy like some others, but it doesn't really wow me either.  I did however try Armor All on my interior before and it ate up some of the softtouch coating on the console!  This didn't do that, which is a huge relief!  At first I thought the gel was for the wheels, be it is actually for the tires.  It leaves them looking a slick black for days, but it would have been better if a gel applicator was included in the kit.  I used an old towel and it was a greasy mess.I gave the kit itself 4 stars because it didn't include the tire gel applicators and it only comes with one towel. The microfiber is great and prevents scratches but you will want more than one. All in all,it may have been smarter to purchase some of the items separately as needed.  You will definitely want the shampoo/conditioner, a few of microfiber towels and the mitt.  If you want the tire gel, definitely invest in some applicators.",1337904000,2012-05-25

5.0,Very useful charger. I mounted it in the engine bay near the battery and it works as intended.Only downside to this charger is the length of the plug cord. It worked well for my application though because i mounted it in tandem with a flush-mount sealed power port on the side of the vehicle.It allowed my battery to remain topped up and warm enough to start at 35 below zero like it was no big deal.I will be ordering a second for an other vehicle.,1396051200,2014-03-29

2.0,"There are better choices in air compressors than this unit. I don't like the fact that the digital gauge stops working after it reaches the preset pressure.  The unit must be unplugged and plugged in again to get the gauge working again.  Also, the gauge is not very accurate.  The compressor takes too long to inflate my car tires to the correct pressure (32psi). It may be good for light duty stuff like pool floats and the like but it is not powerful enough to inflate auto and truck tires. This may be a good compressor to leave in the car for emergencies but there are better choices.

4.0,"I have an original California Jelly Blade that I bought from Amazon. I was surprised I couldn't reorder, so looked around and started reading the reviews. I bought a Pilot Automotive CC-2010 and really didn't like it. The handle was too hard and the blade felt short. Frustrated, I tracked down the website that seemed to be for the manufacturer and wrote the following email:""Hi Don,I'm one of many who came to greatly appreciate the original California Jelly Blade, and am looking for a replacement. Every review comparing ""Superflex"" with the original says it is too flexible. The Pilot ultraflex is no longer available if it ever was. The ""Soft-N-Dry"" doesn't work well and the handle is too hard for the shower. (I bought one.) The California Car Duster Jelly blade is clearly avoiding the original patents and isn't a ""t-bar"" blade. Your website has a ""gel"" version that doesn't appear to be for sale anywhere.My questions:1) Which one is closest to the original original?2) Where can I buy it?3) Why not make one to those specs again?Thanks!Larry""I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Don is the inventor. Here is his reply:""Larry, I quite frankly can't understand people not liking the Superflex that is what i prefer and I designed them all, I have all of them in my garage and I'll grab the Superflex every time. The Gel blade was turned down because of cost, I designed that model as well, however I still prefer the Superflex. Feel free to call if you have questions!!  Don""So I bought a Superflex and it is good, but not quite as good as the original. The handle is right. The length is right. Whew. However, it really is, as some suggested, too flexible. Not a lot too flexible, but just enough that it takes a little more concentration, a little more feedback to use it. Hence the four stars. However, it works very, very well, and is better than the original on curved surfaces such as my car.I believe this is, as Don suggests, the right one to buy. However, I wish it would be just a little stiffer, say halfway between where it is now and the original. Then we're moving forward with this product and I'm not longing for a past product I can no longer buy.",1362009600,2013-02-28

I have a big old Dodge diesel that is a work truck and after washing the mud off I cleaned half of it using this product and was amazed at how good it looked. I had to finish the other side and my husband was also amazed. He actually used it on his precious truck and was satisfied with the results.

3.0,"Bought this to try out because Royal Purple gets such rave reviews.  There are two 20W50 formulas from Royal Purple, but I had a hard time discerning what the difference actually is, so I got this one (cheaper).  Compared to Mobil 1 20W50, my motorcycle runs hotter and the valve train makes more noise.  After about 2500 mi., I drained it out and put Mobil 1 back in.  Much better.  Also, the oil causes the engine to produce a ""sweet"" smell.  This is normal according to Royal Purple and due to its formula, but, mixed with exhaust, it smells awful.  My bike doesn't burn oil... it's just the smell Royal Purple is associated with.  I don't like it.  Also, Royal Purple oil new is very dark (and dark purple).  Mobil 1 is the standard synthetic light brown/amber color.  At least I can tell with Mobil 1 that the oil is contaminated - it turns dark, not starts dark.  Not a fan, and will use the rest of my bottles in the primary or hand it over to friends who are willing to trust it.  I'm sure it's fine, but not for me.",1314230400,2011-08-25

5.0,"To start with, you can't do much better than the fine review J. Schaeffer put up on this and comparable units. His info made this purchase a slam dunk for me. Long story short, I don't think there's a better value in inflators.Here's a few pros and cons than may not have come up elsewhere+ Solid and well made. The unit is heavy and everything on it is substantial, including the little storage ports for the inflation accessories.+ Easy use. Connect it, run it until you're ready to check pressure, switch it off to see if tire is fully inflated.+ Fills quickly. I'm ready the leave at the same time as the kids with on-board compressors.+ Long cord and hose - keep in mind I have a 2 door Wrangler; your longbed crewcab may be another story.+ Compact. Fits great in the storage well of my Jeep JK's back seat area, along with a tow strap and receiver hook.+ Threaded valve - positive connection that doesn't pop off like garage style clipsCons- Gauge seems vary  3-4 #- Gets hot. Of course the body of the pump gets hot, but even the hose near the unit gets uncomfortably hot. You'll find out when your fills are done and you go to coil it up. Gloves are a nice idea.One thing I might note: I let the Jeep idle while I fill and the unit sounds like it's cycling up or down, but I've concluded this is due to additional loads on the battery switching on and off while your vehicle runs. It's particularly noticeable if your air conditioning is on while you fill.I've used this unit 4 times since I got it, and have been impressed every time. This is a first-line purchase for any off-roader, and a great piece of kit for any light portable inflation needs. This is the one to get!",1379808000,2013-09-22

4.0,"I used this on a 2007 Honda Civic and a 1997 Honda Accord. In both cases the results were nice, but the effect seemed better on the 2007 Civic. I also learned a few things when I used this product.I started out by shaking the bottle well (as per the instructions) and then spraying all over the driver side of the dashboard, steering wheel and the control panel - basically I sprayed on surfaces as far as my hand could reach from the driver side. The point is that I thought I'd spray as much as I could at first, and then wipe away. Bad idea! And don't do it if it's your first time. Because it turned out that the somewhat milky liquid dries up fairly quickly. And it starts to leave behind a residue if you don't wipe it quickly enough. I ended up spraying over the same surfaces again, this time only a little and then wiping quickly. Then it worked well. Once I learned that lesson, everything was fine.The shine that this detailer left behind was very noticeable on my tan interior of the Civic. Not so much on the dark grey interior of the Accord. But still, in both cars, it ended up cleaning all surfaces very well. And as others mentioned, the smell is very nice!One more tip. Try not to spray on the windows - or if you do, make sure you wipe it off quickly, while you can still see it. Because if you don't, that same residue that I spoke of earlier may affect your sight later on. For me I didn't notice I had some of this liquid on the passenger side window, and only while driving I noticed that there was some of this liquid blocking my clear vision of the side mirror. Little dangerous. So be careful and wipe away all the liquid that you spray quickly.",1402358400,2014-06-10

2.0,"Automatic is the ""Smart Driving Assistant"" that is supposed to help you be a more efficient driver by monitoring your driving quality and telling you how to improve.  In short, this is the most expensive ODB II code reader you will find that has such a limited set of features.  I understand what they are trying to do (keep it simple), and overall, it does work as advertised.  I was hoping there was more ""under the hood"" and discovered that it is really quite limited.In the box, you get the white Automatic ODB II code reader dongle.  If you've never seen this connector, it is likely under the dashboard of your car.  There isn't much else in the box other than a nice little ""A"" sticker you can put on your window to let everyone know you've got the cool new Automatic in your car.  You will also need the iPhone app called ""Automatic"" and an iPhone 4S or later.  The reason this won't work on an iPhone 4 or earlier is because it uses low-power Bluetooth, a protocol not supported on the earlier iPhones.  Unlike a bluetooth headset, you don't need to pair this with your iPhone.  With the new protocol, it just works.I installed the Automatic app on my iPhone 5S.  First, it was a little disappointing that it requires me to give my name, e-mail address, and create an account/login to their site to use the app.  There goes privacy right there.  Why can't it just tell me how I am driving without requiring me to be registered on their site?When I first plugged Automatic into my car, I got a nice beep from the device itself to let me know it was plugged in.  The Automatic app on my iPhone (now that I was registered) failed to find the device.  I tried to plug and unplug a few times, but eventually I force-closed the app (double click the home button on the iPhone and throw away the app), and re-launched it.  On re-launch, it found my dongle.Once in the app, it is fairly simple.  When you drive your car, it will alert you if you do one of three bad things - hit the brakes hard, drive over 70, or have a hard acceleration.  If that happens, a small sound will play and your ""driver score"" will get dinged.  When you stop the car, it will record your distance, MPG, and a rough estimate of the cost of that trip based on current gas prices.  It also will maintain a cumulative driver score.  The nice part about the app is that it essentially provides you a log of your drives while it runs in the background of the iPhone, so you can look back on your driving history.There is also an engine status page where you can see the status of the engine and read any codes that may be thrown.  If your car has a check engine light, it can advise you what is wrong.  A problem with the vapor recovery system might require tightening the gas cap.  Yes, this can save you a trip to the mechanic, but I'm not sure how many other codes are that simple.So why only 3 stars?First, I was hoping that the driving statistics would be more meaningful.  How about a graph of my acceleration over the trip, car efficiency, oxygen sensors, etc?  In fact, none of the internal sensors are brought out so I can view them, much less logged over time.  All of this data is aggregated into my driver score.  I can buy a reader for my car that costs less than this and will link with my laptop to provide live car readouts.  I get that this isn't their target market, but they are charging a lot more for this than their competition.  It's ""just software"", so why not provide an ""advanced"" screen with live engine status readouts?  Why not log speed data?  It just doesn't do that much.Second, there are plenty of highways where the speed limit is above 70.  Why not let me customize this limit?  This device is not going to be useful in places with higher speed limits.Third, I didn't mention it in my review, but there is a Crash assist feature that I am dubious about.  It says it will get me assistance in case of a crash using an accelerometer in the device.  Why not use the accelerometer in my car, or use airbag deployment as a proxy?  How do I know if it is tuned right?  Will an accidental kick set it off?  And who monitors the crash system?  My home alarm system is monitored by a UL approved monitoring company.  General Motors has OnStar.  I have no idea what sort of back-end system Automatic has monitoring crash alerts and what kind of load it can handle.  Not to mention - they don't know my cell phone number.  If I am in a crash, how will the police contact me?  How will I let them know it's a false alarm?  The app and website are really sparse on this data.So conclusion?  In short, it does work.  If your check engine light is on, it will tell you the code and let you reset it, but a $15 reader will do that.  It will alert you if you make 3 driving errors (accelerate too fast, drive too fast, or brake too suddenly), but even then, the ""drive too fast"" won't let you customize it for the road.Based on the data they've given me so far, I have little confidence in Crash Alert (it even says ""Beta""), and I am sorely disappointed that for $100, I can't view engine status, sensors, or anything else in my car.  At the very least, allow me to log acceleration data on the drive.3 stars - the hardware seems to work, but the software has a long way to go to justify the price.UPDATE:After using this for 2 weeks, going on a long car trip, and driving through a congested city, I am updating this to 2 stars as I am removing it from my car and putting it away until Automatic releases a serious software update.  It is beyond useless.  I drove down I-95 to Richmond where the speed limit is 70.  As soon as I hit the speed limit, it started beeping at me - very distracting while driving.  As I said before, if you can't even drive the speed limit without getting your driver score dinged, what is the point?  I also had a car in front of me stop short.  I slammed my brakes and got beeped at again.  I don't know what the folks at Automatic expect me to do when a sudden obstacle is in front of my car, but I fear the beeping alarm could cause me to get startled and have a real accident.My hopes for this device were that it would be like the Prius in terms of driver feedback.  I don't own one, but I've driven one and noticed the live readout of your MPG.  You learn to slowly apply the accelerator and how exactly to drive to maximize fuel economy.  It is a live readout of everything.  That is what Automatic could have done - live readouts during a drive.  Instead, I get a binary decision on 3 factors.  Two of those factors can be violated for normal reasons that have nothing to do with bad driving habits, and the distracting alarm could cause a real accident.  The only feedback I get during a drive itself is a rotating icon that lets me know a drive is in progress.  Seriously?  No other live display?Meanwhile, by hiding all engine sensor data, there are real things like dirty air filters and low tire pressure that could be reported and could really help fuel economy.  But Automatic ignores this data from the car computer.Seriously, I do not recommend this device.",1382745600,2013-10-26

5.0,"Installed these LED lights as replacements for the round OEM halogen fog lites which gave my vehicle a last-century look. These compliment the HIDs by giving off white light & being brighter than the halogens.

They are thick, solid metal & have cooling fins built into the housings. They are easily aimed and set following installation (HIGHLY recommended) using the included Allen wrench . They are fantastic on dark mountain highways, on dark streets, or, on long, dark, stretches of interstates. They use only 36 watts (3.0 amps) instead of the OEM Halogen's 110 watts (9.2 amps) thereby protecting the switch & wiring & eliminating the need for relays in the circuit.

The filters do come with instructions, which are pretty helpful.However, a step-by-step video is online that is extremely useful. I did not remove the glove box like they did - and I was still able to have success.

3.0,"This is a good idea for a product because most of us have car noises and vibrations we'd like to eliminate. However, I have a couple issues with this product.For one thing, the instructions are intimidating. After reading them (and re-reading them), I decided this would be best installed by someone who's done this kind of thing before. I could do it, but I'd likely end up messing up and the frustration level seems high. The examples illustrated on the package are not impressive, and I'm sure I would do much worse.Secondly, to do a thorough job it appears that you need more than one box of this mat. For example, to apply the mat to the trunk area requires 2 boxes (the estimated time is 30 minutes--I assume this is for a professional), and 1 box is required for each door (the estimated time is 15 minutes per door.)I might consider trying to use the mat for speaker installation because that requires less than one box. However, in looking at the illustration I'm again intimidated.This might be a great product if you've had experience with something like it before, but I'm going to leave this one to the professionals.",1365638400,2013-04-11

Terror. I called the dealership about my engine light and a &#34;diagnostic reading&#34; was $150 then they could tell me what needed to be done. So that engine light, that may have popped on for nothing more than me crossing some imaginary mile, could cost me $150 for nothing more than to have them to turn it off.

5.0,"I personally think this Novus #2 fine scratch remover is a great product. I've been using it rather indiscriminately on just about every type of plastic surface I can find and it really seems to do a decent job with the vast majority of things I've tried it on so far. I don't even bother using their #1 plastic cleaner product first.I've tried other plastic or acrylic polishing products over the years, but they all seem to just fill the scratches with wax or some type of oily film that evaporates after a couple of days, leaving the surface looking as crappy as ever. This polish actually buffs out most of the small scratches and leaves a shiny, polished surface that really lasts.I've used it to remove the small surface scratches on the displays of my expensive Fluke Scopemeter and favorite 87-IV DMM, as well as my old Fluke 36 and newer 337 clamp meters with surprisingly good results.It brought the eye shields on my bench grinder back to life after I accidentally dripped clear PVC primer on them while installing a new drain line overhead. I never thought that the etched opaque spots the primer left would ever come out, but this stuff has made them crystal clear again. With that in mind, I also tried it on several pairs of scratched up safety goggles and a face shield that I normally would have thrown away, but they are now all completely usable again.I had some old Craftsman screwdrivers with clear plastic handles that had some kind of scum adhered to them. I used this stuff with an old T-shirt to polish them up. They now look better than they have in years.  I also used this on my older Klein cushion grip screwdrivers. It did a good job cleaning the crud off the black rubber grips as well as the yellow plastic parts of the handles and it even shined up the chrome on the shanks.I started looking around for other things to use it on and so, I polished up the clear plastic gauge faces on my Oxy/Ace tote-a-torch regulators, refrigeration manifold gauges, well pump pressure gauge face, boiler pressure/temp gauge, dashboard gauge cluster in my truck, vinyl grips on several pair of pliers handles, the cushion grip handles on my lineman's pliers and wire strippers, the clear chip shield on my plunge router and jig saw, all of my other meters and test equipment displays, the digital display on my Dewalt work radio, three cordless flashlight lenses, two cordless fluorescent work light lenses, my Mini-Mag LED flashlight lens, my LED headlamp lens, two thermal label maker displays, two clear plastic clock bezels, my cell phone's display, a fiberglass step ladder, our fiberglass shower stall, the headlamp lenses on my wife's car, and on and on. I even tried it on an old Klein polyethylene plastic hard hat I had laying around. Of course, it wouldn't take out any of the scratches on it, but it did make it shine like it hadn't in quite some time.Based on the results I've had, I would have no problem recommending this Novus plastic fine scratch remover.",1311984000,2011-07-30

5.0,"I love this stuff.  I have been using it for years.  I purchased a new car and applied this polymer coating in a few hours.  It is easy to hand buff off, and leaves a deep, slippery shine on the car.  You MUST follow the directions for putting it on, including making sure the paint is in good shape and that the temperature is under 85, AND put it on out of the sunlight.  Also, the directions tell you to let the polymer cure/bind to your paint/clear coat for 12 hours.  This is very important for a good, long lasting shine.  The product fluff says the polymer coating lasts six months.  But, 4 months is about the limit in the Arizona sun.",1362528000,2013-03-06
2.0,"Just got through using this applicator pad. Did not like it. Would not absorb the paste wax such that I could not go very far without having to dip back into the can again for more wax. Very wasteful of my time and my wax. My hand cramped while using it.  I now realize that I prefer a thinner pad.I see nothing 'premium' about it, and I have used lots of applicators over the years, including foam, microfiber, and even the little pad I got with my  P21s Concours wax.

5.0,"This is such an easy leather conditioner to use. Once you know your leather is clean and dry, it just takes a little of the conditioner on the (provided) foam applicator and some circular rubbing. I've tried it on top grain leather (shoes and purses) as well as full grain leather like our sofa and ottoman. It goes in nicely and leaves a great shine on the top grain, darkening the color a bit while moisturizing the leather. The full grain leather gets just a hair darker but it also a lot more of the conditioner because it soaks in so much. So it is probably better suited for full grain items.Once I applied it and it dried, I buffed it up a bit to take away any uneven areas. It looks great, repels water better and is really easy to use.I was provided a sample for testing and review.",1396224000,2014-03-31

It wasn't until after I had them on for a while that I noticed the 28"" does not cleanly touch the glass surface in the center of the spread, the point where the blade attaches to the wiper arm. This leaves a wet 2"" channel arc right in my line of sight. I thoroughly examined the blade and the attachment, making sure it was attached as intended. It was. My guess is that the pressure that keeps the outer edges of the blade firmly on the glass is so strong it lifts the center up. The 18"" appears to be ok. I wish I still had the box to send it back.

4.0,"This seems to be a good quality for the price and comes with all needed cords and connectors.  Even the connectors have end seals to keep them clean and dry when not in use.One set of cords can clip directly to the battery posts/clamps and another set can do the job through your Acc/cigarette lighter socket.  Be sure you know if your Acc/cigarette lighter socket has power running to it when the ignition key is turned off or it will not get power to your battery.  Simple test is with the supplied lighter plug harness...  if you plug it in (without panel attached) the LED will light if socket is live and will remain off if not.  If you can't use it this way, you can connect the large aligator clips to the battery posts under the hood.Case is made from ABS plastic, Cord on the panel is 8 foot long, lighter cord set is 22"" including ends as is the cord set with post clips.  Both cord sets have built in 8A fuses.I checked mine with a multimeter while in direct bright sunlight and found 22 volts at 180mA output.  It will still have output in less light but at a bit lower output.180mA is not that much amperage but should maintain a peak charge IF the battery is in good condition and fully charged to start with.  Don't expect it to bring a dead battery back to life however.  Older batteries have higher and higher internal drain so don't expect it to keep it charged if battery is pretty old.Made to work with 12V lead acid, Gel Cell, MF(mantanence free) or AGM (absorbed glass mat) type batteries.If you are used to electrical devices both AC and DC you are tuned in to the fact that when something gets hot there can be trouble.....  this black solar panel gets quite warm/hot when left in the Sun and at first seems wrong and cause for alert for short etc.  But, there is no way for it NOT to get hot in the Sun when in normal use.Comes with soft plastic suction cups for each corner of the panel to stick to the inside glass of your vehicle..  Suctions cups are not the highest quality and come deformed from being in the small plastic bag inside the box.  I suggest you soak the cups in some pretty hot water  and then stick them to something while they cool down in order to get them flat to stick better on your glass.  Don't forget, they have to hold up almost 1 1/2 pounds of solar panel with glass on the front.  Also make sure the suction cups are pushed all the way through the holes on the panel and lock out the other side.  One of mine did not want to lock in, but only required a bit of a nudge from small screw driver from the backside.If you need/want more output power, this company has a larger unit available.I will use mine on a lawn tractor battery to keep it ready to crank.  I suspect it works better on a smaller lawn or motorcycle battery as compared to a full size car/truck battery.  But... I'd love to be wrong at this price.Although, I will also take this along camping and use it with 12V gell cell battery & adapters to keep the cell phones and iPods working.I've done as Battery Life company suggested and sealed the panel case around all frame edges to keep moisture out.  Don't forget how hot this gets in the Sun, if you don't use good quality silicone sealer, it could go bad sooner.",1362355200,2013-03-04

4.0,"For a comparison between this kit and the Power Tank kit (which I would recommend over this ARB kit) see the Power Tank KIT-8133 page.This ARB kit is SOLID. Each tool is incredibly high quality, including the valve core tool and the tire gauge. Even the allen wrenches are high quality. These tools could stand daily abuse in a tire shop, it seems.The only complaint is that the kit is relatively simple and doesn't include many accessories. I'm not entirely sure what the black tubes that it comes with are, but they are very cheap looking plastic and don't seem very functional.The only downside (and what looses 1 star) is that the blow molded case is WAY to big. It is gigantic compared to the tools it contains. This whole kit should be at least 1/3 the size. The fact that it is this big now means that I can't find any appropriate space/room for it in my Wrangler JK. It sticks out like a sore thumb and storage space in a Jeep is at a premium to begin with.If you're the casual 5-10 time/year user or less, then go with the Power Tank kit. It will suit you much better (it also has more accessories) because it is much smaller and lighter. If you're a heavy 1/week user, then buy ARB.

3.0,"The lens on my headlights were definitely in need of some cleaning/polishing, so I opted to try this product. I found the directions a little confusing. They identify four pads that you use to basically sand down the lens. But the box contained three pads, two of which are the exact same number. So right from jump street I was lost. Anyway, I did the best I could to follow the directions as close as possible with what was available. After sanding back and forth, up and down, I dried the lenses and applied the PlastX special sauce. I buffed the lenses as best I could with the included polishing cloth. After completing these tedious tasks, I applied the ""bonus"" polish that is included in a squeeze packet.After all of this, I stood back and convinced myself that my headlights looked newer. But in all honesty, I don't really think they looked much better, and they certainly didn't reflect all of the effort I applied to do this.While this product is not very expensive, I recommend that you look for other alternatives that claim the same thing, but that take much less effort and elbow grease.",1367971200,2013-05-08

I've used this for a few weeks and I'm already impressed by it - the physical build quality is great, no loose or rattling parts, the compressor is not overly loud and doesn't &#34;jump&#34; all around the pavement during the work. The hose and the screw-on chuck are also pretty sturdy and feel like they would last a very long time. The built-in pressure gauge is fairly accurate (just make sure to turn compressor off before looking at the gauge) but you should still get a separate dedicated tire pressure gauge (preferably not some cheap plastic crap with digital display). The only minor drawback is the lack of the storage bag but it's not an issue if you primarily store it at home and you can find plenty of aftermarket bags which can easily fit this in. Overall it's a great product and much, much better than various similar products by more &#34;recognizable&#34; brand names.One minor warning, though - make sure to measure the distance between your car's battery terminals and the rear tires on your vehicle BEFORE purchasing this model. The attached power cable and the hose are long enough for most cars and compact SUVs but you might need to order power cable extension or purchase a different model (Viair sells plenty of these) with longer cable/hose if you have a pickup truck with a long bed length or a large SUV.",1403395200,2014-06-22

Spray a 2' x 2' area of your car with the spray detailer, then begin claying, side to side, no circles.  You will have to continue spraying as you move to maintain lubricity, and after you have completed a few sections, fold the clay in on itself to expose a fresh surface.  If you drop your clay, or it becomes too soiled, throw it out.  If you find the clay thinning out too quickly, ease up on the pressure and/or use your palm instead of your fingers to move the clay around.

The hole I made to make things work takes the waist in as far as it can possibly go and I am glad it fit there at least because it wouldn't go any smaller.  These are not lined chaps, though, which I knew when ordering.  I can still feel the cold through them on a chilly morning but they definitely make it better than without.  Also, I live in a warm climate so I was looking for chaps I could wear on the warmer days as well.",1355875200,2012-12-19

5.0,"I've used Slime Spair Repair in a can before, that worked great so I bought this kit because it included an air compressor that runs off the 12V plug in the car.  I didn't expect much from a small compressor, but this surprised me.  I was able to add 10 PSI to my mini-van's large tire in about 1 minute.  That is much quicker than other portable air compressors that I've used.I would definitely recommend (and have already done so) product to friends and family.Nice compact unit that comes in a case with velcro to attach to the carpet of the car so it does not slide around.  Love it!Was going to buy a 2nd unit for my other car, but now the price went up to $50 :(NOTE: I am unable to find the refill Slime cartridge for this unit, except for the Slime website for $13 plus $11 to ship, which is way expensive!

3.0,"I washed my car thoroughly and then used a Meguiars polish - fine cut cleaner. I thought the polish was actually fantastic as it took out water spots and fine scratches as well. I was a little disappointed with the Carnauba Wax though. It was easy to use. Perhaps it needed two coats, but I was just plain beat ! It may just be that my paint is not the highest gloss ? That's a possibility. If that is the case, then I will be using Nu finish from now on for this vehicle. At $7.99 for a can in which the product itself will literally last a year with a very good shine, that's for me. I found that this wax left a shine similar to Meguiars NXT and that will last a year as well. This carnauba wax will probably last for 60-90 days or so if it is a normal carnauba wax.My Wife's car has a super gloss black paint and I may try this for that, however, I may not after being disappointed. I may just stick with the NXT Tech Wax. I will have to see how it shines up.",1362182400,2013-03-02
2.0,"I bought this product in removing fine surface scratches from my black 2007 Chevy Cobalt.  The paint is still in great condition and only has some minor surface scratches from automatic carwashes.The first time I used Meguiar's Ultimate Compound I used an orbital buffer.  The instructions are quite vague and more or less state that all you have to do is rub the compound in a circular motion in a small area then buff away.  So I figured if that was all you really had to do, an orbital buffer would be more than enough.Wrong.While Ultimate Compound is excellent at removing water spots (and even dead bugs and tar) it is horrible at removing swirl marks and fine scratches.  I can use a simple wax and get the same results as with this ""Ultimate"" compound.The second time around I decided to try the product on my victory red 2001 Chevy Blazer.  Years of automatic car washes have really taken their toll on the paint, but not so much that it had lost all of its shine.  Instead of the buffer, I used a 100% cotton terrycloth and some good ol' elbow grease.  Unfortunately I got the same results as before.I can get the same result that this product offers by using Turtle Wax Ice and in a fraction of the time.Do I recommend this product? NoWill I buy this product again? Probably not",1274659200,2010-05-24
4.0,"I was pretty skeptical about the Whole Car Air Refresher, as Febreeze and other air freshener products had not made a noticeable dent on the &#34;wet-dog&#34; smell in my old 4runner.  Roll up the windows, run the air on recirculate and pop the top on the bug bomb looking can.  15 minutes later, open the car up (carefully, the concentrated version isn't too pleasant) and let the car air out.  15 minutes isn't really enough- I did it for several hours.  But afterwards, the wet dog smell was gone and a reasonable version of new car smell had replaced it.  And so far the dog smell hasn't returned.  The new car smell isn't my first choice of replacement smell, but compared to &#34;wet Saint Bernard&#34; sent its perfectly acceptable.  Count me as pleasantly surprised on this, as the Whole Car Air Refresher did work in my case, and is a lot cheaper than a ozone generator.",1401148800,2014-05-27
5.0,"I love buying quality products and buying them online.  This was no exception. I purchased this jack on a promotion for 20% bringing the total to around $240.This jack is great for a few reasons, which of course aren't inherit to this jack alone.1. It's aluminum.  After using steel jacks for so long, the aluminum is a real dream.  It's so easy to move around where I want under the car.  It's even easier to push around the garage. It rolls amazingly, partially by the front wheel design.  You may think it's not a big deal to push a steel jack around, but that's because you've never had an aluminum jack.2. The jack gets to max height very quickly with minimal effort compared to the craftsman jacks I have used which is a great thing.3. The jack stands are great.  They have a pin to lock them into place which makes me feel really safe.  They're also really light and convenient.4. Build quality seems great and the jack and stands are beautiful looking.

4.0,"Purchased these to replace my older steel ratchet stands.  These are lightweight and I like the pin through design, provides a much better safety design and better piece of mind.  The only thing is I may consider is lengthening the chain to be able to slide the pin on top, above the the red portion instead, directly through the grey extendable section.  If I work on many different heights, it will be easier to move the heights around.  The base is flat without any wobble.  The top support is approximately under 3"" x 3"" surface area.I have a couple pairs and I recommend these over the ratchet types.  These are slower to release and drop down than the ratchets but clearly easier to see the jacks are 'locked' and ready to use, over the ratchet types.  Plus, no fear of rusting.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",1368921600,2013-05-19

It's easier to fill and empty with the lid fully removed instead of dangling and potentially getting in the oil stream. It's not like you're likely to misplace the lid.

3.0,"I have mixed feelings about these bags. I replaced a set of Dowco teardrop shaped sport saddlebags with these. The Dowco's held more stuff and were fairly waterproof, even without the rain covers. I bought these bags in order to match the tail bag I had purchased, since they were a ""system"" but let me tell you... these things are not nearly as ""water resistant"" as they are advertised to be. In fact, without the built in day-glo rain covers (which ARE nice to have), these bags allow even the lightest sprinkling of rain in. You better use a waterproof liner if you have anything that needs to be kept dry. IF you have enough forewarning to put the rain covers on, you're good but get caught in a sudden down pour and your stowed gear is damp, at the least. Over all, for the price (and for the fact that all my soft-sided luggage now matches) I'd say it was a good buy.

The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection.

4.0,"-Used this in two of my car interiors, lexus and murano.-Nice cool white color, but there is a slight, nearly unnoticeable blue to it.-I have tried others ranging from ebay(its a gamble), superbright leds(great product but pricey), to vleds(medicore/good) and this ones is up to par and much cheaper, esp for a packet of 4.A couple bugs with led for car int..-Based on my experience, led's have different levels of pulsing (when the car engine is on) from diff brands, but this one has very minimal pulses and nearly unnoticeable. I am guessing that this is the norm for cars that are designed to light up the interior with halogens and I rather not invest too much finding the perfect bulb.-The fade in/out feature for interior lights, while locking/unlocking the vehicle, can get a bit choppy with certain cars that is not designed for leds. Example: the lexus light fade in/out in comparison where the murano lights dims for a sec then shuts off, making the led flaw in the lexus noticeable.I would recommend these, just wish someone would have recommended these to me earlier.",1384732800,2013-11-18

5.0,I found these to work very well for applying water based sling free tire dressing.  I spray a small amount of product on the applicator and wipe it directly onto the tire.  No mess and product only goes where I want it.  They clean up well with soap and water.  One tip is to be sure the tire is clean before using.  This will keep the applicator cleaner and allow the dressing to bond better.  For higher shine you can usually add a second application.,1379030400,2013-09-13

In the end I had to buy a second hose from a local store and use the fitting from that to connect to the supplied hose. Dumb. Otherwise the unit works great. We have a camper on a fixed site and we get pumped out once a week - in season. At the end of October they stop pumping for the winter so we bought this item to transport waste to the dumping area.

4.0,"Autotex did a good job of thinking ""out of the box"" when they designed this frameless wiper arm and blade. There are no hinges to collect water and freeze in the winter. So, these would qulify as ""snow blades"".Autotex did a horrible job with the package labelling and graphics. 95% of wiper blade shoppers are guys who avoid the color pink. These guys are going to walk by the purple and pink package that says PINK in letters 6 times the size of the words ""Wiper Blade"". While it is true that the product itself is black, the package implies otherwise. I think it's admirable that the manufacturer donates money to breast cancer research that will potentially benefit my mother, my sisters, my wife and my daughter. Too bad the package will cut sales drastically.One more thing, I was careful to order the right blade for MY application.

The simple answer is - yes it will protect it but you won't like the way it looks.  I tested this on a small part of my car's hood first and it was difficult to spray without dimpling.  Then, once the finish is on, it makes my shiny black car look like it is covered with gray film - not at all what I wanted.  I think this may just be a problem with shiny jet black cars and may be less visible on other colors.

5.0,"I don't eat or drink in my car, but I also don't give people ""rules"" when they get into my car. Therefore, sometimes people get in my car with a beverage and of course I cringe. Just a few days after receiving these, a friend of mine got in with her Starbucks disposable coffee cup. She drank most of it but left the cup in the cup holder. I was driving down the road after dropping her off and it flew out of the cup holder as I took a turn. Very little coffee got on the floor mats, but I immediately stopped at the nearest gas station and went in to wet this compressed towelette. Surprisingly, the texture and strength of this towelette was very good. If I had used paper towels they would have shred to pieces, but this stayed together nicely and completely cleaned the spill up. This is fairly lint free and very strong. I could also see frequent travelers/hikers using these to wash their face and hands with only needing a little bit of water. The texture of these makes clean up very easy. I tried it on my own face and hands and it worked like a washcloth. The waffle weave fibers are very strong yet great at capturing dirt.

5.0,"We have a 25 foot travel trailer and I really like having on board bathroom facilities but the shower is not very roomy. This thing makes a huge difference in available elbow room while showering. We added a shower curtain that has several mesh pockets and our shower space problems are solved. When turned back into the shower space it's also handy to hang wet items, like raincoats, to drip dry .I had some interference with the medicine cabinet but that was solved by installing it just above the top of the cabinet. At this height we could still use a standard 72 inch curtain and still keep the bottom within the shower enclosure. In fact about six inches of the curtain lays on the bottom of the shower floor which assures water does not run onto the floor. After showering I draw the curtain to the back left corner of the shower and hold it there with a nylon cord and a Scotch brand removable hook to which I fasten the cord. This keeps the curtain off the shower floor and allows it to drip dry.  Showering is much more convenient now.",1349308800,2012-10-04

5.0,"It's the only cabin air filter, and it's definitely a great value for a quality filter.  The instructions were easy to follow, the package arrived intact, the filter does what it's supposed to, and it only took me a couple minutes to remove the old nasty filter and replace it with this FRAM Fresh Breeze Cabin Air Filter in my Honda Accord.  The fit was perfect.  I was amazed at the wood mulch which was hiding behind the old filter and I suspect that it was a nest for something or other because we have no wood mulch falling from the sky.  Rude awakening that confirmed the necessity to change this cabin air filter more frequently and I will absolutely once again by the FRAM filter.  Whatever you do, please save your money and enjoy the satisfaction when you change this yourself.  Dealers and some shops will imply or say straight out that you need to have them change the filter and use their product, but I do not agree.

5.0,"I purchased these this past Summer when they are at their cheapest, and used them yesterday (1/2/2014). The roads got worse and worse until cars were literally sliding sideways off the road due to ice, and the snow was still falling fast. I found a (relatively) safe place to pull over, in front of another vehicle with headlights on to help me put them on, got back on the road then I navigated the icy hills and curves with no problem at all. Other cars were doing crazy things all around me. I used mine for 11 miles, the last 9 of which were plowed/salted (didn't feel like taking them off). They were on as tight at the end as the beginning. The ride is very bumpy if you're not going over packed ice and snow.Of course when I got them I tried them to make sure they fit OK, which they did. Some listings have more than one application for the same size tire. If your tire size is one of these, this is a clue that you really have to be careful about fit.After using them, rinse with tap water and then lay them out under a lamp to dry. Then spray them with FluidFilm to prevent rust. You can use WD40 to help get them dry, but it will do nothing to prevent rust beyond that.Pro-Tips:1. Order in Spring or Summer for best price.2. Install one in nice weather. Paint the connector segment that corresponds to ideal tension a bright color.3. Put a pair of work gloves in the box with the chains. Disposable heavy duty rubber gloves are best because they have enough feel to do the connections.4. Keep a tarp, or use a floor mat while installing in bad weather. (I keep a small tarp under a floor mat)5. To install easily, put on top of tire and then push all the way over onto the axle. Pull the far side connector back and hook it up, then pull it back over tire and install near side connector.6. I found that 4 (2 sets) of SC1030 will just fit in one box, if you lay them all on top of each other and roll them up together. This may vary by model.Finally, putting on chains in bad weather is a hassle, taking them off once you reach a plowed road is a hassle, and there will always be bad reviews from folks who got the wrong size (for whatever reason). But when the roads are icy and crazy, there's no substitute, not even studded Winter Tires will do as well.",1388707200,2014-01-03

It took me about 90 minutes to do the All in One and the Sealant (mostly because you have to wait 30 minutes for the sealant to fully dry). However, make sure you use very little. Be sure have plenty of light (not sun light) when applying. I only applied one coat of the AIO and one coat of the KGS.

5.0,"I live in a Condo and so a hose and water are not always conveniently available for a weekend wash job (there is a hose and water, but not within easy access of where I park).  So my poor car often goes a bit too long between washes.  Here's the perfect solution (no pun intended)!  Now I can spot clean and touch up between washes easily because this kit really does work.  Yea, a product that delivers what it promises.The towels that come with the kit are above average in quality.  Most micro fiber cleaning towels I've seen are thinner.  Also, they have a very nice softness, no chemical odors (a sign of quality manufacture), and a decent size.  I'd prefer a little larger, but they are plenty good for the job.  The sprayer also is good and works well.Be sure to watch the video here to see how this is meant to be used.  You do *not* want to apply a lot of pressure!!!  Let the solution/solvent and the microfiber cloth do their job and so avoid scratching your car's finish.  You just wipe and lift off the dirt.  You can buff a little, if needed, afterwards using a clean cloth.  Again, the video shows you exactly how to do this.I will probably use this more for touch up and spot cleaning, but you really can do your whole car with it.  It does work pretty well.  You can buy extra solution and towels here on Amazon.  I recommend cleaning the towels by hand with just a bucket of soapy (dish detergent) warm water.  Agitate and let them soak, then wring, rinse very well, and hang to dry.  They dry quickly.You don't really save much getting the kit, but maybe it will go on sale from time to time.  It seems a fair value to me, given the high quality of the towels and the cost of other comparable products.  And it's so easy to use, you can keep the kit in your trunk and grab it and clean anytime you find yourself waiting around somewhere with nothing to do.",1358553600,2013-01-19

I been doing that for over 40 years and saves a lot of time.WITH THIS TOWEL IT REALLY HOLDS A LOT OF WATER BEFORE IT STARTS TO LEAVE TRAIL ON FINISH TO WHERE YOU NEED TO WRING OUT TOWEL.The water comes pouring out of towel fast and easy WHEN YOU WRING the way its designed with these tiny honey comb shapes that hold water.I detail RVs as well as cars, this is my new favorite McGuire's tool I use daily.Next order to Amazon I am gonna get 2 more.Its more then just a towel it does a great job drying, leaves no streaks, is sewn well not to unravel, tear or get caught on things like terry cloth can and its soft.

5.0,"I have read a lot about PureONE filters' great performance, and many seem to agree that it is the best filter for the money, although some argued it was too restrictive.  According to the marketing on the box, it filters 99% of impurities, which is better than any other filter in the price range and even some more expensive ones.  I decided to try PureONE PL14477 on my family's 2003 Camry LE 4-cyl and 2006 Highlander 4-cyl.The filter feels heavier and seems to have better materials and construction than the cheap filters the oil change shop slapped on my vehicles.  For example, when I grabbed with the filter wrench the filter that the oil change shop used, it separated at the seam where the can and the base of the filter meet.  However, when I was doing the next oil change I grabbed PureONE with the same oil wrench and it left just two small dents in the old filter.  PureOne has rough surface which make it very easy to install and tighten the filter even if my rubber gloves are a little oily.  I also like that it is bright yellow as the color makes finding the filter very easy.  It took me some time to locate the black filter which was installed by the oil change shop.I am not sure what is up with the price for PureONEs on Amazon.

5.0,"Griot's Garage Metal Polish is a very good quality metal polishing cream with aluminum dioxide.  White compounds (such as this) which contain aluminum dioxide are used to finish off soft metals such as aluminum, brass, and copper.  They can also be used as an intermediate stage in polishing iron, steel, and nickel and chrome plating.CAUTION:  This white polish should *not* be used on gold or silver as recommended on the package as it is too abrasive.  Instead, use a good quality polish with jeweler's rouge such asWright's Silver Cream.  It will also remove the protective lacquer from brass.This cream is best applied with a soft cotton material;  an old jersey-knit tee shirt is ideal.  Don't be stingy with the polish&mdash;start off with a generous amount and let the product rather than your thumb do the work.  Double the cloth to provide sufficient cushioning and as the material blackens, switch to a clean area.  A soft cotton flannel is ideal for a final buffing, especially for bright plating.I tested the Griot's polish on a decades-old aluminum Bialetti moka pot and on a chrome-over-brass kettle.  In both instances, it effectively removed oxidation, small scratches, and mild pitting and it left a mirror finish on the aluminum.",1369440000,2013-05-25
5.0,"I'm very pleased with this Bosch C3 Battery Charger, it's not your basic car battery charger because it's a ""Smart Charger"" it's computer controlled meaning it adjusts to the needs of the battery that's being charged. You do need to select the type of battery being charged, car, motorcycle or AGM  but after that this charger takes control. If the charger senses a 12 volt battery is between 8 and 10.5 volts it automatically switches to pulse charging, this allows the battery to recover the best possible way enhancing the charging process for such a low condition. This is just one of the many computer controlled advantages of this type of battery charger.I added the optional Bosch C35AC0 Quick Connect Cable Harness for C3 Battery Charger, it's a direct connect harness you can connect to your car or whatever battery that's installed. You simply plug the charger into the end of the harness, I have one in my sports car that's stored Winters, it makes it very simple to just leave the charger connected, once the battery is fully charged the Bosch C3 charger switches over to a trickle, when I want to use the car I just unplug the harness and drive away.  I can't say enough about this great charger, buy one and you won't regret it!Update: I found that chargers made by NOCO use the same plug and make many options for connecting to different application at a lower price. I'm guessing NOCO makes chargers for Bosch and use the same quick plugs. For the same price as Bosch's C35ACO quick connect harness the NOCO harness includes a battery  monitorNOCO Genius GC015 12V Eyelet Battery Indicator",1316649600,2011-09-22

5.0,"I decided to try this product on the recommendation of a friend who repairs and rebuilds transmissions for a living.  The vehicles I used it in are a 2004 GM 5.3L V8 with 4L60E 4-spd and a 2001 Honda 2.0L I4 AWD auto 4-spd.  The ATF in both vehicles had less than 25k miles on it, so I did not flush the system before using this.  Instead, I drained the pans, added the recommended amount of Lubegard Red ATF Protectant, and then refilled the pan using Valvoline Maxlife ATF in the GM and Honda ATF Z1 in the Honda.The result has been transmissions that shift faster and smoother.  The Honda is also less &#34;jerky&#34; (it has always been pretty sensitive to throttle inputs).  I also noticed the Honda has a more positive torque converter lockup since adding Lubegard.I'm happy with the performance of this product so far and plan on continuing to use it.",1386115200,2013-12-04
1.0,"I got a small construction staple stuck in my tire. Right on the tread, small holes. Exactly what this product is designed for. I followed the directions to a 'T', the Slime ""clotted"" in the hole and stopped the leak, and then I drove a few miles slowly to get the stuff well distributed in the tire. I measured the pressure over a few hours and it held. The next day I drove to work and when I came to my car that evening, the tire was flat. Lost pressure faster than when I had the staple in. It's been extremely cold here (Boston in February) and we've got a lot of snow, so my guess is that this stuff doesn't work too well in those conditions.I know people seem to have good luck with this, but I figured it would be useful to temper things a bit with the perspective of somebody for whom this product didn't work at all. Most importantly, watch out when using this in very cold weather.One more thing: if you look at the reviews you'll see that's it's pretty much either 5 stars (worked for people) or 1 star (didn't at all) with not much in between. It appears to work for about 3 out of 4 people, resulting in a pretty high average review (hence the four star overall rating). And that's assuming the Slime people are uncommonly honest and don't post false positive reviews. Put another way, THERE IS AT LEAST a 25% CHANCE THIS PRODUCT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR YOU. A 25% chance this will cause you far more trouble than if you'd just had the tire patched or used a more conventional tire sealnt, and that will make you deeply regret buying this. I'd actually say that for a product like this a 25% chance of failure is WAY too high. So, consider the 4/5 star review in that context. 4/5 might be a good rating for a TV, but for a product that is fixing something as important to your safety as a car tire, having a 3:1 ratio of five to one star reviews actually isn't that great.",1392940800,2014-02-21
4.0,"**UPDATE I recently installed a set of these on a 2002 Subaru Forester. They are much brighter than OEM and other replacement bulbs as my previous review states on the other vehicles I have used these with.  HOWEVER the DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS NO LONGER FUNCTION by automatically turning on the low beam headlights when the car is turned on. To me this is not a problem, if one wants to drive during the day with their headlights on they can do so by simply turning them on manually. Just note that this may occur if you car is equipped with daytime running lamps.  Personally I prefer them as is and like the complete control of when my headlights are on or off and think exchanging FAR brighter bulbs for them being on automatically during the day is more than worth it, and again the price here on Amazon was much cheaper than in the stores, still think these are the best halogen bulb replacement deal out there.  Fast and easy way to make your headlights brighter.**Yes these bulbs are about as good as you are going to get with your stock headlights, they have a noticeable improvement in brightness over the stock bulbs, but don't expect too much. These bulbs have made the biggest improvement over stock among the various similar bulbs of which I have tried.  I like them a bit better than the Silver Stars for example.  The price here was very good and they basically did about what they were advertised to do.  I would recommend them.  However these or any other bulbs may not be enough if you have other issues such as the clouded headlight lenses. These are good halogen bulb replacements, they will be brighter than stock but not without clear lenses and not turn them in to HID brightness levels.  If you have old clouded lenses as well then using a headlight restoration kit will help a lot as well. I used these bulbs along with one of the Maguires headlight restoration kit with the Plastic X compound. My mothers 98 Toyota Camry had very weak headlights and I noticed the clouded lenses and purchased these bulbs to try to give her the best vision for night driving I could.  Especially important if one does not have the best night vision to begin with.  So that gave her clear lenses again which was needed for any new bulb to work better. This is about as good as one is going to get with a halogen bulb upgrade from all of those I have tried to date and they are very easy to install.  So a good improvement for the money as they are easy to change and inexpensive.It is easy to see the difference in brightness with these bulbs.  Just change one out and turn your headlight on shining on your garage door for example.  It should be obvious they are both brighter and whiter.  The easiest and cheapest way to make  your stock headlights brighter.  While I keep the bulbs I have replaced in the vehicle just in case one is needed in an emergency I have yet to have one of these bulbs burn out prematurely.  I have had them in one vehicle for 2 years and still working.  For about 25 bucks they are both a good deal and better than found at the local parts stores.If they are not bright enough for you just do not make the mistake of going to a plug and play type HID kit...See Below about that.The only real way to get an incredible improvement (3-4 times brighter) from your stock headlight housings is to do a PROPER HID retrofit.  But as for HID I want to make it clear that they are great and will be about 3- 4 times brighter than stock for sure and use less wattage as almost all run at 35 watts. BEWARE if you are going to go with HID's one should NOT buy an inexpensive ""Plug and Play"" kit that uses ballasts and HID bulbs that you stick in your stock halogen headlight housing. Doing so will cause the huge increase in brightness with no control of the beam pattern and while also illegal almost everywhere more importantly they will blind oncoming traffic and are a hazard will likely burn your reflectors in your headlight housings and are just a horrible thing to do period, no exceptions. HOWEVER there is a CORRECT way to upgrade to HID headlights which is known as ""retrofitting"" which means that you install projectors designed for HID bulbs. This is a great improvement and they have cutoff shields built in to the projectors so there is a very controlled but wide and bright low beam and super good high beam output. Doing this requires opening up the actual headlight housing and installing the new projectors and mounting the ballasts and new wiring harness. There is a place that sells these sort of kits for retrofitting and web sites dedicated to this subject. It is far from just plugging in a new bulb such as this so it takes a bit of effort or paying a shop that does HID retrofits to do this for you. Just a warning to those that think the cheap HID kits everywhere are not an option to even consider. Get the best halogen bulbs you can find or do a full HID retrofit. Don't make the mistake that just using a HID plug and play kit such as is commonly sold here and other places is a ""middle of the road option"". It is most likely illegal and never a good idea no matter how enticing the cheap prices seem.Use these halogen upgrade bulbs and if that is not enough for you then go all the way.  There are just way too many that go for these plug and play kits that are illegal and cause accidents that I want the message out that they should not be considered which many that are looking for brighter headlights such as those purchasing these bulbs could potentially consider.

The 10th van had zero juice in the battery (not enough to even dimmly power the cab light or even get a flicker on the dash), and it fired right up without any charge time.My ONLY complain is the charger leads do not grip well onto GM side post batteries (we have some '02 and '04 GMC 2500 vans as well).

Please don't mistake the work ""cleaner"" to mean a substitute for actually washing your car!!

We have two trucks, an F-250 Ford diesel and an F-150 Ford. With hauling our horses and other farm related work, the dust, weather and miles are a test for any wiper blade... the ANCO Contour blades pass that test. I replaced one of the 22 inch blades on the F-250 and one of the 20 inch blades on the F-150. The ""Kwik Connect"" installation was easy. They form a tight fit against the windshield that doesn't faulter with highway speeds. On the other side of the vehicles I used a $30.00 premium wiper blade.

5.0,"I have a 1967 Ford truck that can be quite a drain on the battery at times, especially during the colder months. I purchased this before last winter, and never once had an issue with the battery being too low or too cold, despite some pretty frigid temps. I set this on a shelf just in front of and above my truck, and leave the lead to the charger hanging. I then wired the battery end to my battery and channeled it so the plug end can be pulled through the grill. It's nearly invisible when it's not in use, but is very quick and easy to plug up. I've gotten used to just plugging up the truck every time I'm done with it, and this little puppy brings it up to full charge fairly quickly!Highly recommended, especially if you have an older car that either doesn't get driven much or is a heavy drain on the battery.**********************************************************************************Update 01/02/11:Unfortunately, I sold my '67 truck back in the late summer of 2010. However, this little battery tender was still going strong, so I immediately hooked it up to my 4-wheeler. It has been doing a great job keeping the battery on it charged up through some especially cold weather we've had. So after @3years of use, I still give it 5-stars. Awesome product!Update 11/19/12: I noticed something really smelling in my garage, and spent quite a while trying to find it. It was a horrible ""ozone"" like smell, but clearly was the smell of burning electronics. When I got to my Battery Tender, I noticed the light was no longer on and it smelled really bad, so I immediately unplugged it. I'm not quite sure what happened, but am a little concerned about this. That said, I will consider replacing it as I still believe it's a good product.Update 02/19/13: As these units carry a 10-year limited warranty (if you have your receipt), I decided to send it in. The cost of mailing it was around $9 for standard post, and $11 for Priority Mail. The warranty replacement charge is $12.95 (why not just $13?). So in total, it will cost me just under $25. That is, assuming they replace it, which I certainly hope they will! I will post follow-up later.Update 03/20/13: It took approximately 2 weeks, but Deltran DID replace my charger under warranty. The thing is, the replacement charger - which appears to be brand new, and not refurbished - did not come with ANY paperwork. No ""we're sorry for your inconvenience"" letter, no receipt, no packing slip... nothing. So my warranty on the replacement will only be as good as the remainder of what I had left on my original 10 years (approx 4 years). The inconvenience of the return was frustrating, and I'd have liked at least an acknowledgement of that from Deltran, but it ""is what it is"". Hopefully this new one holds up at least as long as the first.",1215561600,2008-07-09

4.0,"In terms of a ""soft"" cargo carrier for the roof of your vehicle, this Advantage SportsRack cargo bag is likely the best you will get in this price range (I haven't tried all cargo bags so I'll leave some wiggle room).Unlike similar bags with securing straps that seem minimally attached to the bag, this carrier has reinforcement strips crosshatched across the top of the bag with the tie-down straps securing from the edge of the bag. I have seen other bags with the tie-downs on the edge with the actual support extending only a few inches before ending. I like the way these strips extend for the length of the bag. These strips are also double stitched except where they cross a fellow reinforcement strip and a single stitch is used (only a small area).The ad for this bag clearly states that the bag is water-resistant which should not be confused with waterproof. A generous (approximately 1-1/2"") flap is sewn around the bag to enclose the entire zipper area in an attempt to prevent leakage if you are driving through a downpour, but the bag makes a point to advertise that water may leak in at this area and at the seams in certain situations.The actual tie-down straps have a tension-locking buckle (visible in the picture) for securing. I can't say that this is my favorite type of tie-down, so for extended highway driving, I will likely add an additional securing straps across the top.Final notes: The product title lists this bag as black, and it is. I reiterate this only to keep those who look more at the picture than the title from being surprised when a black bag arrives. Also, if you have a small car with a trunk rack and fill this bag up, you will have absolutely no visibility out your back glass or your rearview mirror (which should be obvious to others experienced with this product type but possibly something not realized by all).All and all, this bag is worth its purchase price, but if you have the money to spend a hard box would be better for safety and save you some gas money if you are driving very far.",1349136000,2012-10-02

I see why people have given ratings here saying it is hard to get undone.  Because it can be very hard to undo this latch.  The reason is because it will metal clip sometimes not go in to the lock correctly then it becomes very hard to get it undone.  The problem simply is the latch part is hard to get in to the lock part.  I often think I have it right and only have one side of it in the lock the other is not in.  Most of the time when this happens I end up threading the strap back out of the metal piece that clips in to the lock.

4.0,"The Duracell DPP-600HD Powerpack does serve several uses - some of which it performs above all expectations. However, it is important to remember that it is essentially a giant battery and NOT a generator.One of my complaints is that the unit has a built in monitoring device that provides feedback on the amount of remaining power in the battery. Unfortunately, that feature did not work on mine. I am not sure if my unit is defective... but the display console is essentially useless.PROS-- Will power a cordless phone, modem and router for about 8 hours. We have our phone service through the internet - so when our power is out we lose everything.- It can charge your car battery... in a pinch. I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure that if your car battery wasn't all the way dead the Duracell Powerpack could get you going!- Nice built in flash light and radio. Not of huge use - but in the dark they are nice to have.- Surge protector on the unit - things that pull too much juice will not even come on (like my wife's hair dryer)Cons-- VERY HEAVY - I haven't weighed it but the Duracell Powerpack probably tips the scale at about 25-30lbs. Any many cases it would be too heavy for a women or the elderly.- It is severely limited in the number of amps that you can pull. Again, my wife's hair dryer pulled to many amos - and therefore - would not come on. This severely restricts its use during a power outage. As a rule of thumb only low powered appliances can be plugged in.At the end of the day - for the cost - you could throw in a little more money and buy a generator. While the Duracell Powerpack is silent and does not produces any dangerous fumes it is limited in what you can operate. My recommendation - nice to have in an emergency - but it is not a cure-all if you happen to be out of power. 4 stars.",1204934400,2008-03-08

5.0,"This is not your normal vehicle wax, nor does it apply like normal wax. The end result is basically the same. There are a few tricks to make it easier to apply.Test Vehicle: White Subaru ForesterWhite has to be the hardest vehicle to wax. You hardly see dried wax. With ICE you really don't see anything.I applied the ICE as directed. I covered all paint, rubber, lenses, and trim. I didn't touch any glass.The applicator works well. You need to keep the applicator slightly damp, but not dripping wet.After wiping down the Subaru I waited 10 minutes. Maybe I waited a little longer than recommended, but it didn't hurt the end result.Next, you wipe the entire vehicle down with one side of the micro fiber towel. This is crucial! You'll notice some streaking on black plastic and rubber trim. This step gives you time to work everything in.The last step uses the ""clean"" side of the micro fiber towel. Here's where you notice how good ICE really is. No dust. No residue. No white haze. No nothing. Literally amazing!Make sure you buff out EVERY area you covered with the ICE. No elbow grease is required. Just wipe everything down with the clean side.Time: 30 minutes from start to finish. I imagine it will be quicker in the future, but I was using a new product and took my time.Stand back and admire your vehicle. My Subaru looks great!",1182988800,2007-06-28

Accessing my R1200RT rear tire's valve is a bit difficult with the panniers and double brake discs.  This looked like a good buy.Highlights1.  Seems accurate.

Sure, that makes it light and probably cheap to make, but I suspect that 90 bend is going to be a problem.  You might torque it a bit getting it off the valve stem, which might break it.

There is no audible beep when it captures the pressure.  But, it's something I'll just have to accept.Overall, for the price, it appears to be a very well designed gauge for a motorcyclist.  Interestingly, I tried it on my car, and the angle precluded me from using it with the numbers facing me.This gauge isn't perfect, but it's pretty nice.

5.0,"I've got a 2008 prius with leather seats, and I'm pretty sure the last time it got a good going-over was a car wash in 2009. While I typically keep the windows up, I also live in a rural area in drought, so with all the dirt roads, there is always a ton of dust. So I had a pretty dirty job ahead of me.I used the cleaner and the cushy microfiber cloths on the textured dash, doors, console, and leather seats, and the combination of cleaner and cloths did an excellent job cleaning and conditioning every surface. It was quick, easy work. I was really impressed at how little effort and how little product I had to use.After cleaning the leather (and frankly, I was surprised at how beatifully the same leaner for the grimy dash worked on the leather--it even removed some kind of residue I was sure was a stain on the leather armrest), I used the conditioner on the leather, spraying directly on the solid leather and with a cloth on the perforated leather, as directed.It all looks awesome. The only thing not covered is the glass, which of course got streaky and needs a shot of windex.The cloths are really nice, not the cheap, thin microfiber you usually see. And the scent is very light, not at all bothersome even though I was using it in a closed car.",1361145600,2013-02-18
5.0,I used to use RTV to help hold my gaskets down. Only issue with that is the next time you change the gasket you have to scrape all the RTV off to make sure you have a clean mounting surface for the next new gasket. Worse is that is you get to aggressive with your razor or gasket scraper you can scrape or gouge small scratches in the metal mating surfaces requiring you to have to use some type of RTV to help the new gasket seal the scratches you just left in the metal or risk leaks making their way through the scrapes you left behind. Get this and put a thin coat on the pan and the gasket give it a few min to set up and you'll be good. The gasket will stay in place and you will not have to worry about the gasket shifting or worse having to drop the pan again because the bolt holes for all the holes are covered by a shifting gasket.,1342396800,2012-07-16

4.0,"I bought two sets of these for a 2005 Nissan Maxima.  (I always like to have matching wiper spares on hand.)After a couple weeks of use I have so far been very pleased with them.  They were very easy to attach to the wiper arms on my car, and do a better job of removing water from the windshield than the original OEM spring wiper blade assembly.  I really should have switched to this sort of design sooner.As this part of Texas doesn't get snow to any degree, (and I avoid driving for the single day every three years when snow actually accumulates) I cannot speak of their performance in winter conditions.  Just based on the feel and slight flimsiness of the design, I suspect that these wouldn't work well in areas with very heavy snow.  The wipers wouldn't 'dig in' well.  However a heavier design would probably perform poorly for my needs: removing every trace of water from the windshield during heavy downpour of LIQUID water.For the above reason I have to deduct a single star.  They aren't truly All Season Wipers for most of the continental United States.One last note, due to where I live, wipers don't last very long.  100 F temperatures, gritty dust, and a lot of direct sun tend to destroy them.  I'll write back and modify this review if they last for less than a year.  A year or more would be satisfactory for me.",1300752000,2011-03-22

I tried this on several heavy chrome components of a 1960s pinball machine  as well as the heavy brass 1910 designs of the Cutler Mail company (mail chutes). No use of the Dremel or other electric buffing components was necessary. Simple handwork did the job and I ended up being able to rescue a number of items that looked quite time-worn. 2.5 ounces doesn't sound like a lot, but you need so little for any one job that it's plenty (unless, of course, you're working on large components such as the chrome bumpers or wheels of a car).",1367712000,2013-05-05

Hold the air pocket trigger and start pumping .  It primed very easy and stayed primed with both bottles of grease I used.  The trigger does take some force but no more than any other gun I've used.

5.0,The filter fit my 2007 Honda Accord perfectly.  The baking soda and activated carbon really do a good job of making the interior of the car fresh smelling.  I have tried other brands of cabin air filters but this one is definitely the best I have tried.  I really liked the fact that the filter came with installation directions.

5.0,"I like that you can shut off the flow out the funnel.  This is handy because if you know the amount of oil needed, say 20 ounces in your lawn mower, you can measure 20 ounces by the markings on the funnel, open the valve with a quick twist, and watch it go in.  It even has a little screen at the outlet to keep any debris that might get in there, from getting into your engine.A lid for the top, and a cap on the end of the hose, keeps the dust out when not in use.  The flex tube going down is easily flexed, but can kink if bent too sharply.

5.0,"Every once in awhile you stumble upon a product that you know you'll be buying for as long as they make it - this is one of those products.Permatex Grez-Off is primarily a degreaser for tools and other equipment.  It has a notation on the bottle not to use it on glass or motorcycles - not sure why, but won't be testing it out on them either.  The directions say to spray on and leave it a few seconds before wiping and rinsing off.  'Do not allow to dry' is also on the directions.After a quick check of the bottle I set out to test-drive this product in my home for the Amazon Vine Reviewer Program, and this is what I found:Test #1: In my kitchen.  A greasy ledge that holds nic-nacks, but is rarely wiped down.  Other cleaners I've used have taken a lot of elbow grease to get it clean, and frankly it always seems to have a greasy film no matter what I've used. *Another bio-degradable product we've used (Simple Green) never worked this well and had a much stronger odor.*I sprayed Permatex Grez-Off on the ledge after removing the stuff and didn't even wait 2 seconds before wiping it off with a damp cloth.  AMAZING!  Worked great and I didn't have to really even rub, just wiped it off - rinsed the cloth and wiped it down again.  Done in seconds and done well.  GRADE: A+Test #2: In my bathroom.  The vinyl flooring in my bathroom is cream colored, but you'd never know it due to the sticky hairspray residue that gathers on it and collects dirt.  I've gotten down on my hands and knees to scrub it with Ajax powder and other assorted cleaners, but it's never come out looking like new - until now.The Permatex Grez-Off indicates 'do not put on plastic'.  I wasn't sure if this would qualify, so I sprayed a small test area, wiped it and then rinsed it.  It looked good with little effort, so I did the whole floor the same way. Virtually no scrubbing needed and the floor did come out looking darn near new!  I was thrilled. Again, I'd not left the spray on the surface for all but a second or two before wiping.  No need to let it sit to get things clean - at least not there.  GRADE: A+**NOTE: you will want to make sure you have proper ventilation while using this product.  It DOES have an odor and while not overpowering, some will find it strong.  You may also want to wear rubber gloves while using it as it does dry out your hands when you don't.Test #3: The sticky, greasy BBQ.  Left outside for three seasons uncovered, the gas BBQ needed a cleaning, but the few times I'd tried it too way too much effort and the products didn't clean it well.  I took the Permatex Grez-Off to it and within less than 5 minutes it looked shiny and clean.  Again, amazing stuff that does what it promises it will do. GRADE: A+The bottom line: if you need a good all-purpose degreaser/cleaner - BUY IT!  It's great and you'll use it to clean lots of things inside and outside; on boats, RV's, cars, in the garage and inside your home.",1309392000,2011-06-30

I filled the tanks a bit so they weren't used &#34;dry&#34; and we really only used the toilet a few times. I drained the tank once each evening and then refilled to about 1/3 full to keep fluid in the tank.When it was time to go, I drained the black tank, and watched the waste pass by in the clear elbow thinking that it looked about right, but I figured I'd try a back flush anyway. I was surprised to see that I got as much or more out after the first flush then simply draining it alone. Then again, I figured surely there couldn't be a need to flush a new tank twice, but I tried it anyway, and again was surprised to see more waste flush by. Then of course, I just had to see if a third time would net the same results, and I again saw more stuff fly by. My fourth flush on a new tank that was lightly used for two days finally came clear.I'm convinced and wouldn't think of owning a camper without this tool.",1400716800,2014-05-22

I wouldn't buy just one per vehicle.  I'd buy several.  The magnetic feature is very handy.  But the key is getting your vehicle off the road as far as possible so emergency lighting is not as important.  If you can't I'd use emegegency flashers and get back to your vehicle ASAP.

5.0,"I'm quite impressed at how good this product worked.  I have a black car and some careless idiot slammed their white car door into mine, leaving a series of marks.  I bought some Scratch X because it had gotten mainly good reviews and tried it.  The label simply says to rub it on with a terry cloth, let dry, then buff away, if it were only that easy!  For Scratch X to work you need to apply it to a soft cloth (I used an old tshirt) and rub AGAINST the scratch until it (the Scratch X, not the actual scratch!) disappears on the area.  Apply more Scratch X and keep repeating this step until the scratch is nearly gone (it took me about 5 times).  After that, turn the same cloth (in my case a tshirt) over and buff the residue away.  I applied quite a bit of pressure to the area and as you could imagine my arm and wrist became quite tired by the time I was finished, but it was indeed worth it.

3.0,"I bought this at a local auto zone to carry used coolant to the recycler.  For any fluid change in a car, it's important to measure how much you take out so you know if you're putting enough back in (or if you got enough out).  Thus, buying a clear or translucent container with fill level markings would be a much better idea for most jobs.  Unfortunately I didn't think of that when I bought this.The wide opening is great but the lid is terrible and not water or oil tight.  It's also annoying to screw and unscrew as the part that joins the lid to the base will scrape past the handle of the container on every turn.Other reviewers said the plastic seems thin but I don't get that impression.

Failure to do so according to the manufacture instructions can damage the item.It seems to be very durable and perfect for the good Samaritan or the stranded guy or gal at the side of the road.I will give more information as I use this device.I hope this review helps and please give it a thumbs up if it helped you. Thanks.",1360454400,2013-02-10

3.0,"Lexol 3-in-1 Leather Care Spray - 16 oz.I've used Lexol cleaner and Lexol conditioner in the past on all of my genuine leather articles. These included leather steering wheel wraps, leather shoes, leather boots, motorcycle racing leathers, and anything with leather. The Lexol conditioner always made the leather feel soft and supple, and I never have any complaints.The Lexol 3-in-1 is supposed to make things easier by combining their separate products into 1, so you can spray and wipe. I found the 3-in-1 to be easier to use because the liquid is thinner and less viscous so it seeps into stitching and porous material more readily. Unfortunately, it also leaves a sheen on some leather surfaces and makes it feel slick to the touch. I also noticed that it turned some leather ""stiffer"" or ""harder"" than when I used Lexol conditioner. The odor is also very unruly, it no longer made my leather articles smell like leather, but instead it smelled unnaturally.The cleaning power is about on-par with the Lexol cleaner, but I did not like how the 3-in-1 left a sheen on the leather surfaces and made some of the leather surfaces feel slicker and stiffer. The smell was not very good either. I would be hesitant to use the 3-in-1 on steering wheel wraps and seats because of the slick feel. I wouldn't mind using the 3-in-1 on leather dashboard surfaces or boots/shoes , although I still prefer the separate Lexol products.Overall: 3/5 stars",1320192000,2011-11-02

4.0,"... there are other tools that work just as good, if not better, for half or even less then the price of this.Plain and simple this is a great roller, the rubber head doesn't cut or tear into the foil backing of the sound deadening mat and really helps you put good even pressure to hard to reach areas. That and it saves wear and tear on your hands.But like I said there are cheaper alternatives like a super cheap wallpaper seam roller (you can find some with a rubber or wooden roller) or my personal favoritea ""J"" roller. With the J roller you can use the roller or even the curved handle to apply pressure to the sound deadening mat. You can even use old roller skate/blade wheels.So to recap:Great toolSaves your hands from a ton of wear and tearWorks greatBUT other tools/items can be had that do the same thing for much less.",1197676800,2007-12-15

5.0,"I've had a good experience with these ramps. They're easy to line up, wide enough to provide confidence, and they seem plenty strong. They're light enough to be very easy to lift and move around.These ramps are not hollow shells; they have supports on the inside. Because of this, you cannot place one ramp inside the other for storage.It took a few times for me to get used to driving up these ramps.  Let's face it, driving up an incline in your garage is not something you are probably used to.  The second time I did it, my tires hit the raised lip on the ramp (the one designed to stop the wheels) pretty hard.  When it did this, it made a loud noise, and I suffered a moment of terror before I realized that nothing was wrong.I decided it would be much easier to drive up these ramps if I could see what I was doing.  So, I bought a cheap full-length mirror at Target (the kind designed to be mounted on the inside of a bedroom door).  Now when I use these ramps, I set the mirror down on my garage floor lengthwise, leaning against the wall, adjusted so I can see my front driver-side tire the whole time.  This has made it vastly easier to drive up the ramps with confidence--and without killing my transmission. The same trick also makes backing down the ramps easier. It's important to be going extremely slowly at the point when the tires leave the ramps and make first contact with the floor. If you're going too fast, the suspension will bounce, which (depending on the vehicle) could damage something when the underside of the vehicle hits the higher portion of the ramps.",1297296000,2011-02-10
5.0,"Replaced all the interior lights on a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

Unfortunately, with this particular vehicle, the map lights are not bulbs that can be replaced.  They are already LED lights, but they are warm 2,700 kelvin lights and these are 6,000 or 7,000 kelvin (bright white).  You have to cut off the old map lights, and re-solder the individual LEDs from this kit back onto the ribbon cable for them to match.

4.0,"3-IN-ONE  No-Rust ShieldHonestly, this is a difficult product to review without doing a controlled experiment to determine if it is working:  if there is rust, it isn't working but if there is no rust, it may or may not be working.3-IN-ONE has a large stake in maintaining their excellent reputation--the same company also sells trusted products such as WD-40 and Lava soap.  So this is the rare situation where I would be willing to trust the manufacturer that the product works.I can say that after about a month in my toolbox, there does not appear to be new rust forming on the tools that have rusted in the past.  Average humidity here for that month is in the 60%-70% range and the storage area was not air conditioned.The product is basically a piece of sponge that holds the chemicals encased in a plastic shell that may be attached to a surface with the strip of 3M Command tape on the back.I did a great deal of research on what to me was a novel and interesting product.  Vapor Phase Corrosion Inhibitors are a tried-and-true method of preventing rust.  An excellent overview paper may be found on the website of the professional organization of corrosion engineers:  [...]The exact formulation of this product is not given by the manufacturer.  When I called their customer service number, I was referred to the MSDS which lists only polyurethane foam and ""proprietary ingredients"".The manufacturer recommends one unit for every two cubic feet of space.  On the manufacturer's website, the diagram in the demo slideshow showed dimensions of 2' x 2' x 2' which is eight cubic feet.  I explained this error to the very pleasant customer service representative and said that I would be checking back to see if it was corrected.  I am very pleased to report that it has since been corrected and my conclusion is that the company is responsive to consumers and is diligent about the integrity of their products and marketing.  Yes, that is impressive and all-too-rare these days.The product is activated when it is removed from the packaging so you should not open it until you are ready to use it.  (The button on front you push activates the timer only, not the product.)It is stated to last up to 90 days.  On the company's website you can sign up for an emailed replacement reminder when it is time to replace the product.  This is a clever marketing ploy but it is also very useful to the consumer.  The website is very informative and worth taking a look at if you are considering purchasing the product.  I would also not hesitate to call customer service with questions.  [...]I would recommend this product as useful for protecting valuable items prone to rust that are stored for moderate to long periods of time in small enclosed containers.  Other reviewers have pointed out that there are other methods of rust prevention that are more appropriate in other situations but it is a good product for the intended use.",1253145600,2009-09-17

Still though, this is an essential part for anyone with a Hi Lift jack.",1365033600,2013-04-04
1.0,"I'm a car buff and do most of my own mechanical work and all my own detailing.  We have a fairly new Accord, (1 year old) that I thought it might be nice to protect the front bumper on.  I'm familiar with the 3M clear bra system from professionals and it is very, very good but expensive.  So here comes what I think is the same product in a DIY format.First, you need to really prepare the surface for this product.  Not just wash the car but wash, clay, machine clean, polish (but NOT wax) and make sure it is absolutely baby butt smooth and that there is no dirt or debris residing on the surface.  However, even after doing all this, I still had dust on the surface by time I masked off the rest of the front end.  So my first attempt was way less then perfect so I thought I'll just peel it off and try again - wrong!  The easy peel nature of this product is a fiction - it's a mess to remove and will try your patience.I threw the rest of the product away and figured if I really wanted the protection, I'd go to the professionals and pay $300 for a 3M clear bra treatment which I understand is very, very good and very durable.  Some things are just better left to the professionals and this falls squarely into that category for me.",1389225600,2014-01-09

5.0,"Being a wrench-head for over 45 years, I keep a few cars around to use at the appropriate seasons. I try and keep them charged up to avoid the costly $100 batteries. I have tried many makes and even other Black and Decker models. This model has been the best and lasts as long as you car does if you use it right. My brand new truck today sits with a built-in little B&D; BM3B colorful charger to avoid drainage. When you connect these chargers, do not expect them to charge your battery from Zero volts. Best performance is when a battery has medium charge in it so the 1-2 Amp current can be fed slowly. You will see the orange light for a day or two then here comes the green light which is great news.When you store an older car (60's-70's) for a long time, disconnect the battery (-ve and +ve_) both and hook up to charger, in newer cars (80's plus) you will lose the settings and the memory so it is best to connect the charger +ve lead to the battery and the -ve lead to a good ground like the alternator frame.This is a wonderful device and I have 3 of them running on my project cars and will get one for the yard tractor soon.",1383782400,2013-11-07

Do yourself a favor and don't buy this it's junk. P.S it's 3/12 Amp not 3/6/12 Amp. This charger works if you have a battery that is weak but if your battery is under 9 volts you have to keep unplugging it and start over and over until it reaches a threshold to maintain it.

I can quickly and easily switch antennas on my car without the use of tools.I had this on my Wrangler for month (January in Colorado - road salt and all) and noticed when I took the antenna off for the car wash that rust had started to form on the base stud.  Since this device provides an important electrical contact, you can't just spray it down with WD-40.  I ended up using a no-residue rust inhibitor called Safari Charlie Gun Lube.  This is a fantastic product with a residue free solvent that removes rust handily. I don't know the details, but they claim it leaves an electrostatic charge at the surface of the material it protects. I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.

We've been so happy with it that we decided to buy two more... one for our Husqvarna garden tractor and one for our Bad Boy zero turn mower.At the price I paid ($17), these chargers are an excellent value. They come with both one bolt on battery connection that you leave on the battery, but disconnect at the cord, and a set of spring clamps. The clamps are handy for charging a battery that is unexpectedly low, and the bolt on connectors stay on the battery you plan on maintaining over time with the charger.Operation is simple... hook this little charger up to your batter and forget about it.

5.0,"This is the best carnauba wax I've used so far. I have used Meguiar's and Mother's brand waxes before, and while they are good, this is much better. This is also the first time I've used a paste wax and I think I've been converted to this type. Application of this product is easy, and the best part is it doesn't need to dry to a haze before being buffed off. Makes things go faster and buffing it off is easier when not dry. It also doesn't smell like petroleum distillates which is great. The shine left behind is great, and I did test it's water beading by pouring some water on the hood of my car. This wax passed my little ""test"".I don't drive a car that costs well into the six figures so I won't be using car care products that cost $100+ for a small bottle or container. This wax is certainly much more expensive than the other brands I had been using, but it's also about the limit of what I'd personally spend. It looks like this tin will last a good while so that's a plus. Also, I used this wax on my table saw's top and it performed beautifully for that role as well. I am slowly being swayed to the Griot's Garage brand products as every one of them I've used so far has been great, and performed very well.Edit:I REALLY like this wax. I washed, clay bared, and waxed my car a few months ago. I washed it once after waxing, and washed again recently, thinking I'd need to reapply the wax. I clay bared the car after washing and was amazed how clean the clay was. Crud wasn't really sticking to the car either as I'd gone through through the washing. I applied a spray wax instead of this wax since it was faster and easier. Wow, with all the other waxes I've used they never last this long or perform this well after a couple months in the sun, with two washes, and lots of dirt. Superb.",1366502400,2013-04-21

Saturn says that it's a lifetime fill on the transmission but I felt much more comfortable changing it out at 100,000 miles with a synthetic. I feel like I will never have to worry about it again.Just like some other people stated the old fluid did come out looking suprisingly clean. I tossed in just shy of 2 quarts of the D4 fluid and tightened everything back down. It was fast and easy to do, I used a pry between the engine and transmission to get the drain bolt. Then used loktite on the bolts going back in as the manual suggests.I could not tell a difference but my girlfriend said she could. She claimed everything was smoother. Usually she gets about 300 miles per tank and she's been getting just over that now. I can't say that's due to the fluid but it's the only numbers I can supply.I am very happy with the swap I did and I would continue to use this fluid in the future if I had an application that called for it.",1342742400,2012-07-20

5.0,"Update 5/4/2013: I finally needed to replace these -- in October 2012!  That's more than two years after I installed the original blades!  Not bad for blades that ""should"" be replaced every six months.Updated 12/31/2011:  I still have the same blades on my car, and they still wipe as good as the day I installed them!  I can't believe they're lasting this long!I ordered this wiper, along with theAutoTex ""PINK"" - Black Metal Wiper Blade - 19"" , Pack of 1, for my 2008 Hyundai Sonata.It was very easy to replace my old wipers with these, except for one exception (which isn't the fault of this blade, but my old blade assembly and my arthritic fingers). With age, the old connector was difficult to pry open.  I don't expect this problem when my blades need to be replaced again (because I plan on replacing these every 6 months).The instructions claim these wiper blades take five minutes to replace.  That's way more than I needed.  I think it took me a couple minutes to replace BOTH blades.The best praise I can give for these blades?  When I took my car into the shop for an oil change, the mechanic told me that these were really high quality wipers.  It takes a lot to impress my mechanic, but these blades did it!  When my wipers need replacing again (about every six months is recommended), I'll use these AutoTex ""PINK"" Premium Wiper Blades again.",1284595200,2010-09-16
3.0,"At first glance the high quality of the materials and construction makes this seem like a very nice bag.The design however is a bit baffling.  As shipped, the side handles come inside the side straps. (making it difficult to use the handles until you take it apart and reassemble it ""correctly"") What purpose do the side straps serve?There is no handle on the top, so if you are going to carry this somewhere it is a ""two hand"" job using the side handles.  This is not your typical luggage bag.The basic idea is that this bag is normally collapsed and thus takes up almost no space.  However the metal supports, which are used to prop the bag in the open position, have nothing to secure them in the open position and thus the bag tends to collapse frequently.

5.0,"This is a great kit either as gift or for yourself for taking care of your car.I bought one when we got our last new car and bought another one for my Dad when he just bought a car.It covers washing, waxing and has an in-between spray that will protect the car in between washes and waxes when you just need a quick clean-up to make the car look nice and protect it from harsh weather.Car wash is good, no heavy residue. Mitt is really nice.  The tire shine workes really well and lasts for a day or so.  The wax is really good and long lasting.  Easy to apply and not too bad to buff off either.  Most heavily utilized was the detailer though -- great for fast clean-ups when no time to wash and wax.I recommend pairing this kit with the microfiber towels -- great for drying or applying the detailer -- for a full kit.the only way I would improve it is to include an interior cleaner as well -- but you can buy that separate also.All in all, great value, makes a nice gift and gives you a one-stop item for exterior care of your car.",1365984000,2013-04-15

4.0,"I apologize for the delayed review.  I actually bought this kit for my dad who resides in Malaysia.  I recently made a trip back, so I thought it was a good idea to get him the HID kit so he can see better at night.  This kit was going into his Mercedes 200.  Okay, on to the review...The presentation of the box is very nice, but it is made of cheap material.  However, the product itself is packed nicely in the box, and the construction of the box is made well enough to protect the Bulb, ballast and wiring.  To save on luggage space, I discarded the box.  I bubble wrapped the parts and sandwiched them between my clothing.  They survived the journey half way around the world.  The instructions leaflet was actually very helpful...especially the graphic depictions.  The installation is straight-forward.  We managed to get the new kit working in under 30 minutes.  Tidying up the cables were a whole different story! :)The light are much much brighter than the OEM H4 bulbs.  HOWEVER, for some reason, one of the 6K bulb was a &#34;tad&#34; bit more yellowish than the other.  My dad did not really notice it.  He was more excited to see how much brighter his lights were.  The other complaint was the high beam.  I think the bulb for the high beam is not sufficient with this setup, but since he drives in town mostly, that's not a big issue.Overall, this Kensun kit looks like a quality product.  The cables are well constructed, and the ballast are well built.  They don't look like the cheap e-bay versions, and this HID does not flicker.  However, for those of you who need Hi-beam with your H4, you might want to look at their bi-xenon conversion kit...",1372291200,2013-06-27
5.0,"the wax smelled GREAT!! I doubt they put any fragrance in it -- it just smelled so (faintly) flowery, perhaps like the tree it came from. Anyway, after getting thru that olfactory experience, I reveled in the sight of that beautiful flat plane of Carnauba wax and then got to work.I took a square of cheesecloth, folded it into eighths, rubbed a decent shmear of wax onto it and then using flat strokes, I waxed an area about 14 inches by 3, immediately buffing it with another folded square of cheesecloth to bring out the gloss and keep it from drying and turning white on my dark finish. I also added a fine mist from a spray bottle to further enhance the shine.THIS takes time and patience, and must be done (IMHO) in the shade for best results,  but the reward is great -- I can't wait to see how this finish looks in the rain! UPDATE- it rained and the water beaded up in little round beads of varying impressive shapes -- I realized however that each bead in the sunlight is like a magnifying glass which will intensify the sun's rays on my finish, so a wipe with a dry and thirsty beach towel helped remove most of the water beads (have no chamois right now). That would actually apply to any kind of wax job, and Griot's is no exception.Now my paint job is not the best, thanks to the local Auto Paint shop. But while using Griot's Garage 11029 Premium Carnauba Paste Wax I could actually SEE the metalflake in the paint come back to life.So I did the car, segments at a time, unfolding and using the same eight-fold square of cheesecloth about 4 times before discarding it. I took me a long time to wax the whole car, but it IS worth it. The chrome (the parts that were not rusted) gleamed. I need to get some steel wool and take care of the surface rust on the bumpers before waxing them any further -- however, the wheel trim (chrome) rings sparkled.I would think one can would be sufficent for about 3 applications, maybe less on a larger car. I store the can (which BTW opens and closes easily) in a cool spot close to room temperature.The price? WELL worth it.",1367020800,2013-04-27

Simply unscrew the ""fin"", place the folded tarp material (it helps if an edge is used with the sewn hem included in the fold for security purposes) in the jaws, tighten and repeat on another edge close to the corner.  Use a decent quality tie-down rope or strong rope material.I tested the Clips with my riding mower covered with good old blue tarp material.  The winds and rain beat the daylights out of the tarp and the ProGrips held as if they were a part of the mower.  The mower did not get wet and the Clips held without permitting water or wind to get in.

5.0,"!UPDATE! 8/22/2011After doing some yard work I wanted to give all of the equipment a good cleaning, this included the lawnmower, string trimmer, and a few other tools. After spending several minutes scrubbing on the string trimmer and getting nowhere with the caked on pulverized grass that NOTHING seems to be able to touch, I saw the Grez-Off bottle sitting there... so I gave it a shot. Sprayed it on, waited three minutes, hosed it off and wallah! It was clean! I've never found a single product that worked this well at removing the caked on grass/stains. Just for this use it is well worth the price!Time for me to bump this up from four stars to five stars!!UPDATE!When it comes to degreasers there are WAY too many choices. Some extremely chemically, others on the ""green"" side of things. Some work well, others not. Permatex's Grez-Off I am glad to report is both!On a scale of 1-10, here is how I would rank Grez-Off.Old grease 2 months and older: 4I have several old grease stains/areas in the garage and on the driveway. I applied it full strength and let it sit several minutes to do it's magic. The really old stains, it barely touched. The stains that were fairly new, around 2 months old, it removed it fairly easily. With the aid of a pressure washer the older stains came up even more so vs. just the pressure washer.New grease: 9For spot treating and cleaning tools it worked AWESOMELY! Very little work involved and left the tools and spots really clean.The smell is not unpleasant or harsh, just kind of run of the miss degreaser smelling.The pump bottle works well. I don't know how many times I've had pump bottles break or stop working before I've even used 1/3 of the bottle.Grez-Off has made such an impression I've added it to my arsenal of cleaning products.

If you like the Evo's you can save some cash by buying Marathons instead.I cannot personally testify about anything except the Icons witch are fantastic blades. Its the only line I have used. I think the only advertised difference is the longevity between the Icon/Evo lines but if wally worlds price for the Evo equivalent Marathons are low enough on my next trip around I'll try them. There does however seem to be better reviews on Amazon with Icons but I was just glad to find wipers that lasted yrs again instead of just months like other brands ended up doing for me. Hope I helped save a few bucks for someone here.BTW: When installing these beam blades make sure the higher ridge on the frame is up. You should be able to read Bosch. If Bosch is upside down then flip the blade around. While looking at the end the blade, its like a scoop to catch air. It should appear like this ( and not backwards like this ). The higher ridge acts like a spoiler on the rear of a car and catches wind to force it downward onto the glass while driving. I read on some reviews were people discovered they mounted them backwards and the blade lifted instead.===Question to Bosch===Are the Bosch Marathon wipers sold at Walmart stores the same blade as bosch Icons?

5.0,"Okay, so a bit of background is probably in order. In our younger years, the spouse and self used to go tent camping but as we aged, sleeping on the ground, dealing with the weather and so forth lost some of its appeal. We opted to trade up to a small travel trailer which provided some of the comforts of home with easy access and set -up when out and about.It was a terrific plan and everything has gone smoothly except for one aspect...sanitation. There are no words to describe my level of hatred and disgust for everything sanitation related. It's so bad that most of the time I select  a campground based upon the availability to full service showers/bathrooms etc...of course, I hate public showers/bathrooms nearly as much as the sanitation issue so it's been of little help.My solution was to buy disposable everything...especially the hose. No, they aren't truly disposable which makes it somewhat expensive as I simply refused to re-use anything after having to dump. My spouse, a much more practical person, has complained that my buying disposable (ie cheap) products makes it worse since the quality leaves a lot to be desired.When this came up for review it was an absolute no-brainer. He loves the hose...I'm dubious about keeping one after it's been used but he assures me it will be bleached, rinsed and stored in its very own plastic bag. Despite my misgivings, he claims this hose is far superior as it has its own support system to help with emptying, a sprayer to help clean a bit more, gloves (we own boxes but still this is nice to have as a kit), the chemical treatment (again, we already have some but as a kit this works well). The really nice thing is the hose and attachments which make this stand out from the rest. This hose is able to shrink down or elongate, it has twisting connectors that make it simple to position and situate, the hose is a good length and sturdy.Spouse was absolutely delighted by this set. We've bought each of these items independently and spent more so the value seems in keeping especially given the quality of the hose and related attachments.",1383782400,2013-11-07
5.0,"Following the directions in the accompanying manual, I was able to use this device to scan the codes in my car's computer and read my vehicle's VIN. Although the nearby Pep Boys shop will run a FREE scan for me, having a scanner of my own is much more convenient and I can see the results myself without having them &#34;interpreted&#34; by the mechanic.The dealer where I bought my car new won't hook up a scanner for less than $100. This little gadget will certainly save me some bucks because I can identify the problem myself and have a good idea of what kind of repairs may be necessary before I take my car to the shop. If you have detected a problem and have fixed it yourself, you can reset the code that causes your engine light to come on. Not only does it scan the codes on my car, it also scans the codes on my Winnebago Itasca Sunova Model 33C motorhome. This scanner will be accompanying me during my travels in my coach to help us sniff out any troubles that come up.For anybody who wants to know what is going on with his or her car or other compatible vehicle, this scan tool is a reasonably-priced way to become informed.I was provided a free sample of this device in exchange for an honest review, which you have just read.",1401840000,2014-06-04

5.0,"Maybe since I park my car inside my headlights weren't too bad, but they were getting a tiny bit frosted so I decided to head it off at the pass.  The first step with the gold sanding pad is the key to a successful outcome.  You have to sand off everything you want to get rid of in this step because the remaining steps are just to minimize then buff out those scratches.  I should have been more aggressive with the first (gold) step, but I was scared of doing something I couldn't undo.  When you start sanding and your headlight gets frosted you think that it will never be right again.  Trust me, spend some time with that first step and use all of your sanding discs to get rid of all of the haze and pits.  Then, follow the remaining steps per the directions and your headlights will be beautiful again.  Use this kit when you have some time to dedicate to it.

4.0,"Dickies Heavy Duty Black Rear Bench Seat Cover was what I expected.  It is made of heavy polyester material that should wear very well.

Having used seat covers in the past, I was very much aware of how difficult they are to install and get to stay in place and this one is no exception.  After making some alteration, I was finally able to get this to look and function ok.  I had to slit the seat belt slots to make them fit the ones in my old truck but this was a simple alteration.  Then the one addition was to add a small bungie cord to keep the tension on the back of the seat and two other bungie cords to keep the tension on the bottom sides.  These were easy to do and now my old vinyl seat is warmer and should last longer.  The cover is priced right and looks good.

5.0,"I drive a 2010 VW Jetta 2.0TSI. This car has the oil filter on top of the engine which makes using an oil extractor for oils changes a very good idea. I dont know why some reviewers have had problems with this oil extractor. I used this as soon as it arrived and it worked perfect! I even did an oil change wearing a whit polo and khakis and did not get dirty at all! Here was my process:1. Drove car until it reached normal temp (not the 5 mintues suggested in instructions)2. Removed engine top cover.3. Remove dipstick4. Put oil extractor hose into dipstick tube until it stopped5. Pumped extractor until I got resistance on the pump handle6. About halfway through, I removed the oil filter and oil cap7. When I got nothing but air I filled it back up with Pentosin HPII 5W40 (highly recommend for VW)8. Replaced oil filter and dipstick9. Cleaned extractorThis whole process took no more than 20 minutes, including having to entertain my 3 year old son (he likes to help dad fix the car).

5.0,Ive used competitive brands but this one is the best.  I have a 4 cycle outboard the is E85 rated and it still didn't run good on 10% methanol fuel.  I asked the lobster fishermen and a few mechanics when this brand first came out  and unanimously they recommended it over any other.  I had a 2 cycle mini tiller that I inherited and it had sat for 2 years.  I put some of this in the tank with some fresh gas and had to play with the choke for a while to get enough treated fuel through the carb but once I did it ran perfect.  Left it all winter and this spring it started on the 2nd pull and ran great.  The outboard starts on the first pull even the first start of the season.  The car had a hitch in it so I added an 1/8 of a cup to it and next time I used the car the hitch was gone.  I could continue but suffice it to say I put this in all my gas engines from my 1959 bulldozer to my new Harley.  I use it for winterization and occasional use in vehicles.  I use it all the time for stored gas and engines that only get used once and a while.,1378944000,2013-09-12

It works pretty well now with a direct connection to the battery, especially if the car/motorcycle engine is running.With that modification, this little pump is fine for bicycle and motorcycle tires and for topping off a slightly low car tire, but I wouldn't want to use it to fully inflate a full-sized car or truck tire from beginning to end. The little pump gets pretty hot after a couple of minutes.The gauge on mine is fairly accurate, close enough to be considered reliable.Before I modified the power connector, it continually blew fuses, and, after putting in a stronger fuse, the connection got exceedingly hot after only a few minutes of use.

5.0,"The house I live in didn&#8217;t have much in the way of outdoor lighting when I moved in. With one dual-light spotlight in front yard and one single-light spotlight in the backyard, most of the yard was dark. Having built a patio out back last year, one of my priorities was fixing the lighting situation. I put one solar spotlight on the patio, but the other side of the backyard still need something. I opted for the Sunforce 82080 80-LED Solar Motion Light.With this light, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about running electrical to that side of the house, which made installation a lot easier. I also like that the solar feature means this light won&#8217;t add to my electric bill.I don&#8217;t have a drill that goes into brick, so my neighbor helped me install it using his drill. He installed the solar panel on the end of the house that gets full sun all day, and put the light itself around the corner where it could light up half the backyard. The long cable between the solar panel and the light means you can put the solar panel someplace different than the light if the light is to be hung in a shady area.We had some burglaries in our neighborhood a few months ago, and so one of the things that drew me to this light was the motion detection feature. My hope is that if the light comes on, it may deter a burglar if they think they can be spotted easier. Also, if someone is creeping around the house, there is a better chance one of my neighbors might notice if the area is lit up. The light goes off when no motion is detected, and comes on for several minutes when it does sense motion.You can adjust the time duration and the motion detection range to whatever your preference is.This light has served well since I installed it. I&#8217;m looking at getting another for the other side of the house soon. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solar motion detection spotlight for outside.",1396051200,2014-03-29

2.0,"This product does exactly what it says it does.  I plugged it into the OBD-II port on my 2004 BMW M3 and it linked up to my iPhone 5.  Took three tries, but it worked.Problem 1 - (Unavoidable) - it requires you to leave a doggle plugged into your OBD-II port.  My port is just above my clutch pedal and there is a little door that swings down when the doggle is plugged in.  This causes my foot to bang into the open OBD-II port door when I use the clutch.  This is unacceptable to me.  I guess I could rip off the door.Problem 2 - The doggle emits a tone whenever a threshold is reached - either speed, acceleration, or breaking.  The tone cannot be turned off.  It comes from the doggle, not the iphone.Problem 3 - You cannot adjust the thresholds.  For example, it emits a tone when you exceed 70 mph. This is ridiculous.  Everyone drives over 70 mph.  Even my 94 year old grandmother.  Everyone.  The acceleration and breaking tones are similarly set with very low thresholds.  The inability to adjust the thresholds (coupled with the inability to turn off the incessant tones) will lead me to remove this from my car.Problem 4 - It strives to tell you how much each trip costs you, but does not give you the ability to input the price of gas.  This makes the readout completely unreliable.The whole point of this seems to be to prompt your to get better mileage.  (There is also a function to send a text message if you are in a major crash.  Presumably that means the airbags deploy.)  It is a giant nag and the inability to customize any of the thresholds makes it pretty useless to me.  It was constantly beeping at me.  After three days of driving with it, I have learned to simply ignore the tones.  That defeats the purpose.UPDATE: After leaving this attached to my car for two days of non-use I have a dead battery.  Never had a dead battery before in this car and often leave it for a week or more without use, so I am blaming this device.",1383004800,2013-10-29

They work well with liquid traditional waxes, as well as the new ""clear"" types like Turtle Wax Ice (the product for which I specifically purchased these).

I hope the seller can specify or check their spec before they list the the HID for sales. At last, I sent my problem to Amazon Customer Service. They issue a return label immediately for me to return Kits. Their service is real high efficiency and promptly to solve out my concern.

4.0,"I have to admit to a fair amount of skepticism when I thought about this product. It claims a water-free car wash and that you can get 4-6 washes from each bottle. Well, I live in the city, and that city is Minneapolis so the water hose is already put away (October) due to the cold. I did a couple of spot cleanings with the product, and they worked well, so I went ahead and did a full car cleaning. Yep, this stuff seems to work pretty well. It still takes some elbow grease (as my parents would put it) to clean off really stuck on stuff (pitch from trees and berry-filled bird droppings) but the Eco Touch stuff does work.It's not cheap though, and if I had a garden hose out, I'm not sure that I wouldn't use some cheap Turtle Wax car wash. But for the winter season in Minnesota this looks to be a good product. And if you're committed to using less water, then this is a car wash that works well without water.",1256428800,2009-10-25

Once I found out, I knew it was the cracked hose.  Cleared the message using this unit, and it never came back.  Had I taken it to a mechanic or dealer, they'd probably have told me it was some other problem and I wouldn't have know if they were telling me the truth or not.",1206748800,2008-03-29
4.0,"The pin can be moved to either of two positions, giving it a pretty wide range of motion.  Using this to remove some pretty tight ball joints that a pickle fork and some serious persuasion with a sledge hammer would not budge, this did get the job done.  However, there's a steel ball in a recess on the end of the bolt to allow the bolt to turn while you crank it down.  I put a pretty good flat spot on that ball the first time I used it.  It still works, but not quite as smoothly as when new.  There was an incredible amount of force being applied to flatten about 1/4 of a ~quarter inch steel ball, and the tool didn't break, so I guess this is alright.  Either way, this worked on my '95 BMW 740i lower control arms, where a pickle fork couldn't get a good bite and where there was no room to directly hammer on the ball joint, so I'm happy with it.  I've used it on all of my subsequent jobs, and it hasn't broken yet.Probably the main thing I'd like to see improved upon would be the use of a flanged bolt head so a wrench (like a Gear Wrench) could be easily used without slipping up the head onto the threaded area.  But a socket on a ratchet handle (preferably a large ratchet) can be used just fine.",1394409600,2014-03-10
5.0,I used this to seal paint on an old corvette painted 16 years ago that was still in good shape. I polished the finish first and used this as final step to seal/protect finish. I used an electric polishing wheel to apply this and removed after about 15 minutes or so as recommended with a microfiber cloth by hand. I think I have used just about every wax and polish ever made and am happy with the glossy shine this sealer leaves. also when removing this it doesnt leave any dust or powder residue like most waxes do. I cant attest to how long shine lasts yet since I just applied this product today.,1367712000,2013-05-05
5.0,Another top line product at a killer price. Less than $10 per 12 oz bottles is crazy let alone these are 20's. I couldn't pass it up. I've found that regular use of this product (every 15 tanks of gas or so) will improve mpg. The first time user with back to back treatments will see most improvement off the bat.,1394928000,2014-03-16

Overall, a great product worth checking out.  I haven't used in snow/ice winter conditions (which is why only 4 stars) and will edit review accordingly at a later date.

5.0,"This towel is the softest and thirstiest towel I've ever used.  I was able to completely dry an entire car with this towel alone.  And that is in the humid clime of Houston, TX.  I have other Griot's Garage towels that I think very highly of, but this towel sets a new bar.First, this towel is so thick that it seems more like a mat than a towel.  It has a plushness that feels squishy.Second, this microfiber towel is incredibly soft.  Your car's paint is not going to suffer damage by this towel.Finally, this towel can take in a tremendous amount of water.  One pass over a wet surface yields a complete dryness.  Not even a bubble of water remains.  I was really impressed and my first thought upon using was ""I'm buying my dad one of these for Father's Day"".In my experience, Griot's Garage generally makes quality products, but this one is at the top of my list.  The current price of $17 seems like a real bargain.  Highly recommended for ""car guys"".",1368921600,2013-05-19
4.0,"Very useful. They really absorb water and dirt, which makes them great for cleaning my car. My only objection (and the reason I gave them 4 stars rather than 5) is that they become extremely heavy.

5.0,"Thanks to all the other reviews, I've put one of these through it paces with Torque Pro.  It talks to my Droid 2 phone without a hitch tested over 10 hours _each_ driving a Toyota Corolla 2003 and MX-5 2011. Some data sent to Torque were available from my car dashboard such as rpm, speed, engine temperature, gas level, and trip odometer reading; they were identical to Torque so I presume all the other data provided was true: engine load, MPG, 02 sensor voltage and many more. I do not have an MPG computer on my cars, and this provides one, at the least.  I had to calibrate it but its now spot on, less than 1 MPG off when compared to manual calculation of filling a tank to full against miles driven from last full fill.  The engine load values and instantaneous MPG reading help me further 'tune' my driving style to maximize gas mileage.I don't know how long this dongle will last, but for $12 it does everything Torque asks of it, and Torque warns that many clones of the original product [ of which this is one] malfunction or transmit wrong values over time.Two minor annoyance are it has no off-on switch so the device is on all the time once installed, even with the key out of the car.  The LED face the wrong direction when mounted on my cars, its either flat against a wall or dashboard so you can't see it.Note, Torque free does not work as cleanly as Torque Pro.  Bluetooth pairing did not work reliably [ I had to manual find the device sometimes], if it did work it took a long time to complete and some dials didn't work as smoothly or quickly and may give the wrong impression of how well Torque Pro really works.  With Pro, I just pop the Vgate dongle into the OBDII and turn the app on, and it locks on quickly and reliably, on both my cars.",1385078400,2013-11-22

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the results, though if you are close to the vehicle you can still see some streaking where the product just didn't want to adhere as well as in some areas.  Obviously I can't be certain with independent labratory testing (LOL), I do think my results were more a function of the condition of my bumper at the onset.  It seemed as if some areas of my bumper accepted the polish almost like a sponge....while other areas almost appeared to have wax as the polish sort of smeared and wouldn't apply evenly.Even so, after a third coat I was pleased with the end results.  The bumpers and side trim look like new from any distance greater than 10 feet away.  As I stated, as I get closer you can clearly see some areas that look a little ""funny""....but it is still a huge improvement over what they looked like prior.I should note that I used this product on a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee - a vehicle I care very little about in regard to its appearance.  Still, I would recommend it to someone with an older vehicle that is trying to make their vehicle look a little better.

4.0,Excellent construction and as the saying goes you get what you pay for.  I struggled with manual grease guns bought at big box stores that just were not quality products.  Decided to take the plunge with a quality product.  Paying for quality is painful...until the first time you need it.  This gun really delivers and the hose is long enough you don't struggle to much.  The only thing I struggled with is that the nozzle has to be screwed on and off the zerk fitting which is great in that you don't have to push the nozzle on the fitting so grease does not ooze out.  The tough part is turning the nozzle so it locks onto the zerk when there is any grease on the nozzle body.  This product could be improved with more pronounced knurling on the nozzle for better grip.  This would add pennies to the cost of the unit if anything and earn it that fifth star.  I hope Lincoln reads this.,1375747200,2013-08-06

As long as i'm working anywhere on my property, I can pick up the wi-fi and use it in conjunction with the supplied software (mobile data can be used also). This is extremely helpful due to the fact that the program will help you find RELEVANT information regarding a solution to any trouble codes it may have found. And for the price, you really can't go wrong. A final note, this scan-tool includes only the adapter and software, and does not have any type of display.

As for use, it's straightforward.  Automatic braking is inertia activated. The manual over-ride is fully adjustable. I also don't tow a trailer that much - maybe a dozen times a year, so I really don't want all this stuff in the way.

Prior to switching to these wipers I had been using theRain-X Latitude 8-In-1 Premium Graphite Coated Wiper Blades.

The hardware and blades did not feel cheap, which made me hopeful that these would last a good while.Installation was easy; they snapped right in to place.  I just had to make sure that I placed the correct blade on the correct side, as Bosch gives two different parts depending on drivers or passengers side.Performance so far has been excellent.

2.0,used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area. I had 2 little spots approx. 1x2&#34; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top. let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat. It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products. I used &#34;Rost-Egal&#34; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far.

4.0,"SPLAT - the ""Cleaning Putty that removes debris from nooks and crannies"" -- does what it claims to do -- it DOES pick up (very nicely) that dust and dirt and debris that collects in those hard-to-reach corners, nooks and crannies of the car body.Using it takes a bit of adjustment -- it is super ""viscous"". You need to hold it firmly in your hand, and then press down just as firmly to make total contact. Lift it up - there's the dirt. Don't leave it on too long, or you will have to tug at it to get it off, and there might be some ""droplets"" left on the finish, MOST of which can be picked up by pressing SPLAT back onto the droplets. There was a ""Shadow"" left on my car's surface for a brief instant after lift-off, but upon inspection, it was not any kind of oil and it actually dissipated/evaporated in a few seconds.This would, IMHO, be great to use as a ""before"" wax prep, after you have washed the car and dried it off -- so all the dirt is actually GONE before you wax. I would think it would also be great to use at a rod run or local car show, to get off any bits of dust that may have migrated to that otherwise-spotless finish.Word of caution -- try not to drop it on the ground. Sadly, there was a newly mulched lawn right next to my car and while I was using this product, I dropped it... on the mulch. True to form, after I picked out what mulch pieces I could, SPLAT just prety much surrounded the rest of the mulch with its gooey body (after being placed back in its jar for a while) and kept on performing its job flawlessly.June 2012: UPDATE. SPLAT is Dead. Long Live SPLAT... Would I buy this again? well... I would consider it. It has now turned into a container of SPLAT soup.

Over the following few weeks, the hesitation slowly worsened and when replacing the fuel filter didn't clear up the problem, our mechanic neighbor suggested we try a quality fuel system cleaner. Knowing from experience that many fuel additives are completely worthless, I did a lot of research before deciding to give Red Line a shot. Having thoroughly read many of the other Amazon reviews, I decided to add three ounces of Red Line to five consecutive 15 gallon fill-ups. The result was that somewhere into the third tankful, the hesitation slowly began to fade, and by the time we finished the last of the additive in our fifth tank, the engine was running as good as new. I plan on keeping a bottle on hand and adding three ounces every few tankfuls to help maintain the health of the fuel system.",1362182400,2013-03-02

2.0,"I waited for actual snow before writing this review, it's snowed about 3 inches so I unpackaged this unit donned my gloves and hat and set forth to clear my car. There are two clips on the unit where the handle is stored, unclipped the handle and adjusted for size. ( I have a small SUV) First setback was the units handle locking and unlocking system is tight and secure, really really tight and secure! After some grunting and twisting I got the thing set up. When tight, unlike the photo the scraper is at a 90 degree angle to the snow pusher ( more on this later). The foam snow pusher actually did a good job and cleared snow cleanly with no marring, it seemed to hold up to the usual edges and bumps from wipers, antennas, etc. and the length made the job quick.After snow removal I used the scraper end to get the light coat of ice off the windows. Because the foam pusher end is at 90 degrees to the scraper you end up trying to manage scraping with a wet 18 inch or so pusher end oriented up and down dripping icy water on you while trying to scrape horizontally. Trying to unlock the handle for storage with wet cold gloves was an exercise in frustration I managed it by sitting in my car for some leverage. Now I'm no weakling but I can't imagine a slightly built person or a lessor grip actually adjusting this thing on a cold dark wet icy morning with cold wet fingers.

3.0,"I received this just in time to sand a newly installed ceiling in my dining room. The system is pretty simple... a sanding block, 8' of hose, and an attachment for connecting the hose to a shop vac. I wasn't happy at all with the way the attachment connects to my vacuum and like other reviewers, needed duct tape to make it work properly. Using this on a ceiling was probably the worst job I could have picked for it, since I had to contend with the weight of the sanding block, the entire length of hose, and about 2' of my shop vac hose. I later ended up using it for a smaller area on a wall, and it worked a lot better in this manner. The system does work decently for minimizing dust cleanup, but it's not quite the claimed 'most of the dust as it sands'. Biggest complaint would be the attachment that adapts the system to 'any' shop vac... as mentioned, it didn't hold very well for me and needed duct tape to secure it. It would be much more useful with an actual secure attachment.",1380067200,2013-09-25

The display will hold the setting until you press set again. Simple. I tested it against my expensive mechanical gauge, and they agreed to within a pound. Simple. It uses lithium button cells, rather than AAA cells, which means the batteries will last for a long time. It comes in a nice storage case that should protect it from getting banged around in the glove compartment.There's an interesting, though somewhat complicated, memory function that allows you to store two reference pressures, one for your front wheels and one for the rear. I played around with it for a bit, but it's really unnecessary as (1) my main car has the same tire pressure at all four wheels and (2) you can find the tire pressure on a sticker inside the door jamb on just about every car made. Too dark to see the sticker? The gauge has a built in flashlight, too.  With a price less than a lot of mechanical gauges, I think this gauge is a very good value.",1372636800,2013-07-01
5.0,"And I have used many, many different waxing and polishing products on cars. One I used religiously for years was NuFinish, and excellent polymer polish that can be applied and removed easily in the scorching, Florida summers I work in.Late last year (2009), I discovered a product called Meguires Cleaner Wax which is a carnuba-based polishing product, and I moved on from NuFinish (but always keep a bottle of NuFinish in your supply cabinet for those BLAZING hot days though). That said, Meguires cleaner-wax adds a deeper, wetter shine than NuFinish but does have it's limitations in removal in the hot sun, especially on darker color paint jobs. You have to ploish section-by-section with it.Then I came across Chemical Guys' Butter Wet Wax, and just let me say, when I detailed several of my customers' vehicles, they were extremely impressed with the finish, and I was impressed with the way it applied and was removed in the hot sun.Chemical Guys doesn't lie, their Butter Wet Wax looks absolutely amazing, especially when it's applied over an already existing polish and/or wax job. It leaves a deep, mirror finish that actually looks wet. The darker the color the wetter the look. I tested Butter Wet on mine and my mom's car (both are white), but they still looked very, very good, but when I was able to use some on a few of my customers' dark-colored cars, I just stood back and admired the result.Try it.Buy the 16 oz. bottle first and test-try the product out and see how you like it and I believe you'll be impressed enough to go ahead and buy the gallon supply and you will probably come back for more. One 16 oz. bottle should easily be enough for 20 - 30 or more cars depending on size. It spreads evenly and doesn't take a lot to get the job down. Always keep your applicator pads just slightly moist-damp though, not heavy-damp or dripping wet, as I've found only moist-damp offers the best application because of the oils already in the wax.Also remember though, this product works better over an already existing polish job. On your repeat customers (or just your own car), I've found the Meguires cleaner-wax or NuFinish offer a great base coat and then the Butter Wax sends the shine to an entirely different level. Then you can just use a detailing spray a few times to gloss it out again until you use Butter Wet again.It's really an impressive product, and btw, I just ordered the gallon supply.",1271635200,2010-04-19

5.0,"Installed on a Corolla and can easily say this is the best most noticeable and useable auto upgrade I've done on the car.  The difference in lighting is like night and day.  There's no voodoo science behind this either - these emit 800 lumens more per light than stock.  That's over 1600 lumens total.  How does that work in the real world?  Take a typical LED (not old bulb) flashlight and these emit just under 100 lumens.  So it's like having 16 LED flashlights pointed out on the road over what you originally had.  Best of all, the light from ahead differs little from stock lights so nobody gets blinded (unlike HID bulbs in regular headlights).Yes, these require modifications to install into the stock 9006 port.  The modifications require a toenail clipper, common sense, and that's it.  Just take the old light out and match up the tabs then trim down appropriately.  It takes about 45 seconds to do right per bulb.  That's right, 45 seconds.As I stated, the difference is immense.  No reason to not get these since they don't cost that much more than regular bulbs either.  No flashy packaging here with ridiculous marketing slogans you see on other nonsense bulbs sold out there so many do not know about these.  Buy these and educate others too.",1350000000,2012-10-12

4.0,"This is one of the few well documented, safe and reasonably effective products you can add to your gas tank that will not harm any part of your engine and perhaps help various issues depending on what your car needs.  It is safe because it has been used for years in Chevron gasoline.  The highest concentration of it are in the premium grade.  There have been lots of studies done on Techron.  The only difference between a bottle of this and the Techron in the pump at the gas station is that the Techron in this bottle is a much higher concentration. The reviewer who said that Chevorn stations were disappearing did not know what he was talking about and as to his manual stating not to use additives that may or may not be the case but for Techron since it is in pump gas it makes no sense this product would be included.  It is designed to clean deposits in fuel injectors and carbs and to some degree help clean or prevent buildup of deposits on valves.  It may nor may not increase MPG, that is entirely dependent upon the issue you are having and how much a detergent added to your gas can clean. If your fuel injectors can have a better spray pattern then perhaps you could see minor increases in MPG.  It is more likely to help an engine run and idle smoother and have power closer to what it was new if the fuel system has become inefficient due to becoming dirty with deposits. In many instances it can help clean deposits to an extent where there is a noticeable improvement in how your engine idles because it has helped to unclog your fuel injectors.  Again it certainly is one product that will not in any event harm your engine. It also will very likely help keep those deposits from becoming an issue in the first place if used on occasion.  However this, like any other gas additive can only do so much. It is reasonable to try using it before moving on to a more expensive repair, but no gas additive can take the place of a mechanical cleaning or replacement or a fuel injector or repair of a damaged engine.  So if you are going to use a cleaning fuel additive this is one of the best and the safest to try.  Just remember there is no ""engine rebuild in a can"" and the bulk of products such as oil additive mask serious wear issues at best.  If you have relatively minor issues that could be helped by cleaning of the fuel delivery system this is one of the first easiest steps to take, along with changing fuel filters and any other maintenance that your car may need such as replacing spark plugs.  If this does not work there are machines at shops that are made for cleaning fuel injectors and related systems such as MotoVac which runs a cleaning fluid in a closed loop for a long period of time.  That is a step up from adding something to your tank. If that fails than a mechanical remedy is needed.  The only other two products I would consider using are made by Redline and Lucas.  They make good products in general and have had good reviews on their fuel system cleaners.  So feel safe trying this but don't expect miracles.  Proper engine maintenance is going to be your best and lowest cost way to avoid repairs and keep your car running like new more than any other thing you can do.",1308268800,2011-06-17

4.0,"ANCO's Contour Wiper Blades offer good contact to your windshield, streak free wiping, and easy installation.  I've had the joy of purchasing contoured wiper blades for several different vehicles.  Truth to be told, they do not always work best on windshields that have a heavily curved shape.  I got these Anco blades to go on a minivan, which had a mostly level shape all the way across.Easy is simple, as it is with most wiper blades.  The UB series comes with connectors for vehicles that may not have to same style.  Within a few minutes, the blades were installed.  Under normal conditions the blades appeared to have good contact.  My first tests were just with windshield washer fluid, but then came the perfect test environment...an entire day of rainy weather.Contact was good across the entire blade.  As I noted earlier, if you have a windshield that is more curved you might have an issue on the ends or in the middle of the blade depending on the degree of the curve.  But overall, the contact appears to be very good and the pressure applied to the windshield was very good.  Wiping at slow or high speeds produced a good, clean wipe without streaks.

4.0,"The solar panel came neatly packed and included a decent instruction manual.  The connectors have rubber skins on them to prevent accidental short circuiting.

The charger is really just a battery maintainer because it puts out so little amps, but that is what I need it for.It has a nice compact size and is lightweight (9.2""x9.2"", 1.8lbs).  The suction cups are cool for mounting on the inside of a window.  One of my cars has power at the 12V outlet with the key off and the other doesn't.  No power equals no solar charge as well.  The manual says ""If your 12V plug connector does not operate while your vehicle is off, you can charge and maintain your vehicle through the OBDII connector.  You can purchase this accessory online at batterylife.com"".  I checked the website, but no mention of the OBDII connector.  I sent an email to the company and 2 weeks later, no response.The manual says ""For extra waterproofing and to extend the life of the panel, use a silicone bead around the edges of the inside frame.""

5.0,"The DB Power Autel OBD-2 code reader is a small solid basic code reader. The device can read codes, save a snapshot of the codes, and reset the codes - all pretty standard features of a code reader. The control package is rugged, the buttons and LCD have a membrane cover. This is for the backyard mechanic that will do occasional reads, it is not a commercial reader, one that an auto mechanic would use every day. All that said, this is still a solid device with heavy insulation on the wire and good strain relief. For the price, this is extremely well built.The cable is just over two feet long - exactly the right length to plug in the analyzer and sit in the driver's seat. The LCD is backlit with reasonably sized characters. The two buttons have a solid distinct sound when they are pressed.The instruction manual is excellent. There is a long preface about OBD, the abbreviations used, and the caveats for which era of cars will work with the analyzer (the simple answer, if your car is newer than 1988, you can probably read the codes.Using this device couldn't be easier - turn off the car, plug in the connector, turn on the ignition (without starting the car - the battery light will be lit up on the dashboard), press enter on the scanner. There is nothing more to do. When finished, turn off the ignition and unplug the scanner. There's no reason to overcomplicate using this.The OBD connector is easy to find in most newer cars - the Federal government requires the plug be within a short distance of the steering column. Unlike most things in a car, these connectors are in a similar location. You might want a flashlight to find the plug. Sometimes the sockets are covered by a flip down panel.This tool only reads stored codes. It does not do real time reading. It does not read additional data like some of the USB / wireless readers.I tried this on a variety of cars and managed to reset a code on one car. Bottom line - the thing flat out works. I fully expected it to work easily on a 2002 Buick Rendezvous and a 2012 Ford Focus (I was able to read the VIN on both of these cars). I expected the Mercedes to not work at all - I have read that there are odd things about Mercedes that doesn't fit standard. Well in fact it worked perfectly on a 1999 Mercedes E320. Vin number for Mercedes is not supported. There are numerous cautions in the manual about certain compatibility issues with Japanese and European cars - that is for very old cars. Current production cars will have no problems with this analyzer. If your car does not scan - more than likely you had the ignition on before plugging in the meter, or you have the engine running. I did not expect the analyzer to work on a Ford Focus Electric (this is a full battery electric, NOT a hybrid) - it in fact did not work, there is nothing to read on that car, it is zero emissions. The operative thing, with the electric, the tool went through every protocol and then showed an input error and stopped scanning. Exactly as I expected.Resetting codes was super easy. There is a menu setting to erase codes, after pressing enter, there is a Yes / No display. If you press Enter again, all codes are reset. If you press Scroll, the codes are not erased. I like the &#34;are you sure&#34; moment on the display. Yes / No is a weird thing to display - there is no button to press for No. After codes are reset, it will look like nothing happened. I rescanned, and the code remained. In order to see the actual reset or clear in of the code, you need to turn off the car and turn the ignition back on.The manual has a huge list of error codes. I was surprised to find the exact code from a Mercedes. I didn't expect to find that code in the book.This is a reasonably priced reader. For a backyard mechanic that knows which end of a wrench to use, this is a great tool. For the average person, this is probably a needless purchase - unless you understand cars pretty well it is difficult to do anything about those codes. For example - what would you do about a P0938 - Hydraulic Oil Temp Sensor CKT Range/Performance - code? Most of the codes are that cryptic to the average person. The only way the average person saves money with this is if they try to bypass set codes to pass an emission test (if your state requires OBD scan emission tests). If you are really going to repair a Check Engine light, a mechanic already has more sophisticated tools to read the computer, and that will be part of the cost of the repair (he isn't going to reduce the cost of the repair because you tell him the code is P0938, and he might want to check the hydraulic oil system).",1397347200,2014-04-13
3.0,"I put this wiper blade on a small sports car with a decently curved windshield (Audi TT).  So far, the wiper has been on the car 1 week & has gone through 80+ degree weather, rain, sleet & snow.

The only difference was that the other car is kept outside all of the time, so was exposed to freezing temperatures & more weather at night.On the Audi, the ANCO blade seems to grip the windshield and it clears well in rain & slushy snow (2 days of rain, 1 day of slushy snow).

Unfortunately, they would NOT stick to the backing plate that came with the DA over 3,000 rpm like they are supposed to for the cutting compound to be used.

Also, if you're using Meguiar's 205 and wet sand with 1,200 to 1,500 or greater paper, like they say to do, it will be MUCH easier to get the scratches out. I used some 3,000 and sanded in a straight line (not swirls) and I did get a nice smooth finish.

5.0,"I used this stuff for years in my motorcycle tires and never had a flat in a Slime equipped tire.  I did have two flats (one front, one rear) on a couple of secondary m/c's I had, that did not have Slime in the tires.  That was when I used to change my own tires on the garage floor.  But I have a recent story.  Nowadays . . .Being older and less inclined to wrestle with tire changes myself, I now use a dealer shop to mount my replacement tires. I recently took my Yamaha in for the first rear tire change at 8000 miles.  I had Slime in the tube and the mechanic complained that he couldn't get it to balance and had to install a new clean tube.  OK.  Then . . .2 months and 600 miles later I walked out of a restaurant and there sat my bike on a flat rear tire.  It was a small rusty nail.  And I had not installed Slime in this new tire due to the mechanic caution about balancing.  I got it fixed, but here's my situation nowadays. . .I still am not using Slime pre-installed inside of my tubes. BUT - in my underseat storage compartment, I keep a new 8oz bottle of Slime and a compact 12v air compressor.  I'm going to try from ever again being stranded helpless with a flat.A final comment about running Slime full time, pre-installed.  The manufacturer does not seem to recommend that on highway speed vehicles, and describes Slime as a temporary repair method only.  OK, so that's what I'm doing now, plus preserving my proper tire balance.  However, in my younger more worry-free years I ran tens of thousands of motorcycle miles with Slime pre-installed in my motorcycle tires, and never noticed a balance problem.  I never had a flat either.I'd keep one in the tool kit.",1372204800,2013-06-26

They worked alright, I just wanted something a little better than stock without being the one that gets every other driver irritated at night.  I found in one of the Juke forums that someone had recommended these, so thought I'd give them a shot.Install was quick and easy considering how obstructed the area behind both bulbs are, and they worked just fine.  Brighter enough to be noticed from behind the wheel, but not so bad that it interferes with other drivers.  Color is about the same, but I have a better field of view.For the price, it was an easy decision.",1335312000,2012-04-25
5.0,"A powerful inflator, with a great screw-on hose design, and a so-so gauge.What I like best is the screw-on hose.  No more trying to flip a clamp quickly enough to prevent losing air from the freshly-inflated tire (or deflating it further when you first attach the inflator)-- there's the briefest hiss of air when you screw the hose onto the valve.  This feature alone is to make me really like the BellAire 4000.Also, it fills the tires faster than my standby battery-poweredSlime COMP07 Inflator, and much faster than either of my old (since-retired) 12V inflators. I have not had any problems with it blowing out the 12V socket's fuse, although that is a risk with this kind of inflator.The unit is compact, not as loud as other inflators I've used. It comes with a nylon carry-bag (fitted to not add bulk) which will decrease the inevitable gunking-up of car accessories that live in the trunk, and has storage for both the hose and power cord (which also keeps them from being damaged as they ride around in your trunk).  The power cord seems long enough for most standard passenger vehicles. All of these are signs that the designers were actually thinking about how this inflator will be used and stored.The flashing hazard light is a nice touch also, in the unfortunate case of needing to do a roadside inflation. The onboard worklight has 3 small LEDs in a swivel head, which is handy, but would be more useful if brighter.The major flaw in the unit is, predictably, the pressure gauge, which is only vaguely accurate (analog) and has an outer dial to set the desired pressure.  The inflator is designed to stop when the pressure set on the gauge is reached, but since the gauge isn't accurate, I got results like setting the gauge to above 35, with 31 PSI in the tire, and having the unit refuse to fill until I set the dial to 40PSI.  This means you need a separate tire pressure gauge and may have to disconnect the hose a couple of times to check the actual pressure.  Effectively, the pressure setting becomes only a safety cut-off ""ceiling"".So what this inflator could really use is an onboard, accurate digital gauge.  Since I can buy a decent, accurate, handheld digital gauge for 10 bucks, it seems like integrating that function into an inflator should be easy.Other quibbles: The tight-fitting nylon bag is almost too small.  The cable storage compartment could be a little bigger. The carry-handle is a simple plastic ring that protrudes from the top of the inflator-- a proper padded handle (maybe a T-shaped one) could have fit in the same spot.  Without the handle, the unit is a bit awkward to carry one-handed (although it isn't heavy).The one big feature I would add to this unit would be an AC-power adapter, since when I use it in my enclosed garage, I have to open the garage door, start the car, back it out partway, and then use the unit.  An AC adapter would make it so I could just plug into the wall at home, but still be able to do emergency roadside work with the 12V adapterSo could this inflator be improved? Certainly, with a better handle, more accurate and digital gauge, a brighter LED, and support for AC power. But hands-down it's the best tire inflator I've used, so I still give it 5-stars.  Recommended.",1384992000,2013-11-21

Ditto for summertime bug removal.  It repels rain so well that it is a viable alternative to doing an expensive windshield wiper mechanism repair (for those of us that drive old cars).  I work as a highway patrolman (er . . patrolperson) for a living, and quickly learned that windshield wipers tend to lift off of the windshield when when having to drive at 80-90+.  No problem with Rain-X as this is where it works best -- aided by the wind to blow your windshield clear.  MANY TIMES I have driven to a call at high speed, in blinding downpour rain, with my wipers turned off and seeing perfectly (and enjoying my coffee), while other traffic is stopped on the shoulder or crowded in under bridge overpasses (I still can't figure out the purpose of that) due to no visibility.

5.0,"A few years ago I began to notice a loss of power and rough idling, and our mechanic found no problems... he basically just told us that Ethanol sucks... to be more exact, ethanol sucks energy out of your car by generating lots of vapor that condenses and turns into water inside your engine as the engine cools down. This can lead to all sort of bad things including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.He recommended a couple product -- SeaFoam and BG44K -- which quickly took care of the problem by helping remove the water and cleaning the valves and fuel injectors too. I buy BG44K when found at a good price, and SeaFoam when I can't; put a can into the Mustang's tank every three or four months, and drop one into my wife's SUV at least once per year.If you have something similar going on and you know it is not a mechanical issue, give this stuff a try.

3.0,"As others have noted, you need to buy the nuts and bolts to install this.  It also wants a nice flat area to install - about 1-1/2' x 8'.  My steps aren't flat - but have some built in ridges for water drainage.  My step also has a cross member for strength (or lifting), but certainly limited my choices of locations.  One screw location conflicts with the support itself  in the &#34;up&#34; position (near the retainer clip) - so you either need an exactly correct length bolt so the leg can swing back into the storage spot, or drill two holes (one to either side that will stay clear of the leg).  I had it, so I found a way to install it with some shims and it seems to be stable.  As others have mentioned, it might be better to overdrill the factory 3/16&#34; holes and use larger bolts.  The leg doesn't lock in the down position, so it seem that it may slowly swing out of position over time when in use.  I purchased just one and mounted it to one side of the stair - when my door is open you are sort of pushed to use just one side of the stairs anyhow.

5.0,"My fog lights have been dead for several years because of the same thing that has happened to the OEM fog lights on nearly every other GM truck of similar vintage, the lenses fell off at some point.  At the auto parts store I was quoted $100-$150, which seemed kind of steep until they told me that price was EACH!Being a cheap SOB I wasn't paying that for something I didn't NEED.  Then the other day while looking for license plate light bulbs I stumbled across these fog lights for $40 each.  Much better!  So I ordered them, but I worried that they would be poorly made etc.First off, that troublesome lens.  The new foglight lenses are marked as DOT approved and the new design incorproates a tab on either side that mechanically holds the lens in place along with the adhesive bond. Not an equal design, it's BETTER than OEM.  the molding of the housing looks identical in material, weight, and shape.  Perfect!  Just because I'm nuts like this I added a bit of &#34;shoe goo&#34; around the lens as a bit of extra insurance against lost lenses.The lights came securely packaged but it was all easy to open.  the lenses had a protective sheet on them that can be removed after installation to protect from scratches.

4.0,"I'm a newbie RV person (though I'm 74 years old) so I hit the keyboard and took the advice and comments I read when choosing a sewer hose.  This sounded like a good unit at a reasonable price.  I have used it only twice so far - having the caps has kept any left over water from getting in my storage container.  The elbow fit nicely and the unit worked well especially since it has rotating ends. I didn't need to extend it very much.  Will update this review after using it extended more. I followed the warning labels on both the pipe itself and on the box to tightened all the connections before using for the first time.  I agree with another reviewer that it would be nice if they came from the manufacturer already tightened. I was out for my first extended trip and ended up buying at Walmart (for almost exactly the same price - but I had to pay tax) because my holding tank was filling up.  I usually think ahead better and order from Amazon. UPDATE: April 2014: Used for two summers dumping about 20 times. My experience: 1) When pushing it together after extending it be sure to leave one cap off as it won't retract if sealed at both ends. 2) Be sure it is attached to all four pins on the RV before opening the valve. It has held up well with no leaks (when attached properly).  Since we only use regular dump sites I plan to buy the 5' extension, move the elbow from this 15' to it and move the connecter from the 5' unit to make the 5' my primary and the 15' the extension for any time I need the extra length.

5.0,"The biggest question about these lamps I can't answer yet - how long will they last? What I can say, the 9006 bulbs fit my Buick Rendezvous perfectly (darn you Buick for making those headlamps so difficult to get at). The bulbs are much brighter than standard 9006 bulbs. There is no real blue tint to the light; at least that I can see (the Rendezvous has a reflector cap over the end of bulb, so that might make a difference).As always, when one headlight burns out, the second one will probably burn out soon anyway. It is always a good idea to replace headlights in pairs.The packaging for these lamps has to be some of coolest looking but stupid I have ever seen. They should design these packages so that you can remove the bulb easily without ever touching the glass capsule. The package should also protect the bulb while you are installing the bulbs. This package does neither. When you pull off the cardboard wrap, there are two thick clear plastic covers that fall off. The lamps are then held in a plastic base. You have to bend the two bases apart to get at the bulbs. Once the halves are separated, you have to really pull hard and wiggle the lamp to remove it from the plastic package.

I used the clay kit by Meguiar's to remove all of the particles before I waxed my car.  The surface, after claying, was absolutely smooth and the wax went on easily.",1378684800,2013-09-09
5.0,"I won't rehash all the glowing reviews about this sets' superior construction and content. I will say that both its handles survived multiple whacks with a drive hammer and survived. It is billed as a ""4x4"" repair kit for off road tires, but will also work quite well on passenger car tires.So here's my experience with a few pointers to make things easier.First after you gather all the tools, lube, cement (more on this later), pre-thread the rope plug through the needle, making sure you have 2 even length plug 'legs' bent upwards towards the handle. Locate the puncture, pre-lube the reamer and have at it per the instructions. You really will have to twist and drive the reamer past the tread belts. Although you can repair a tire on the car, you need so much leverage to drive the reamer, (and the plug needle) through the tread and tread belts, it will be difficult. I would estimate 50-75lbs of arm pressure is needed to push through. The tougher the tire (i.e. LT type tires with a lot of tread), the more you will have to push. Here's tip # 1; take advantage of the removable handle on the reamer (hex key supplied with kit), and attach just the tool shaft to your electric drill--instant ream job! Just don't overdo it!Now that you've rounded and trimmed off the puncture all the way through the tread, cord, and belts, use the reamer as a 'plug' to stop any additional air from escaping. Things go better with air pressure in the tire since it supports the tread around the 'target area', so don't let the whoosh of escaping air rattle you.Next, remove the reamer. Air will escape, but if you have about 20-25 PSI of air pressure left in the tire, you will have plenty of time to grab your loaded plug needle and put it in the hole. My first repair was rear tire on a sports car. Very limited working space=very little leverage. I could not drive home the plug. Tip #2. The solution was to coat the plug and needle with rubber cement(purchase separately as it is not supplied)(disclaimer: I think this was mentioned in a previous review-thanks). The cement acted as a lubricant, and while still difficult, I finally was able to drive the plug home. In my case, the kit-supplied lube was ineffective. It probably would have been different if I removed the tire however.Note: This is an ""open eyelet"" kit. The plug 'needle' has a open slot to facilitate its removal from the tire whilst leaving the plug in place. DO NOT rotate the needle when driving the plug into the puncture. You risk spreading/breaking the eyelet off the needle shank within the tire, or jamming up the eyelet with the twisted plug.Feel free to drive the plug all the way into the tire until the sliding cone stops your motion. NO fear of going too far. Put pressure on the sliding cone, holding it against the tire, while pulling the needle out. The plug is now perfectly seated in the puncture. Just trim the leftover exposed nub with a blade, leaving about 1/8"" excess above the tread, so it can be further seated by the rolling tire.One final point, you really need to carry, or have access to, an air compressor or air pump to re-inflate your repaired tire. Otherwise driving on a severely under inflated tire is inviting a blow out.Like everything else, this kit has it's limitations. It probably won't work if you have impaled a railroad spike as you cannot 'double up' the plugs. Also, side wall repair is out-too much flexing. Same with angled punctures.  However, when done properly, the self vulcanizing plugs should last the remaining life of the tire. Happy plugging!",1396310400,2014-04-01

4.0,"I have had a long term interest in this type of product before they were even available. I love cars, technology and getting additional information from how I live, work and play. I have a Nest thermostat at home, I use Wemo devices to turn lights on/off from my phone and this is the next natural extension for me-- more information about my car and driving.I'll get the bad part out of the way first-- I had pairing issues at first. It may not have been more than 10 minutes of issues, but the app kept telling me to unplug & replug the device. Knowing how my phone works and the old &#34;have you rebooted yet?&#34; from the PC days, I rebooted my phone and everything continued on with no issues.Once sync'd and working, the device automatically detected my car and configured it for me. The app is absolutely beautiful, and intuitive. It easily shows you how your driving is going, when you park and aren't moving the app automatically shows you where the car is (no need to drill through a menu, just designed simply & in a smart way), and you can easily access settings, functions, etc. in a way that is easy to discover and understand. You don't need a manual to discover & use this product.I don't try to hyper-mile, but I did learn quickly that I'm already an efficient driver. My car does already show me current MPG and overall MPG, and I'm comparing this data to my car's data and it's very close. For someone who really does have no grasp on how efficient or aggressive they hit the gas & brake pedal, this can easily help those who don't know. It could also be great for teenagers who you want to remind when they're going over 70, but don't necessarily want to nanny-mom them with an expensive solution.I was most interested in the emergency function that could call if I had a bad crash. This is something that you have to pay $20 a month for, minimum, with something like OnStar. I'm surprised they haven't come out with a device like this yet. This is a curious feature because you'll never know how well it works until you have an emergency. Of course it won't work if you don't have cell signal, if your phone is damaged, or if the device is dislodged before the crash it detected, but I really liked the feeling of knowing there is at least potential for some automated process to take place if I should have a severe crash. a &#34;simulate emergency&#34; would be interesting to try so you can see what would happen without really calling 911 or your emergency contacts.I've discovered and enjoyed a lot with this device in only its first day. I did want to concur with the support comment on another reviewer's note that they couldn't connect with the car's Bluetooth hands-free with this device connected at the same time-- I had no issue doing that, and as well still maintaining a connection from my phone to my Jawbone UP24 all at the same time.I was also a little scared or put off by the review talking about personal data and VIN number and web-enablement. Every modern tool with a smart phone app stores its data in the cloud. Whether you call the cloud a cloud, a private cloud or a website, every other device I have does this, so in this case I did not feel concerned. My insurance company has my VIN and knows my driving history, the BMV has my VIN number, etc. I would like to know more specific information that is uploaded & stored about my driving history. Do they store constant GPS & location data/speed data, or only acceleration trends and start/stop location/park location? I plan to learn more on that point.I can really see the future potential for a product like this. One thing comes to mind is fuel and travel: If you're in a place with limited fuel stops/gas stations and it knows you are x miles from the next one and you only have 1/4 a tank, it could recommend that you fuel up soon, etc. It could recommend more fuel efficient routing of trips if I could sign in with Foursquare and it sees that I often go to the dry cleaner first, UPS store second and Walmart third. Maybe it makes more sense to go to the UPS store last because the total mileage of the trip would be shorter. The possibilities are endless and I'm excited!I had a simple device looking like this that could *only* read codes. This is a huge upgrade for not that much more in cost. I want to get one for everyone I know so we can compare stats!Feel free to ask any questions below in the comments and I will do my best to answer ASAP.",1399852800,2014-05-12

4.0,"It fits well on the Jeep JK and looks like it will protect the taillight from things bumping into it.  But like all of these guards produced by different manufacturers, they are attached to the plastic taillight itself.  It will survive the casual bump from putting things into the back but it will do nothing for serious collisions.But like everything from Rugged Ridge, I like it.Even though there are three pages of instructions including pictures the instructions are not very clear.  They provide new screws that are longer than the original but they state to use the two inch screws on the outside of the taillight.  Well, all of the screws are two inch, its just that the two with the larger head and bigger gage go on the outside.  They also state to place the guards on the correct side but there is nothing on the guard to state which is left and right.  The first time I put them on it was dark and the lighting was poor.  The next day it was obvious that I had them reversed; no problem.  Fixed the error in 5 minutes.  They should put some markings on the guards to indicate which is left and right.It has taken me longer to write this review than it did to install the guards.  It should take less than 10 minutes to install them.  It is best to just look at the guards and skip the confusing instructions, use the bigger screws on the outside and spacers go on all corners between the guard and the plastic lens.",1382659200,2013-10-25

It is most handy for people to get a good sense of how far you drive and how much time it takes for you to drive.

If you drive as part of your job or need to do travel expenses, this thing rocks. It will also do what it advertises, which is help you do better on gas mileage.

4.0,"We has a 10.5"" snowfall last week so I had a perfect opportunity to try this out on my CRV that sits outside.The good is it does do a much more efficient job than a brush and is much kinder to the paint. I like that the foam head unscrews and snaps onto the handle for compact storage in the car and there is a hole in the scraper so it can hang on a nail or hook. When using the scraper end it is best not to have the foam head attached.The bad/inconvienent is the foam head screws on and when using it the head can start to turn if you put counterclockwise pressure on it. The telescoping handle takes a bit of fiddling to get it into the lock position.Aside from those issues it is so much easier to clear snow off my car especially the high roof on my compact SUV I will continue to use it and would recommend with reservations.",1355356800,2012-12-13

4.0,"I needed this to remove the wiper arms on my 2003 VW Golf. The drivers side arm was particularly difficult to remove. It was so hard in fact, I had to modify this puller to get the arm off. This modification is the sole reason for dropping the rating to 4 stars.Overall the quality of this puller is 5 stars. As mentioned by others the cone that is shown in the picture as being metal is in fact plastic. To me this is absolutely no issue at all though and is likely a rolling design change, which explains why the picture still shows it being metal. The force on the cone is minimal so there really is nothing wrong with it being plastic.The puller arms themselves are made of very strong steel and held up very well when pulling my seemingly welded on wiper arm. All of the stressed parts are strong and well made so this puller is likely to be the only one you will ever need for both battery connections and wiper arms alike.There is one problem I had with this puller. Had my arm not been so stubborn to get off it likely wouldn't have been an issue. The problem is the handle for turning the screw. What ever they made it from it is very strong. I didn't bent it no matter how hard I cranked on it. Conversely though, I couldn't generate enough torque to get the arm to break free. Also, the hood of my car was in the way so I had a hard time getting at it at certain points in the rotation. The solution was pretty basic for me, but would be nearly impossible without a lathe and a welder, which most people of course do not have.I cut the tee handle from the puller and then I drilled a hole in the end of a bolt so I could put the bolt only the shaft of the tool. I then welded it to the tool shaft. This allowed me to use a wrench or socket to turn the puller shaft instead of the tee handle. Once I had a socket on there I was able to easily get the torque I needed to break the arm free. Had this puller been of low quality materials this additional torque would have destroyed it. It did not break though, it held up just fine. Which makes me wonder why Lisle doesn't have a hex on top instead of the tee handle. I'm guessing they are concerned that people would over torque it and as strong as this is, I'm sure it is not of unlimited strength.I do think that in 90% or more of all situations this puller would work perfectly just the way it is built. In my case, living where they salt the heck out of the roads, things can be pretty hard to get apart. As an example though the passenger side popped off with no issue at all.I'd recommend this to just about anyone.",1387497600,2013-12-20

I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car.

5.0,"I've had these on my car for a little over a year and a half. (I know, because Amazon just reminded me of my prior order as I checked out the product page to order another set.) Only now are they starting to show signs of aging. Before these, I had wipers from Rain-X (two different kinds) and while they cost about 75% as much, they lasted 30% of the time. You do the math.In case you're not familiar with them, Bosch is the company that actually makes the OEM wiper blades for many high end cars (like BMW, for one). In fact, you'd probably be surprised by how much inside your car is made by Bosch. So, you're not buying from a company that is just marketing cheap parts made in China and selling it with a lot of marketing. You're getting OEM quality with these, if not better. So, when considered in that light, as well, these blades really aren't that expensive.So, the blades really do last, but will you be happy with them while they do? I think so. They hold the shape of the windshield well, and never flap or vibrate, no matter how fast you're going. The bracket is solid, and worked well on the J-hook in my car. Many other ""universal"" mounts didn't work so well, notably the ones from the aforementioned Rain-X wipers.They don't streak or chatter, and even after having them on my car for over a year, they are only streaking a small amount.Given that your eyes are the most important safety device on your car, you owe it to yourself to not skimp on wiper blades. But I'm pleased to report that despite the upfront cost, these are actually MORE cost effective than many other premium wiper blades, given that they are the only expensive wiper blades I've ever used that actually lasted longer than the cheap ones.Tip: the A or the B after the model number (e.g. 22A) refers to the spring force of the blade (i.e. how hard it is to pull it straight). The B applies more force, and would be useful if you have a highly curved windshield. The fact that Bosch offers not just a variety of lengths down the inch, but also two different spring forces, is another indicator of the fact that these are not your average wiper blades. I found that having an A on the driver side and a B on the passenger side works best on my car. If in doubt, just try A all around, and then if you find that the blade is missing spots on the ends of the blade, return the A and get a B.Last tip: Amazon's database is helpful, but by no means complete. If you think this will fit your car, but Amazon says it won't, ignore Amazon. They say neither blade I have on my car will work, and yet I'm extremely happy with them, as you can tell.",1364256000,2013-03-26

5.0,"I like it as It is not much more then their flagship product stabil and can clean deposits and remove moisture from ones fuel system . Moisture should not be much of a problem anymore though because ethanol mixes with water . The bad news though is gas with ethanol does pickup water where in the old days it sat on the bottom of the tank with other contaminents . It is the contaminents that circulate in tanks nowadays this helps rid your fuel system of . If nothing else it makes me feel better to use it . I put it in all gasoline for all equipment and vehicles in my household especially that which is seasonal .Update April 30 , 2013 . I swear my truck is running much better . Almost like brand new after dumping 32 ozs in the 32 gallon tank and running it through . Now I am putting in one can . My friend  tried star brite star tron gasoline additive and swears by it . That is a little cheaper and you use 1/3 per gallon . I may try it but I can honestly say I am very pleased with this 70 year old additive that has consistently cleaned fuel systems , preserved gasoline and kept gas from separating from ethanol that picks up water . I am not one to spend money on frivolous items that do not produce . Sadly I do not drive enough miles to do a fair millage test but I would be interested if anyone has had a improvement . My friend on the star brite claims it adds about 1 to 2 mpg . I wonder if seafoam has any similar benefits ? In todays world that difference defers the cost a considerable amount .

5.0,"My car is a 13 year old sedan.  I used to wash and wax my cars regularly, but let this one go for probably 6-7 years.  The paint lost its shine, and I ended up using this product along with a Porter-Cable orbital polisher to bring the shine back to the car's finish.I hadn't restored an oxidized finish before, so I had a lot of concerns going in to this - whether this compound was abrasive enough or if I needed one of the heavy cut products, whether I'd need a milder polishing compound after using this to improve the finish, whether I could do it by hand or if I needed to purchase a polisher, etc.  I learned about using a clay bar, but decided that was a step too far for a 13 year old sedan like mine.Meguiar's Ultimate Compound was strong enough to remove the paint's oxidation and restore the shine when used with the orbital polisher.  I needed to go over some areas a few extra times to remove some discoloration, but I believe this product is very safe for the paint and I never had the feeling that good paint was being polished off.Also, after using this compound I went straight to a polish to protect the new finish.  There was no need for using a less-abrasive compound to improve the finish.Very happy with this polishing compound.  It is a one-step, novice-proof product that will cut moderate oxidation and bring back the shine.  Personally, I tried to apply this by hand, and found that I couldn't achieve what I wanted without the power of an orbital polisher.",1383696000,2013-11-06

It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure, nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $72.00, Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump (single function and came with broken pressure release valve) handily.Even though it will be extra expense, I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid.

I could see I would need many hours to complete both headlights. Plus, there would've been machine buffing at the end which I have to buy the right type of buff pads.

5.0,"This is the only clay bar kit I've used, so I can't compare it to others, but based on the results, all I can say is ""Holy Cow""!  I've been washing and waxing my cars for 20 years, usually using a 3-step system (cleaner, polish, wax), and I usually get pretty decent results.  But I've heard so much about claying, I had to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.On my 2006 Honda Pilot with 100K+ miles, I washed and clayed first and was amazed at how much smoother the paint was.  I then tested a panel with Meguairs' Ultimate Cleaning Compound, and it did make an improvement, so I ""cleaned"" the car, then polished (Ultimate Polish) and waxed (Ultimate Wax), using an orbital polisher.  It took a few hours, but the results are astounding.  The paint is literally (not figuratively) smooth as glass.  I don't think it even felt like this when it was brand new.  The mirror finish is incredible.So if you've never clayed your car before, don't hesitate.  Just be sure to use lots of the included Quick Detailer for lubricant.I found the Meguiar's kit to be very good.  I broke off about 1/3 of the clay bar and that got me through half the car, then I used another 1/3 for the rest (including the windows).  So assuming that was the proper amount, I should be able to do 3 cars with the 2 bars in this kit.

5.0,This is a must for any 120 plug in accessory for your rig. I installed it on my front bumper and wired it to an on board battery charger and battery blanket. Makes life so much easier instead of popping the hood every time. I absolutely love it. Makes it look professional.,1397347200,2014-04-13
4.0,"This fits a 2004 Ranger step side well but is a little narrow and almost allows you to remove the tailgate by sliding the lock to the side. I didn't like that there was so much slop so I made a spacer out of a 1in (inside diameter) washer 1/8 thick, I had to grind a flat on the outside of the washer for clearance but it did take care of the excess slop that some reviewers are getting.I also had some flat rubber left over from a previous project and cut it to fit the washer and glued it to both sides of it using silicone adhesive. You may have to use 2 or more washers if the gap is wide or better yet find some kind of metal stock and make one. I know it's a pain in the *ss but sometimes you have to improvise.As per some of the other reviewers here to offer protection from the elements, and to protect the paint, I cut an old bicycle tube twice as long as the lock and used it as a protective sleeve around the lock folding the excess length over the top after squirting some WD40 into the key hole.After reading all the reviews it seems that there was a change in the construction material used, the lock I received was all metal except for the plastic around the radius, I presume it is to help to keep it from scratching the hinge. Otherwise it does seem to be a secure deterrent, enough to make a thief move on.The diameter of my hinge is 1 & 3/4.",1381276800,2013-10-09
3.0,"The Lifetime Warranty gives you that peace of mine.  This is really a nice polisher. Has more power then the Meguiar's  Dual Action Polisher, but a little bit heavier.  I'm not a professional detailer so can't comment on the $400.00 dollar polisherYou don't have to use the Griot 6.5 inch pads, you can used other manufacturers pads as well.  I like to use the Lake Country pads 5.5 inch pads.  Just make sure you use the 5 inch backing plate otherwise the 6 inch backing plate will damage the 5.5 pads.  The reason I'm giving it 3 stars was because the speed control dial no longer works. Speed setting 1 and 6 are the only speed settings that work.  Switching out under 30 day replacement.

5.0,"I needed a set of jumper cables for my new car and these had good reviews and were at a good price.  They have been used a few times already and do what they are supposed to - no complaints there.What I will say is that 12 feet really isn't an ideal length.  Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.  Because of this, I would recommend something a little longer than 12'.Great brand - get 16' version though.",1313539200,2011-08-17

5.0,"It's been said before, of course, but I'll echo the sentiment that you should not expect these to actually protect your taillights from much of anything.  In my mind they're a purely aesthetic enhancement, one of the few that I am comfortable adding to my Jeep. To me, that says a lot because by and large, I'm a function over form kind of personality.I had considered getting theMopar Guards(in black, not chrome), but I don't like the way they look nearly as much as these Rugged Ridge guards, and they were significantly more expensive.These are nice, solid metal guards that install quickly and easily.  I am extremely happy with them.  I will be sure to add a photo to the product images.One final note regarding customer service (not reflected in my rating since it doesn't involve the product itself).  Two of the screws that I received were of the wrong type (I got too many of screw A and not enough of screw B), so I first attempted to contact the manufacturer for replacement screws.  I never got a single response from them after several attempts.  I was completely ignored.  I then went to the seller and sent them an email through the Amazon contact system and got a VERY quick response, along with a promise to rectify the situation.  Some time later, an additional set of screws made its way to my doorstep. Two lessons learned: 1) Rugged Ridge makes good products but will offer no support, and 2) this seller deserves my future business.",1307491200,2011-06-08

They can be used with the other products from Tri Lynx like the caps (Tri Lynx 00019 Lynx Cap Leveler) and the chalks (Tri Lynx 00018-2PK Lynx Stop'n Chock Leveler). You get a bag of 10 orange levelers that can be used with the above mentioned caps under stabilizer jacks, or under the tongue jack (if you have a lighter trailer).  Of course, you could also use them under the tires as levelers.  Bottom line: great product, but should consider getting the caps.",1281225600,2010-08-08
5.0,"Install is straightforward and simple. EVERYTHING you need is included, from wire to tie straps, clamps to fuse. All you need are basic tools. To be street legal you have to use the included module and mount in a certain zone. The module connects inline with your lights so these use the appropriate brightness. - full or reduced.If you want to use these differently - say as lights for your truck bed or even as portable lights - you can just hook these lights up directly to a 12V source. You'll want a switch inline, but it's really simple! Even a 23A battery will power one of these for a few hours - blindingly bright!So these are versatile and easy to use and install.

5.0,I added a bottle of this to my daughters '94 Camry 2.2 before she took off for Memphis Feb 2nd. We live in the central Illinois. First tank out she calculated 31.8 mpg. That was an increase of 3mpg from when she drove there last June. Was it this product? Too many variables involved to say this is the secret to the Holy MPG Grail. I used it my car on 2 tanks and put it in my wife's car and saw no significant increase in performance or mileage. Long highway distance is where it will most likely make the difference. I will for sure start adding it to all my motorcycles and lawn equipment when they all go down for the winter and see how it compares to the standard Sta-bil.,1328572800,2012-02-07
5.0,Big fan of Griot's products and the car wash is not exception. Works well with the other Griot's products. Doesn't strip wax and builds a nice bucket of suds to help pull dirt away from you paint while you wash. I buy it by the gallon. I have four vehicles to wash and Griot's is used on all of them. All of Griot's products have a great fragrance. Very pleasant to the nose and my wife will come outside and comment on the pleasant smell. Great product.,1353369600,2012-11-20

3.0,"I tried these wipers recently and can say that they do a good job. They get a solid 3 star rating.The wipers do in fact clean your windshield and do a good job and removing water, debris, etc that is on your windshield. The wipers do install pretty easy. What these wipers don't do is impress me. The price point is good, at $13 a piece you are looking at a cost of around $26 to get wipers for your car. Not bad.But I also have tried a number of Bosch blades and prefer theBosch 4841 Evolution All-Season Bracketless Wiper Blade, 22"" (Pack of 1)to these. Those don't totally impress me either, but I notice that they do a better job at removing more water and being streak free. For example, if you drive through a car wash and at the exit flip on your wipers to shake off the last bit of water both blades will in fact clean the water off. But I found the Anco left some small streaks and drops of water behind where the Bosch left a nearly dry surface.You really can't go wrong with these wipers, is it worth an extra dollar to go with Bosch? Probably not. In the rain a little tiny streak won't be evident, in sunny weather that excess water will evaporate quickly, it's really a tiny amount. If you need wipers get these and try them out, they do in fact work, I'm just not giving it more then 3 stars because I am not ""wowed"" by these.",1366848000,2013-04-25

If you enjoy working on your car and have time to kill then this may be worthwhile time spent but if you are like my husband and myself then it leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to the wasted time.The glass sealant works but you have to make sure that your windows are crystal clean or there will be a haze.  We have had a few storms, hot days and pigeon attacks.  The windows seem less dusty but the pigeon fecal matter now slides down rather than stay put.  The windshield wipers do effortlessly glide, which I personally love.  My only grip would be that this product seems to do exactly what our old RainX does!  Seriously, there isn't much difference except for the fecal running.  I am not sure what would motivate me to reach for this product over the RainX considering how annoying the application was.  Maybe better results are yielded if used in conjunction with other Griot's Garage products?Recommend if you are in the market for a great glass cleaner that allows your windshield wipers to work effortlessly.

Results were good but the kit should include one more sandpaper sheet.  The kit includes a protectant to apply to the newly cleaned headlights.  I used a 3m kit in the past (on a different car) which did not include a protectant and the headlights discolored again in about 6 months.  Time will tell if Meguiar's protectant keeps the headlights from oxidizing again.  Overall, this kit is fairly easy to use but I preferred using a drill with a cleaning solution (as the 3m kit had) to using sandpaper and sanding by hand.

3.0,"Since I had just noticed my wiper blades needed replacing, I was pleased to see this item on the Vine newsletter and promptly ordered. The compatibility check is very convenient and tells you instantly which size to order for your car. Delivery was prompt, but the cardboard box was huge. Twice the length of the blade. Then the real surprise - there was only one blade! When you order one - you get one blade, not one set.I looked at the blade carefully, trying to decide if I wanted to order another one since the price per blade is more than most. The rubber blade is certainly much thicker and seems more sturdy that any I've ever had before, so I ordered another one and waited for it to be delivered.It arrived promptly, too, and installation turned out to be very, very easy, since my car has the bayonet type fitting, which the blade arrives with. The frameless style is quite nice. BUT, if you have a different type of fitting, the back of the package instructs you to refer to the instructions and additional adapters inside the box. Well, neither of mine came with any instructions or adapters in the box. Lucky for me that my car uses the the adapter that comes installed in the blade and I have installed wipers before. Other reviewers seem to have had the same experience.The blades fit well and seem to work well. I would actually say they are of exceptional quality. But selling them individually at a premium price and neglecting to include instructions or adapters as advertised is an issue for me. Even though the blades are very nice, I'm not sure I would buy these again because of these issues. Hopefully the manufacturer will read these reviews and take action to make sure the instructions and adapters end up in the box.As a side note, because it isn't specified on the packaging, I Googled for the Autotex PINK website and found that 10% of every purchase, year round, is donated to the National Breast Cancer Foundation.

I sat my Jeep in the sun for a couple of hours, went out and the old logo just pulled right off after cutting behind them with some fishing line. Then you're left with some sticky residue which comes off very easily with liquid glue remover and elbow grease. I actually marked just above the tops of the old letters with black perm. marker before removing them. Then you just pull the backing paper off of the new logo and apply - moving the logo up 1/8 inch to just cover your marker marks. There is also a film attached to the front of the letters so they all go on at once, you don't have to apply each letter individually.

5.0,"Great budget-friendly item to add to the garage arsenal. Microfiber wrapped around medium foam. Works great for sealants and wax application. I used them with liquid wax, and I love that they don't absorb 50% of what you're trying to apply to a surface - like standard foam pads do. You want a bit on the applicator, but enough to prime it so it spreads easier.If you use liquid products with these, be sure to give them a good pre-soak in hot water and microfiber detergent to break down the wax/sealant. I also like to wash these separately from microfiber towels - especially the ones you dry or clean windows with. These will hold a lot of product which can and most likely will, spread to the rest of everything in the wash.I use a little bit more microfiber detergent in a small (hot water) load, let it wash half way through the cycle, then stop it so it can soak for 10-15 minutes, and then let it finish on it's own.

4.0,"Because of the limited area this item works in, it's best suited for small containers. I put this in the tackle box and it works great. When it's not fishing season, hooks and leaders sit for months at a time going unused and this little thing is the perfect thing to help prevent rust. It's not powerful enough to put in a gun safe or anything like that. Just suitable for smaller containers like small tool boxes or tackle boxes. However, the cost of buying these and keeping them in a tackle box year round to prevent rust on hooks and leaders may not be cost effective, since hooks and leaders are cheap. However, if you have fishing lures your looking to keep in good condition, then this would be the right item for you.",1253145600,2009-09-17

He did nothing other than clear the code and told the wife to tighten the gas cap on her next fill up. Within a few days the check engine light came back on again, so the money paid to the mechanic was for nothing. Surfing the web sites I found others had problems and spend much money on their mechanics who were incompetent in resolving OBD2 error messages.At this point I decided to fix it myself and purchased the Innova 3100. I know nothing about error codes but with the help from Innova technical support, the internet newsgroup, various repair websites, the Haynes repair manual and youtube, I was able to fix the problem. I was also able to pinpoint and fix the problem on my son's car as well when his check engine light came on. How cool is this?Wow, the 3100 is a very nice unit, money this time very well spend. Couldn't do without it now. I must also add the Innova tech was extremely helpful, welling to spend as much time as needed on the phone to resolve any questions I had and going through troubleshooting procedures with me as well.

5.0,"This specific 18 inch wiper blade went on our 2003 Toyota Matrix, passenger side.This wiper does not come with any adapters. It is specifically for cars with ""u"" type hook connections. Though you might be able to fudge on size a little (I used the 22 inchBosch 22A ICON Wiper Bladeon my driver's side which recommended a 21 inch blade with no problems) but you cannot fudge on connectors. Please make sure that this specific wiper blade is certified for your vehicle.The most difficulty I had was removing my old wipers because I had no instructions for that. Once removed, this Bosch blade installed, literally, in seconds. It does come with rather simple directions for installation, and has a snap down protector where the hook is inserted into the arm connection.Anyway, not much to say about a wiper blade if it works and this works fine. It arrived in time to be used on a normal sleet and snowy winter day in the Midwest of the United States. The moisture was wiped away quickly with no streaking. Durability questions are always an issue with any product, and I typically revisit my reviews if there are any abnormal issues there. I expect at least 1 year out of my blades, and usually I get 2 or 3 years.An easy 5 stars for a nice looking piece of equipment that installs easily and (so far) wipes away sleet and snow with no streaking.Note: Since I also acquired theBosch 22A ICON Wiper Bladefor the driver's side of my 2003 Toyota Matrix (21 inches is the exact size recommended for the driver's side of my car) the review for that is pretty much identical to this one.",1327708800,2012-01-28

Then occasionally perform some preventative maintenance like when you change the oil, put more grease on it.  When I first got it and took it apart, it was tight and rough in assembly, after applying the grease it's operation is smooth and consistent, and should keep moisture and rust away.

5.0,"Recently, just this past month, I purchased a new car (Chevrolet Impala). I'm loving everything about it, except for one small detail. The factory windshield wipers that come with it are worthless. Sure a little rain here and there and they work sufficiently, but put them up against our Minnesota winter storms and they are wimpy. You know your blades are worthless when you get dirt, mud, slush all over your windshield and you debate which will make seeing out worse, trying to peer through it or using your wiper blades with the windshield wiper fluid which will probably just smear everything so badly you can see a thing,As soon as I received the Bosch ICON Wiper Blades, I couldn't get them on the car fast enough. With just a few minutes of work, the old factory wiper blades were history and 2 new quality Bosch blades had taken their place. Right away I noticed the difference. Ice doesn't get jammed into these as easily, and snow and slush are no match for these blades. No more issues with slush being streaked across my windshield as the defroster melts everything. It tightly grips the glass and scrapes everything off the windshield in scoops. You can really tell how well your blades work when you put them up against ice and snow, and these are exceeding my expectations. Love them and I can finally see out my windshield in the snow!",1327881600,2012-01-30

4.0,"Ok- let me preface this review with I am NOT a car decorating person. I ordered these to make my friends and family laugh when they got into Old Red (you know, the Escape that has torn leather seats, 175k+ miles on it, and you're dang lucky she starts in the dead of the Northern winters). Anyway, we hooked them up according to instructions and voila! They light, they flash, they strobe, they change color and laughter from the people in the car ensures. We placed them under the front seats so the glow radiates from below and plugged them in using the cigarette lighter adapter. The adhesive seems to work well on the leather bottomed seats and the cords all plugged into one another. Make sure you have the plugs in the right way so there's a current flowing. i suspect this maybe what happened to other people who couldn't get them to work- you have to make sure the cords are in the correct slots, not just all thrown together. If you are looking for a fun little gag gift or car interest- these might work for you.

It comes with a lot of attachments, and some general attachments as well.  We found the floor attachment to basically just heat/dampen a microfiber cloth, not really that great.  However the wallpaper removal one has had good success, as well as a few of the more general tips/extensions.It does take a few minutes to heat up, and then needs to be emptied after use.  It should also be noted that distilled water is recommended to be used, although the manual says that other water can be used (in our case we have a reverse osmosis filter, so we used that).My biggest complaint is storage of all the accessories.  Some fit in the machine, which is great, but a lot don't, and combined with the hose, etc it means you kind of have a mess wherever it is sitting.It's a good cheap way to get steam power for cleaning, and if you have tile/stuck wallpaper/annoying stains, it might help you out.",1366070400,2013-04-16

5.0,"I bought these for a set of Work Meister S1 wheels and so far like them.  The lugs are impressively small and have a snug fitting key adapter.  I have used a number of lugs before and these are probably the smallest I have seen.  The diameter of the the outside of the lug (with the key on) is no bigger than the diameter of the 60 degree lug seat.  This means it should theoretically fit in even the tightest tolerance wheels.These are spline drive lugs, so a standard lug wrench won't get them off.  This likely provides a small degree of security by itself, though for expensive wheels I would recommend a good set of locks.  I picked up theGorilla Automotive 71631NBC Acorn Black Chrome Wheel Locks (12mm x 1.50"" Thread Size), Pack of 4.  The finish will likely hold up well over time.  This is due to the nature of the finish itself and the fact that the key fits very precisely and will not slip across the splines.  I find that one of the main reasons regular hex lugs get scratched is ill-fitting wrenches which slip and slide across the surface of the lug.  You will get none of that with these lugs.The key for the lugs has a section for a 3/4"" wrench and one for a 13/16"" wrench.  I would suggest using the 13/16"" since it is closer to the middle of the key, and is a larger diameter.  This will put less stress on the key itself, reducing wear over time.Overall a very well designed set of lugs for tuner wheels.",1328054400,2012-02-01

3.0,"The 48"" hi-Lift hangs over the soft top roof by 3.5"" (with the top clamp down or off). I may cut my 48"" jack down to 44"".  It has tons of leverage against the gate bolts if it snags a good sized limb. Having the extra weight on the gate isn't ideal, but at least it's over the hinges. The manual says only to put 50lbs on the back including the spares weight. The rubicon tire is 75lbs (guess they are not great at math) so really adding any weight isn't great.The base of my cast steel doesn't slide under a lip it was made to slide under. It still will work. I'm going to try to pry it up a 1/16"" to make it work better. Maybe it would fit with the cheaper black model base better.NEEDS BOLTS AND ANOTHER SPACEROn the 2012+ there is an extra three 1/2"" spacers included to clear the larger hard top window. It's on the last page of the instructions included. It hasn't been added to the online PDF instructions yet. Take a look at that last page before installing. They forgot to add 2 bolts and a spacer to properly take care of the issue. At very least it is missing one 8mm x 70mm metric hex cap bolt. It should say 8.8 or 10.9 on the end. 2 of those bolts is better with a 3/8"" x 1"" nylon spacer. I found the hardware at menards. Home Depot doesn't carry it.The finish is a wrinkle powdercoat. It looks alright, but will likely hold dirt.The instructions pictures are easier made out off the web. They are on the RR website.After installed it is pretty stout.If you have a 4dr just stick your 48"" jack under the rear seat. It's a better option. There are also some good roll bar mounts.INSTALL NOTES AND TIPSI had to remove my rubicon tire before installing. I tried with it on, but the top left bolt was an issue.TRIMTo remove the gate trim pull/push toward the handle side. Then pull back on that side. Then after that angled retainer pops out just give a good tug straight out to get the other side. Label the bottom and top on the inside trim. The top is slightly deeper. It will be very noticeable if they are swapped (1/8"" gap on the top. Bottom will look nice).  The instructions template was not printed to scale in the directions. I printed out another true to size template off the RR site. There was an 1/8"" difference. It turns out the supplied template was a better fit for me. Line it up with the bolts before drilling. I drilled the hole with a 3/4"" wood bit (1/2' will not work for sure).  That will give you some wiggle room. You can also use a hole saw. It will get covered by the plate so no reason to cut it too close. There are a couple places were duck taping the washers to the mounting plates can come in handy if using the factory trim.. It will show if you look directly down at it, but will not be noticeable. If you extend it off the edge maybe you could pull it out after the install.BOLTSThe bolt sizes are mostly 13mm and a couple 15mm at the end. You will want touch-up paint after removing the factory bolts. You can take both the bottom off at the same time with the gate closed. Same thing with the top, just don't take all the bolts out at once. Leave 2 in.  If your installing with the factory trim you'll need to tape the washers before installing the trim. With no tire carrier you will install the big mount also with the right side bolt.On step 2 It's really confusing they say if you have a RR tire carrier do this. Well here is what your going to end up doing with just the factory set-up. Your going to install all the washers and spacers on the bottom right. On the bottom left you will also add the main mount before bolting it on. 2012's that are using the white spacers can bolt both sides with the included bolts and skip adding the main mount part. A better method IMO is to use a longer 70mm bolt and also put a store bought 3/8"" spacer (between the main mount and the mounting plate) in on that step.2012+ hardtop owners will add a spacer to the top right bolt. If you use the supplied bolt you will be lucky to get 2 threads screwed in. It really needs a 70mm length bolt.Hope that helps someone. The install took way longer than I expected. Mostly hunting down the bolts. Overall I don't love it on the back. I like it there just a bit better than adding it to the hood because of the jacks weight.",1374105600,2013-07-18
5.0,"Those who go on long road trips in particular know all too well the difficulty of cleaning your windshield due to bugs and road grime.  Regular water in your reservoir never does the trick but is quite cheap and easy to refill so many use this by default.  Some go as far to buy chugs of windshield wiper fluid at discount stores and this works better but still not that great.  None of these solutions ever worked so what I would do in areas with a lot of bugs was bring along paper towels and windshield cleaner, pull over to the side of the road every so often, and manually clean.  Obviously this wasted a lot of time as I had to find a safe place to pull over, and wasted gas for needless deceleration/acceleration back to speed.Fear not, this product actually does what it needs to do - it clears off your windshield by using a unique formula that attacks bugs and grime so you don't need to apply a lot of wiper fluid to get the window clean.  Yes, I am a believer now.  No longer do I need to bring along my paper towels with cleaner to manually do the windshield.Some hints - use a gallon chug of bottled water to do the mixing.  I would ensure you use bottled water rather than tap because tap water has high mineral contents that can end up clogging your windshield fluid nozzles over time.",1405036800,2014-07-11

2.0,"I actually have the wash pads and they are not really effective because they hold so much water that they become heavy and cumbersome to use --especially on the side and lower parts of your vehicle.Also, they take forever to dry. One time I accidentally put them away in a container when I thought they were dry but the inside was still moist. The next day, they smelled like mold.You could toss these in the dryer but it would take forever to dry. When you leave them out to dry, they take a few days to completely dry before you can put them back in storage.As far as washing ability, I wasn't impressed. They don't lather up properly and I feel like every time I go over the paint, I am moving water around and not enough soap.My favorite car washing sponge is the Zymol sponge. You can get it for like 8 bucks on eBay. It is made from a higher quality sponge material, it is the perfect size, and it just makes car washing so much easier.  Microfiber is good for a lot of things but I think a good quality sponge is best for washing.  I actually like the sponge better than a sheepskin mitt (Griot's used to sell a superior sheepskin mitt which I have and still use.)I will admit that these micro fiber mitt's/pads look really cool and they feel great when they are dry but once you drop them in the water, they become so heavy that you can't efficiently use them. You might feel otherwise but I have a feeling if you use these, you will encounter the same problems I had.  IMO a good quality washing sponge/cloth should be lightweight when loaded with water and soap so that when you are washing your vehicle, you are able to produce lather.  This wash mitt/pad becomes so heavy when loaded with water that it is not able to effectively do that.I don't recommend this product to wash your car.",1308355200,2011-06-18

3.0,"Summary: Ingenious cleaning product for anywhere dust gets into nooks and crannies.  A decent add to your detailing tool kit, but with definite limitationsUpon opening the container I was greeted by a bright orange lump of goo.  I was expecting something more like silly putty, this is exactly like a thicker version of ""slime"" with an orange color and slight citrus / chemical smell.I immediately started to clean the center console of my car.  There's dust, crumbs, spilled coffee, etc here and all sorts of nooks and crannies.  I was immediately disappointed by what it didn't pick up and it did nothing to the drops of dried coffee.  I was thinking that I'd much rather have a damp microfiber washcloth.After a few more days and lots of experimentation on lots of other things I have a higher opinion.  After watching the video I realized they were pressing the goo and holding it for a few seconds.  This really helps SPLAT pick up more stuff, though it's still so-so on larger crumbs and debris (I'm talking about stuff the size of a fingernail clipping.)There are definitely situations that SPLAT works is better - they all involve dust instead of crumbs, and very intricate detail.  For example, on my office seat there are narrow creases in the fabric that trap dust.  This stuff is a champ for pulling it out.  I immediately used it on my nylon briefcase and TV remotes and cordless phones.  It also did a nice job removing the dust on my keyboard.On the other hand it's not so good on cleaning screens and chrome.  It leaves a filmy residue that you have to wipe off.  Also, the consistency has changed just in a couple of days - there's condensation on the lid of the container which suggests that what I am seeing is drying out during use.  I added a few drops of water to the container and it re-hydrated so the consistency is back to original.  At the same time, I noticed that the slime re-hydrated some bread crumbs from the console.  Yuck.  I picked them out - I hope this has some antibacterial properties or I could see this getting moldy before too long.  Finally, seven bucks for 3 ounces seems pricey. I'd give it 4 stars if it was a couple of bucks cheaper.TIP - knead the putty as you use it, otherwise the dust anc crumbs you just picked up will probably end up somewhere else in the interior.There are recipes on the web for making slime.  It's just borax, water, and white glue.  Cut the water and add a few drops of citrus cleaner and you might have a reasonable substitute!>>PlusGreat for dust in hard to reach crevices.Great for getting dust, etc out of fabrics.>>MinusDoes not pick up crumbsLeaves filmy residue -Seems quite pricey for the amount they provideIf you have questions, comments, or if you found this review helpful, please let me know!",1285113600,2010-09-22

4.0,"I've been using beam blades for some time now, but just for kicks I bought a really cheap traditional blade to see if the performance was really any different.  Initially, all blades seem great - they wipe well and all perform about the same.  Beams are definitely nice in the winter time and that was reinforced by my recent test with the traditional style.  On highways, the beam stick to the windshield better and chatter less.I've tried many different types of beams from Bosch, Valeo and others.  The ACDelco's rate right up there with them, and honestly even among the ""premium"" vs. standard beam blades, I have never seen much difference in performance even when the price is substantially different.This blade in particular is very easy to install on my 98 Camry.  Over time it's just like others where it'll leave small streaks, but generally won't miss a large swath.  Also like all beam blades I've tried, their aerodynamics cause a bit of a low pressure zone right behind the blade, causing some water to follow the blade from the edge of the windshield back into your view.  This is the most annoying aspect of them to me, and these blades have that effect just like all the others I've tried.In summary, I think this blade performs as well as any other brand of beam blade, so in the future, price would be the deciding factor for me.",1365292800,2013-04-07

4.0,"Carnauba Wax comes from the fronds of a variety of Palm tree that only grows in Brazil. The wax is very durable and one reference said it is harder than concrete. It protects the palm leaves from the constant intense rays of the sun in the tropics. So it is ideal for protecting your car's paint. There are other products that last longer, but nothing matches the rich and deep warm  gloss that can be achieved using Carnuba wax. It should be applied, ideally, to paint that is not only washed, but depending on the condition of the paint, polished and or clayed to assure it will cover paint that is not  opaque due to oxidation. Only then can it achieve it's complete potential. Apply it with a sponge applicator in a circular motion using it sparingly to one section at a time, allow it to dry to a light haze and remove it with a quality microfiber cloth. Then buff it by hand or orbital buffer. Carnauba wax varies in price by manufacturer and can be very expensive. Previously, my favorite product for the most bang for the buck is called P21s Concours Carnuba Wax. The results if used patiently are spectacular and it costs about five dollars an ounce. My ultimate choice is Pinnacle Sovereign Paste Carnuba, but it is a staggering twelve dollars an ounce or almost $100 for an 8 oz. tin.  This Griot's product costs about $3 an ounce which makes it a screaming bargain by comparison. I found it easy to apply and the gloss is very good. My only question is how long the application lasts. No wax lasts forever and if the results last 5 or 6 months as the two products I mentioned will, that is outstanding. I read some comments of people who said this product did not have that longevity, though I will need to update this later to see what results I observe. Considering how much work and how time consuming it is to detail your car, I think paying double or more for a product that lasts longer is actually cost effective. My results so far are encouraging with this product; easy to use, good shine achieved, very reasonable price comparatively. If it has longevity, this will prove to be a real bargain.",1370044800,2013-06-01

Use the polish for a top coat and then wax and it will look great.,1324598400,2011-12-23

5.0,"As other's have stated before me... these are not PINK but rather ""PINK"" branded; AutoTex PINK in conjunction with the National Breast Cancer Foundation.  I will very quickly gloss over the fact that the packaging informs us that the company is indeed women owned and cleverly promotes ""Wipe Out Breast Cancer - Change your blades... change a life!""  Considering all the advertising these days with no positive effect whatsoever; these were a welcome change.Directly from their website/packaging:Wipe Out Breast CancerEvery three minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Because of these startling statistics, AutoTex PINK is doing its part by giving 10 percent of its proceeds to support the National Breast Cancer Foundation.Many have stated they were weren't really positive what sort of proceeds were being donated; for anyone still wondering it is 10%.Now onto the actual product!  I offered to help my husband change the wiper blades for the new ""PINK"" ones so that I could see the difficulty level.  The directions were printed on a tiny sheet and showed all the parts that were in the packaging.  We were set off track for about 3.5 minutes (lol) because we were trying to figure out what to do with the extra little parts.  My husband then realized that they were ""ready"" out of the box to be installed, where he proceeded to just snap them into place.  VOILA! done.  I was still reading the directions holding the little black pieces... beginners learning curve (and I am sticking to that).  Hubby decided that he loves the way these rubber wipers hug the windshield and cleanly wipe the window.  There is no sound and they stay nicely in place at windy/high speeds thanks to the frameless design .  We were not able to test the no snow/ice build up claims, but we will update later in the Winter.  If they do not hold true to the snow/ice claims we will still be ""repeat"" buyers of this frameless design just because of the difference in performance.The bad:  If cleanly wipes without leaving any streaking, but he has found that when water accumulates on the top of the driver's side wiper it can at times splash it over to the passenger's side.  Not a biggie at all though.Highly recommend for all to try the High Performance Frameless design; even better knowing that 10 percent will go to a wonderful cause to help so many women that have suffered/will suffer through this disease.FYI: You need to order two for your vehicle (one in each box)!  Amazon makes it easy to figure out which wipers and sizes go for every vehicle type right on the order page.  For our '07 Nissan Armada it was a 24 & 22 inch.",1284422400,2010-09-14
5.0,"I was mainly interested in using the Premium Leather Cleaner & Conditioner for my Merrells.  I wear them a lot and figured they needed a bit of a pick-me-up and had been using Scotchgard Shoe Guard.  Now the Scotchgard works nicely as a pick-me-up, but doesn't really condition the shoes. They were starting to show their age a tad, but needed a little something extra to really bring them back to life, not just polish them up.I also applied them to an old, worn pair of leather shoes as shown in the video.  The Premium Leather Cleaner & Conditioner really brought them back to life, paint specks and all.  It is a creamy whitish formula that I simply used a soft cloth to apply.  When I did this, with both my Merrells and the old pair of shoes, a considerable amount of dirt was removed at the same time.  I did not have to clean the shoes prior to polishing because this formula managed to do it for me.FEATURES:&#9658;  Easy to Use&#9658;  Can also be used on Vinyls&#9658;  Can be buffed to a soft luster&#9658;  Retards water spotting&#9658;  Contains no solvents or harsh chemicals&#9658;  Proudly made in the USAThe Merrills really looked like new, save for the creases I've generated from walking.  Stepping back from the old pair of shoes and looking at them, it's hard to tell that they are as old as they are.  The fact that they are resists soiling and retards waterspotting is a real plus.  The type of leather these shoes have is not likely to absorb water readily, but I do appreciate that added protection.  I would not use this on suede, nubuck, or textured leather because it simply absorbs the polish and darkens the leather considerably, something you may not like.Sample provided for review.",1388793600,2014-01-04

5.0,"Very nice LED work light.  My 2012 Jeep JK has no decent rear light to allow you to store your cargo when it is dark. I had purchased this light to mount on a spare tire light mount but the plate on the mount is too small for this light. I am needing to decide now whether to mount it in a different spot (not many other places to do so since I have a soft top) or find a larger plate to mount on top of the light mount.This is a separate issue not related to the quality of the light. It is a hefty light made of a combination of plastic and metal. The mounting arms are metal with rubber pads which may be a good thing and will help to dampen some of the vibration and keep it from being transferred to the light. The part of the mounting arm that contacts the light body is grooved as is the light body. This ensures that the direction that you point it in will stay fixed.The only disappointment that I have with the light is that the power cable that runs from it is only 12-14 inches long. So you either need to connect it to a terminal block, a switch or use some butt splices. I would recommend against butt splices because that creates a weak spot in the link. And depending on where you mount it there may be no place to locate a terminal block. I will probably mount a switch, because even though I will have a switch in the cab to turn it on it will probably be nice to have one by the light itself. I guess another option might be to take the unit apart depending on how you feel about invalidating your warranty.",1405036800,2014-07-11

3.0,"This is my 3rd brand of bracketless wipers.  I've also tried Valeo and Autotex.  As with all of them, this one installed easily and performs much better than an old, work-out wiper.We've had some rain, snow and frost in the mornings.  This wiper has been doing very well with all of these conditions.  This one also seems to have the tightest quality build of the three.  Overall, little to no streaking, no extra noise or skipping and does well on sub-freezing mornings as well.With bracketless blades, they have an airfoil styling to help keep them against the windshield when driving.  Sometimes, this causes  what seems like a low-pressure zone directly behind the blade which draws water back onto the windshield on the downstroke.  This one seems to do that less than the other brands.Overall, compared to the other brands I'd probably pay a little bit more for these ones based on experience so far, though I haven't had it long enough to compare it long-term.Update 5/2012:  This wiper isn't all that great - it always seems to leave small drops behind it on the windshield and seems to age rapidly.

It's a classic that suds/foams well and does a great job of getting off grime and washing off clean w/out residue.The interior detailer is a great detailer that does not leave a real greasy/ugly after effect on your dash/equipment that some others do.I used the PlastX on some old headlights and it seemed to work surprisingly well, I haven't been able to get them clean with any regular cleaner before, but i haven't tried any other specialty/target cleaners on them yet either so I can't necessarily compare.Quik detailer is good for cleaning off that bird droppings the day after you wash your car and you don't want to do it again. Now if they only came out with a product to get rid of the birds...I like the Gold Liquid Wax - I've only used it once though and i thought it looked pretty good afterwards and held up fairly well. I don't wax enough (I know I should) to really compare this well.If you just want to get a feel for some of their products, just starting out, or need all of them - then go ahead and get this kit.

3.0,"I love the Griot's Garage carnauba car wax so I was very interested to give their glass sealant a try on my car's windshield.  I have used Rain-X in the past but can't say I was all that impressed.The sealant is applied easily using a dry cloth (I used a microfiber one) after first cleaning the windshield.  Even though I thought I got the windshield very clean, the sealant removed some dirt I missed.  Griot's recommends applying a coat, letting it dry to a haze, and then apply a second coat and let it dry to a haze before polishing it off.  I applied the sealant liberally and still had a lot left after using it on only my windshield.  It dries to a light haze very quickly and polishes to a very clear shine with minimal effort.Rain beads up and runs off the windshield after using the sealant.  It's almost a Star Wars effect to watch the rain beads fly upward off the windshield while driving down the road.  In light rain I don't even have to turn on my windshield wipers.  It remains to be seen how long this effect will last -- my main dissatisfaction with Rain-X is it didn't seem to work for very long -- but so far I really like how this Griot's Garage glass sealant works, and it makes my car's windshield shine as bright as the rest of my car.  My car has expensive water-sensing windshield wipers, and I believe this sealant will help them last longer.  I used it only on my car's windshield, but the product is designed for use on any window including shower stall windows.'Update 5/6/14:  After using the glass sealant a while longer I must say I am disappointed.  It seemed to repel water really well initially, but this effect wore off after just a few rainy days.  It still works a little, but not enough to want to reapply it every week during the rain season.

4.0,Mr. Pink provides good suds for your car wash.  Works great with either a foam lance or foam gun.  Great product and smells good.,1400112000,2014-05-15
4.0,"The kit itself is easy enough to use, the instructions are clear but I've only had luck repairing tiny star cracks. Repair of small star cracks makes them nearly invisible but anything longer than 1/2 inch doesn't get filled well. Repair of longer (more than 1/2 inch) may stop the crack from spreading but does nothing to conseal it so the crack is still very visibe.Bottom line - don't procrastinate and use this product before the crack spreads. If you do that, this product should work well.",1404864000,2014-07-09
