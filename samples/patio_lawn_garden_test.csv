5.0,"What a comfortable chair! Just the kind of thing you want to recline in on a sunny day.It could be a tad easier to set up, but that's a minor quibble once you figure it out (it's not hard, esp. since people here who have already gone through it give instructions.)If you have back issues, you will LOVE this chair! Almost makes you feel weightless, takes pressure off the sore spots.Extremely comfortable, and a good price - we liked it so much, we're getting a second chair for a matched set.",1239840000,2009-04-16
5.0,This is the best product ever for planting in pots! You don't have to go gather up rocks to put in the bottom of the pot.  You don't have to put a coffee filter over the hole before you put in the dirt. You just cut the porous little light weight circle to fit your pot and voila! You now have the perfect liner for your pot.  You can stack them to make a thicker filler if you want. It cuts down on the weight of your pot tremendously.  I will definitely plant more flowers this year since it will be so much easier to do.,1308873600,2011-06-24
3.0,"This does work.  It enables you to give your plants access to water when you are not around to water them.  But it's not exactly a needed product, even for dedicated plant lovers, since it none too hard to set up your own wicking system.  That would do the same job, and do it for a lot less money.So: it works.  No problem.  But...needed?  I don't know.",1342742400,2012-07-20
5.0,"Never expected it to work so well for the price.  I purchased a light thinner hose because those that &#34;grow&#34; when you turn on the water have horrible feedbacks.  Mine is white with a blue line, so I purchased this blue nozzle and it works great.  Water all my plants every day with it and it never gives me any trouble.",1400198400,2014-05-16
2.0,"The idea behind this mouse trap is impressive--make three entryways for the mice so that even if they scurry past one side of it, they'll be suckered in by the smell wafting through the door on the other side. Well ... that didn't happen, despite having this set up in my garage for the past few weeks. I know there are mice in there because I can hear them. They must be laughing together over a few beers at the Hole in the Wall Bar at how ridiculous this baiter is.The trap itself is pretty much a no-brainer. You paste your peanut butter onto the plate, make sure all the doors are shut tight, and put it near a spot mice frequent (like right outside that Hole in the Wall Bar). If you think the bait has gotten a bit old, you can just wash it out under the faucet and paste some new stuff on.One plus on this trap is that the springs are all inside the trap, so it seems safe enough to leave around pets. Another plus is that there are no chemicals involved, and it definitely looks like it will kill quickly. Our mice seem to be smarter than the average critters, so perhaps we should just swap out the peanut butter for a smear of Guinness froth and catch some leprechauns instead.There is a 30 day warranty with this thing, and you're supposed to see the most mice caught on day 1, so even if this trap disappoints you as much as it did me, you can still get your money back.",1368662400,2013-05-16
4.0,"I found this to be helpful when I was starting up my pool after the winter, the package recommends using a double dose at start-up and I felt that really helped reduce the scum that I normally see after the initial shocking.I would recommend passing on the 1 quart container though, because you get 4 times as much in the the gallon container for less than twice the price, as pool owner on a budget I have found buying chemicals in bulk saves money in the long run, as long as you can store them in a cool dry place.",1403308800,2014-06-21
3.0,"So far, I've had mixed results with this pack. All the plants were extremely easy to plant, and having everything in one little pack that I can just stick in the ground was awesome. I have an existing garden that's doing very well, and used these seeds to round out my variety of plants. But, as I said, I'm having mixed results.By far the most successful of all the plants is the cucumber, followed by both the globe and cherry tomato plants. The cilantro is doing fantastic, and the rest of the herbs are also doing reasonably well. Everything else in the pack seems to not have taken, or is taking very long to grow, despite the fact that they're all in the same garden as the plants that are doing well, with the same soil and the same amount of water. I'm still hoping that the other plants will show themselves in time. I may update this review if anything much changes.",1371427200,2013-06-17
3.0,"I really like that this can be mounted flatly against a wall, fence post, tree etc... It holds a fair amount of seed and I find it's appearance nice and basic. Unfortunately, the design has a couple of major flaws. First the lid flips up very easily so it's no problem for squirrels to eat the whole feeder empty in the blink of an eye; also my lid doesn't actually shut all of the way either, so there's minimal protection from the elements. I think if you can mount it somewhere where the squirrels can't get to it and it's protected from the weather, it'll work fine.",1395705600,2014-03-25
5.0,"These Jiffy pots are exactly what they claim to be. They are small so be mindful of size when ordering, but they are great.Transplant shock? HAHAHAHA I don't think so!",1370908800,2013-06-11
5.0,"We found the readings from these test strips to coincide with the results we were getting from ourHM Digital TDS-EZ Water Quality TDS Tester, 0-9990 ppm Measurement Range , 1 ppm Resolution, +/- 3% Readout Accuracy.While the readings were very accurate, there will almost always be some estimating involved:  You do have to read between the lines, as in, read between the colors, to determine your hardness. Is it closer to this color or that color?  And, how much closer?  But it gets you in the ballpark and usually that is good enough for household use.It is a toss-up as to which product to buy:  While these test strips are cheaper than the digital TDS tester mentioned above, you can only do fifty tests.  The digital tester costs more (not that much more) but the amount of tests you can do is limitless.  We bought both at the same time because we weren't sure which product to trust.  Now we can attest to the fact that BOTH products are accurate and trust-worthy.",1381017600,2013-10-06

5.0,"Our lot is roughly 10,000 square feet, and this hose is just the right length - long enough to reach almost all our gardens/plants, but short enough that it's light and easy to carry around.It seems well made, doesn't kink too easily, and seems to have quality connections/o-rings (no leaks).Also a good price. Highly recommended.",1403740800,2014-06-26
4.0,"I'm not sure what is the ingredient is in this mouse attractant but it claims that while it's irresistible to mice, it's non-toxic to children and pets which is important to me. I think peanut butter works great for mouse traps but you really don't want to sit out peanut butter in certain areas of your home like on carpet, etc. Then again, in those areas, I'm not sure I would want to set a mouse trap either. Peanut butter is effective and cheap but I can instances where I would prefer to use the Tomcat mouse attractant.It also states that it is a water-soluble gel won't stain carpets or clothing.  It's easy to use the squeeze bottle.",1403740800,2014-06-26
5.0,"I planted a vegetable garden for the first time this year and even though we are in the middle of a drought, the snails still came. I think their shells are cute and all, but I really hate what they were doing to my garden. I've been using soapy water to keep other bugs off of my veggies, but snails seem to laugh in the face of Dawn detergent. Since this is my first garden, I had no idea that slug killer even existed!Fortunately, the Amazon Vine program is eerily good at offering me items I can use, and I happily snatched up Dr. T's Slug and Snail killer! The fact that it is safe for use around animals and children is a huge bonus for me, although I might have been willing to make a sacrifice in order to get rid of these slimy critters. Lucky for me, Dr. T saves me from those kinds of decisions. I just applied it to damp ground all around my plant bed, and within a couple of days I was finding little snail corpses around the edges of my garden.It's so nice to find a product that does what you need it to (like the murder of simple creatures) without harming anything else!",1308614400,2011-06-21
5.0,"i picked this up because we have had an epidemic of rabbits lately. They seem to just appear in droves, eating anything they find including gardens. so, I took this and sprayed it, trying to see if it helped. It did. Where I had armies of irritating rabbits wandering around there seemed to be a barrier, and they didn't want anything to do with it. I liked that and I liked the ease of use, which came from having a spray bottle. honestly, i never pictured myself wanting more of this but I found another little bonus and it is almost as good as the rabbits being buffered from my stuff.When I park my vehicle, we have a lot of open areas and fields filled with grass. This means you get a lot of field mice and they like to climb into vehicles and nest. This year alone, I have had six do that in my Jeep and that is not only annoying but awful. anyhow, I sprayed this around, avoiding the areas when my cats are, thinking it might help. I also knew there was a mouse attempting to build a nest again and I wanted to try him out. Well, he did not return at first. There is something in this that told him to go away and I liked that. Maybe its a scent thing, I'm no mouse expert, but it saved me another dead one in a trap so far. So, that's two.I didn't try this on deer, so I cannot profess to that. Just wanted to note that as well, although there haven't been any deer here. Maybe they psychically knew and just avoided it beforehand. So much smarter than rabbits.",1344816000,2012-08-13
5.0,"I've used it about 3 times now and it is extremely powerful especially compared to the 18 Volt WORX that recently died after only approximately two and a half years.I don't know what the future holds for it, but thus far is perfect!!",1392249600,2014-02-13
5.0,"I am impressed. The little bit of set-up was a snap. The manual is helpful. Getting ready to use this takes only a few minutes (as long as you already have some bar & chain or 30W oil).Using it is also simple. Using it can also be dangerous. Getting used to the jaw and the timing of starting and stopping the chain takes a little practice.I used this pruning and cutting up everything from twigs to 3.5"" limbs. It cut them all quickly and cleanly. I made over 50 cuts of at least an inch and there was no sign of the battery weakening.Next up is 80' of hedge. Though the limbs aren't ""large"", they are too large for my hedge trimmers (also B&D; 18v).There a few negatives, but nothing to even cost it part of a star. There is no oil reservoir. You periodically add oil from a plastic squeeze bottle (supplied). Also, even though it is very well balanced, it is heavy (at least for a 66 year old guy with bad legs and back). I had to take frequent breaks.I have several of the B&D; yard tools in this series and they have all been a pleasure to use.",1317945600,2011-10-07
5.0,"This company makes all different sizes of covers for various sorts of outdoor furniture and appliances.  This particular one, the ""Large 64 inch"" grill cover, is clearly intended for Weber's line of gas grills.  It's really tough to know which grill cover goes with which grill.  After reading a few Amazon reviews, I bought the Large 64-inch to cover my new Weber Summit 470.  The prior reviews were correct: the cover fits perfectly in terms of shape, width, and depth.  However, in terms of height, it is about 6 inches too short to touch the ground.  That makes it tough - not impossible - to slip the hold-fast straps around the caster wheels; and it means that low spray (as from a lawn sprinkler, or a large amount of rain runoff) will be hitting your grill instead of the cover.  On the other hand, that means that air will be circulating in your grill's bottom compartment, where things like the drip pan live, and if you live in a mild climate that's probably a good thing.  When the covered grill gets rained on, the grill won't get wet, unless we're talking about a torrential downpour and gale-force winds; in which case, you'll want the deeper, XL-sized cover to prevent moisture entry in the bottom cabinet.The cover itself is made of a sturdy canvas-like cloth, quite tough, properly vented with rainproof vents, doesn't leak water, and is well fitted.  It has two handles, four holdfast straps to go around the casters, and the hem has an elastic drawstring.  It's easy to get on and off the grill even if you're doing it alone.  There is even a zippered pocket that goes across the top, although it's not clear to me what you'd want to keep in there - I don't use it.I'd buy this cover again, but I live in a very moderate climate in California.  If I lived in Green Bay, I'd send it back and exchange it for the XL sized cover.",1283990400,2010-09-09
5.0,"It took only a couple of days for the hummers to find this feeder and accept the liquid. That's the bottom line on hummingbird feeders. Do they work? Does it attract hummingbirds? Yes this one does.I really like the large reservoir, a full 24 oz capacity, making the juice last a long time. No funnel needed to fill this top-loading, wide-mouth, hummingbird feeder. The lid screws on and off with ease and has a dip in the lid forming a rainwater catching ring to keep ants from climbing down the hanging wire and stopping up the feeder holes. Even comes with a metal s-hook for hanging.My one dislike is the fact that the reservoir is made of glass. It's strong glass, but if dropped it will break. Of course if a plastic one is dropped while loaded, it will likely break as well.The base also separates easily for cleaning when needed. As long as the ants do not get inside, the feeder can be refilled a few times without cleaning, I have found. Perches below the white and pink plastic blossoms containing the feeder holes are enjoyed by the hummers. I've found, the feeders with perches are used more often than a hummingbird feeder with no perches.My wife makes our nectar soup. 4 parts water to one part sugar, heat to boiling, cool completely, and then fill. With all the red on this feeder, it is not necessary to add red food coloring to the nectar. The red on the feeder attracts the hungry birds.Our large capacity hummingbird feeder hangs about 18 inches outside our kitchen window, under an overhang. It is a delight to get to watch the hummers up close through the window. With the window cracked open a bit, you can even hear the wings humming as they arrive and leave. And occasionally hear a squeaking chirp, yes hummers do chirp, not hum.Our ruby throated friends love this feeder.Who can argue with a hummingbird?",1369958400,2013-05-31
4.0,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup, which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers, this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much.",1378166400,2013-09-03
5.0,"We just staked some of our tomatoes and two Knock Out roses with these. Unlike another reviewer our stakes were solid, the same kind you get at your local big box hardware store.  We did sink the stakes about 6 inches in the ground (just like we do other stakes).  We did the roses because they are so filled with blooms they needed support.  It was nice these were green because they aren't visible at all. We found ours locally.",1304812800,2011-05-08
3.0,"The theory behind these traps is that a dead mouse - killed by means other than the ""Kill & Seal"" disposable trap - could let loose parasites and germs that might move on to our pets or our children and that dead mouse urine or blood could trigger asthma reactions. Enter (not literally) ""Kill & Seal"" where mice come in because they smell the bait (not included) inside and are quickly killed, out of sight and sealed in so that nothing, not even germs or little parasites can get out. The trap and its victim can then be safely and hygienically disposed and a new trap can be set to catch the next mouse candidate.Operation is easy. There is a corked opening through which 'bait' is dropped into the trap. Pulling a lever will set the trap and open the door. After the mouse enters to investigate the door closes shut and the mouse is smashed dead but we don't see that unless we remove the cork through which we inserted the bait. It should be practically impossible or very difficult to reuse these traps once a mouse is caught and attempting to do so would defeat the trap's purpose of preventing germs and parasites from jumping on us.While these traps appear to be effective - one of them caught what was probably the last uncaught mouse left in our basement - they are expensive too. Dealing with more than a few mice by means of disposable Kill & Seals may not be a practical or cost-effective solution.I will grant these Made in China traps 3 stars (they are Okay) for being effective and innovative. Two stars are deducted for them lacking affordability.",1292889600,2010-12-21
5.0,"When you get a product to drive critters away from your property (or garden, in our case), the stuff needs to do two things well:1) Repel critters2) LastHavahart Critter Ridder Animal Repellent does both very well, and while it does cost a bit, it's worth it if you're concerned about the havoc wild animals can do to your yard and garden.Highly recommended!",1343088000,2012-07-24
4.0,"For a long time I have been searching for a reasonably squirrel / raccoon-proof suet feeder, especially to provide our little winged guys with some useful winter supplements.  To add to our Brome Squirrel-Buster Plus and Brome Peanut + feeders.  Several suet feeders, on previous occasions, had succumbed to the destructive powers and smarts of our local raccoon families.  Unquestionably, a raccoon would destroy this feeder as well, except for the fact that I hung it in a manner and place virtually inaccessible to a raccoon (even if every neighborhood raccoon is sponsored by Nike and lives by &#8220;You Can Do It!&#8221;).  Thus far, the birds are just getting acquainted with the Stokes Double Suet Feeder.  I notice a winged patron on occasion (to my excessive delight), but can&#8217;t say that it is well-frequented thus far.  Most prefer the other feeders yet.  If / when a little one is located in the double suet feeder, the feathered friend appears to pick away comfortably and seemingly relatively relaxed.  In summary: I welcome this addition to my bird feeders, without (yet) being ecstatic about it.",1388620800,2014-01-02
3.0,"The Sun Joe SB600E Sharper Blade 4.5 Amp String less Electric Grass Trimmer/Edger reviewed here is very Wobbly (It vibrates a lot) and noisy and hard to get used to as you feel tired because of the vibrations using it. It also feels heavier than most String trimmer/edger because of these unwanted vibrations.While it may be conceptually a good idea as it does not need string replacement but it has a major design flaw as the motor is severely underpowered and gets compounded by the semi stiff space age plastic blade whenever it comes in contact with cutting materials like grass or weeds.IMHO, The Plastic blade is not dead center on the motor and it wobbles a lot causing severe vibrations for the person who attempts to use this productI also found that the motor does not have enough power to cut thru' simple grass as even a slight touch on the grass slows the motor down which makes it useless. The Blade may last few months as it does not seem to erode quickly but if you do the math the cost of the blade is still high close to $30 compared to Strings (less than $5) which you can buy and replace easily.Before using this I have used Homelite 13 inch. 4 Amp String Trimmer/Edger which is not sold on Amazon but in local hardware store for less than $30 dollars and had excellent results with it.I still feel that the idea of using ""string blade"" is best as you have virtually unlimited cutting power and you can easily sacrifice the string and keep going at the weeds and grass once you reload them.Sorry! Sun Joe Good Concept, But poor design! - I would not recommend this to anyone!**** Update ****Aug 25, 2011**** ****** ****While most of the points that I had mentioned above are still true, I did give this Edger another try last weekend to clean out some overgrowth and dirt off my backyard. I attempted to re-install the blade again by mounting properly and some of the vibrations were minimized. While it still got under-powered easily if you come close to the intended areas for cleanup, I noticed that by carefully balancing the trimmer and putting it down more slowly and allowing the motor to gain strength I was able to complete my task by some added balancing acts.Having said, I am going to add one star to the original review as it deserves a ""OK"" Status, Simply because the sheer size of the blade, I could clean-up a larger area than possible with a ""string blade"" trimmer/edger.Hope this helps!",1311897600,2011-07-29
4.0,"Like other reviewers, I purchased these stainless steel flavorizer bars to replace my rusted enameled bars.  After two years of average use (grilling once a week or so during the summer), as I was cleaning my grill I realized that these stainless steel bars are rusty...quite rusty, on both the top and bottom.I was surprised, so I contacted Weber customer service about the rust on the stainless steel bars.  They explained, and I quote:""The flavorizer bars will rust within the first year of use. This is normal due to the amount of abuse they take protecting the burner tubes. We recommend that you replace the bars once they break or fall apart. I would suggest rotating the bars for a longer longevity.""Fine.  No problem.  Based on Weber's recommendation, I assume the flavorizer bars are still doing their job, even if rusty.  However, I now believe I was too hasty in replacing my old bars.  And, when it's time to replace the stainless steel bars, I may just replace them with the less expensive porcelain enameled bars.",1276819200,2010-06-18

4.0,"I have a fiskars hand shovel, but what I really wanted was a larger soil scoop with more capacity, this isn't it. It was smaller than I expected.  It's very well made, I do like this material for hand tools (lighter), and if you do not already have something to transfer soil for smaller job I recommend this scoop.

4.0,"I've used several Miracle Gro potting mixes and soils over the years and have never been disappointed. This one is no exception. Since I don't tend to fertilize my plants and garden myself, the addition of the fertilizer in the soil is helpful.The soil is easy to work with and pot my plants in.The one thing I didn't like was all of the random bits in the soil - twigs, sticks, what looks like wicker pieces, mulch etc. It's obviously composted from other material, which is OK, but I didn't care for the un-broken down pieces in the mixture. I feel like it's filler material they add so they can get away with selling less actual product.Everything I have planted in this soil is doing well - no problems and no complaints. I was able to pot several of my herbs with this one bag; about 25 of my seedlings were moved to 4"" pots and I still had a bit of soil left over.Price is decent, too!",1395964800,2014-03-28

5.0,"I had a sears reciprocating blade pole saw, that cut very nice and clean, but broke after 10 minutes of use (I tried 2 before returning it for my money back).

3.0,"I was hoping that these truly would have been the ultimate plant clip, but alas, it turns out that this is not the only clip I will ever need. The Global Garden Friends' Ultimate Plant Clip is an interesting concept at its core. These are certainly fine clips for tomato plants, or for any other small plant in need of a stake, supposing there exists enough girth between the plant and stake to hold the clip in place, or if there is a lateral branch on which the clip may rest; otherwise, these smooth, plastic clips will not hesitate to slide down.These clips have inner dimensions of almost a half an inch across the short length, by barely over one inch across from tip to snap. Closing them is a snap, quite literally, and they open up inch a pinch, also, quite literally.I believe these add a bit of whimsy to any plant on which they can stay in place; the theme is spot on. However, function is of utmost importance, and without friction of some sort to hold a clip in place, an alternate solution oftentimes becomes necessary.I enjoy the clips, but their application is somewhat limited. I eagerly look forward to using these on my next crop of tomatoes, but this did nothing for my poor little Orchid. I recommend these clips for situations in which these will be able to maintain their posts, so to speak, supposing cost is no factor, keeping in mind that they are no replacement for traditional ties. These Ultimate Plant Clips are ideal for those considering them more for either their aesthetics or their novelty, rather than for functional convenience.",1389312000,2014-01-10

The price on Amazon is also over HALF the price in any pet store.  I just bought a bag today at a pet store because I didn't want to suffer the wrath of 12 little beady eyed terrors because they didn't get their hit today, and I paid $12 for a 7 ounce bag.  Argh!  Definitely going to order some more right now...gotta make sure I've got happy chickens to get happy eggs!  According to my hens - HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!",1334793600,2012-04-19

5.0,"I live in an old house with woods close by and we have always got mice from time to time.  These always work great for us.First we check to see if there's anyplace they are getting in - we had a problem with a hole around the stove outlet- if you've got something like that, fill it with the spray foam if you can - that really helped us.Then, put the traps out close to where you think they are getting in, or close to where you see them- they tend to like to run along the baseboard or in the corners we notice.  Put out MULTIPLE traps along their route.We use peanut butter on ours.  We smear it on the little yellow thing.  Go to bed- or in another room and turn off the lights- listen for the SNAP. They are cheap enough to throw the WHOLE thing away.Usually they kill the mouse dead.  We have had one occasionally NOT kill the mouse.  We take it outside and it it with a bat so it dies immediately.  That's the only bad thing about these traps - if they don't kill the mouse, it can suffer.  They usually do kill it right off though.You can't beat a good cat that's a good mouser- that's the only thing I know that's been better than these traps.  Bait works pretty good too- if you aren't concerned with other animals or kids getting into it.  I had one of those expensive $90 electric traps but it didn't work well at all.If these don't work for you - try smearing the yellow with peanut butter- smear it so they can't get a chunk off and run.",1401667200,2014-06-02

3.0,"Ahh summer time in South Carolina!  I love fresh produce and always keep some in the house year-round.  Of course every summer the fruit flies find their way to my home too.I usually keep a tiny jar (Baby Food) on the kitchen windowsill with red wine vinegar and soap to trap the little buggers.  It usually does the trick pretty well, but its not that attractive to look at.When I saw this little Apple shaped trap, I thought, oooh pretty!  That would dress up my kitchen window and serve a needed purpose as well.Upon its arrival, I opened the package and read the very simple instructions.  Just pull off the lid, discard it and fill the chamber with the bait liquid.  Simple huh?Well I pulled and tugged but no way that lid was coming off, it wasn't cut out.  Finally, I took a razor blade knife, sliced the top off, and then proceeded to fill.I placed this little apple on the window sill and waited.  Now a week later the chamber has attracted and trapped numerous victims.  Its done the job!This would be a much welcome addition to my kitchen if it was refillable, and not disposable.

5.0,"I have one very good and expensive pair of scissors that I reserve for fabric, but every other pair of household scissors I've owned seems to be made to be disposable.  Use it a while then replace it with a new, sharp pair.  I use scissors for everything from paper and fabric to household projects.  I know I'm not supposed to grab a pair and cut thin wire or plastic clam shells, but I do and I'd guess most people do something similar.  Once you cut a thin wire with your regular scissors once, they never work properly again.Fiskars Ultimate Multi Purpose Scissors are different.  I've never used a pair of scissors that held up to any project without suffering before, but this model of Fiskars pulls it off.  The first thing I cut was a piece of corrugated cardboard.  I frequently trim cardboard packing boxes, which can be tedious and box cutters are not always the best option.  The cuts were smooth with this pair of Fiskars.  I then tested them on a variety of fabric weights from sheers to blanket fleece and woolens and they cut evenly and cleanly every time.  I cut twist ties and thin jewelry wire and found no damage to the scissors from the wire, as they cut paper without flinching afterwards. Obviously a wire cutter is still the better option, but it's good to know that an occasional misuse of these scissors will not damage them.They come apart for cleaning, which is a nice detail for household scissors.  The safety shield for the scissors is feature packed.  There is a built in sharpener which is easy to use.  I love the tape cutter which allowed me to easily and safely open a tightly taped shipping box without a box cutter.  I even appreciate the two tone color of the handles, which helps me locate the pair quickly amongst my other orange handled scissors.  However, I really don't need any other scissors anymore other than this pair and my good fabric shears.I don't know that the bottle opener was really necessary, considering how few bottles these days require an opener.  But it's there if I need it.Overall, I'm very happy with this pair of scissors.  I can't believe I never had a pair like this in the past.  Every household needs a pair of well made multi-purpose scissors.  I'm sure if I had these long ago, I would not have run through so many pairs in the past.  This will be much better on the wallet as well as the environment.",1306368000,2011-05-26
4.0,"While cleaning out the basement this spring, I noticed some signs that mice had been there at some point. I selected this product in order to eliminate any of the critters that might still be living in my basement and to prevent others from taking up residence. I have not seen any consumption of the bait bar, so perhaps they've all moved on, but I will keep checking it. I've not seen any dead mice inside or outside either.According to Wikipedia, Bromethalin ""is a rodenticide which poisons the central nervous system ... This damage to the central nervous system can cause paralysis, convulsions, and death.""  As pointed out in other sources, there is no antidote for this poison so that's why the protective covering that is child and pet resistant is very important. Some other products use a warfarin substance which causes them to hemorrhage. I've used those substances before and I know they work.The reason I like this over traps is because I don't like to take a chance on hurting myself while setting in the bait, and I don't like seeing the captured and dead mouse in the trap or disposing of it. I hope that if this works and if mice do eat it and go off elsewhere to die that they do indeed go outside. The opening into the bait station is very small and the mouse will have to go inside in order to eat the bait.I will update if I see any results or if I notice the bait is nibbled. I'm hoping it takes care of the problem as I like a hands-off approach to ridding my home of pests though I don't like to disturb anything that is outside the house unless absolutely necessary.",1403740800,2014-06-26

The little plastic apple dispenser is much cuter than my usual method. The solution in the kit just fills the little apple. Certainly, the solution attracts fruit flies, but not all that well. Terro's instructions suggest that the solution works for a month. Maybe not so much. After a few days, I put the little apple side by side with my usual ramekin of cider and soap, and guess which one attracted more fruit flies. Yep.

5.0,"We live out in the country, so it is no surprise that we have mice - and at certain times of the year, LOTS of them. You can always tell when the population is high, because there will be increased amounts of droppings and bits of insulation etc just strewn about in odd places. The mice harbor in our attached garage and rummage up through the insulation and ultimately come into our kitchen cabinets and closets. Ugh, it is just GROSS.We have used countless glue traps, which we have to then go and round up and dispose of, a few different types of poison - pellets and blocks (which turn the mice feces blue btw) and when you use the poison you just don't know where and when the mice will die. So they are just rotting off somewhere - GROSS! If you do find them, then you have to scoop them up and dispose of them.There have been plenty of days through all these years of living here, that we would put out 10-15 of the glue traps.. We put them in closets, cupboards, drawers, and down in the closets in the garage... and the next day ALL the traps had mice stuck to them. Some of them would have 2 mice stuck since it seemed that sometimes another thoughtful little guy would come along to help the first one and end up stuck himself. The glue traps and poison aren't too expensive unless as in our case you have to buy them constantly. So, then buying something more like this Victor Multi Kill seems alot more economical, even though the price tag seems steep compared to a pack of glue traps.The Victor Multi Kill is SUCH a relief. It makes disposing of the mice so much easier.. no running around trying to remember where all the glue traps are and then seeing the little guys STILL ALIVE squeaking their heads off. No coming across random dead mice due to eating poison and dying in a hidden spot in the house. I have come across mouse bones and fur obviously months and months after they have died and it is not fun. The multi Kill is so nice to have. You just set it up, let it do it's thing and then empty after a few days or so. If you have a larger house and or multiple areas of infestation, it is definitely worth it to have more than 1 Multi Kill. In our case, one in our garage closets and one in the main house area would be ideal with possibly a 3rd unit under our kitchen cabinets where the cat food is stored. At this point though, we have only tried out this one unit so far, but will pick up at least 1 more unit when we have some extra money.It is obvious that the device works since we can see the dead mice when we empty it. I feel it is definitely worth the money in the long run if you have an on going problem or if you have a sudden outbreak of mice. For the most part, if you have them once, you will have them again when the weather changes. It just makes more sense for us to spend the money in a lump sum and use the device repeatedly, for years to come, without any headaches, than to spend a few dollars repeatedly (adding up to more than the lump sum over time) and have all the extra work to do with disposal, round up, etc.We have had no problems with the device. It seems solid enough and it definitely gets the job done. Once we get a second unit, I will be even more relieved. So far we have been alternating the location of the 1 unit between the garage closets, under the kitchen cabinet, and in a closet in our closet hall (a hall full of nothing but huge walk in closets). I would love to have enough units to just let them all sit and do their job, as opposed to moving it around every week or so.The Multi Kill is definitely worth it's price and I do recommend it if you have a mouse problem.",1317081600,2011-09-27
3.0,"I purchased this exact model from my local ""Wal-Mart"" and actually paid more than I would have here, but I needed some clippers and fast.First off, they are not rigid at all..  What I mean is, as long as you are clipping a few blades of grass, you are ok, but really put it to use, and you soon find that it will lock blades and not function. This is due to the very poor construction.  Too much ""slop"" between the blades often make either both blades lock together or separate so much that nothing is cut.If you really want a good set of clippers that actually work, look further as this is a ""novelty"" item more than an actual functioning tool.",1372291200,2013-06-27
3.0,"First I must state that my 'for review' Tri-Kill hasn't killed or caught any mice yet. Our mouse-invasion season is usually October-November when field mice seek warmth and shelter in our basement which is a bad idea because they all end up caught.With that in mind, we developed a pretty good understanding of what works and what doesn't when it comes to mouse defense. The ultrasound deterrents, for example do not seem to work. Mouse traps do but mice are smart and it's unlikely you'll catch more than one mouse with the same trap placed at the same location and one trap rarely catches more than 2 or 3 even if you move it around the basement. What works with mice is 'variety' and a bait that's hard to resist and hard to get to, unless the mouse enters the trap. The Tri-Kill therefore adds to the 'variety' arsenal, which is a good thing and there's no way the mouse get get close to the bait - peanut butter - unless the mouse enters the trap, another plus. Now, will the Tri-Kill ever catch more than once mouse at a time? I am highly skeptical of that because, like I said, mice are smart and they learn fast so I can't imagine how mouse number 2 would ever try to get to the bait while mouse number 1 is dead or struggling but I will be happy to come back and update this review once I see 2 or 3 mice caught in the Tri-Kill.Finally, the makers claim that this is a no-touch design. Now, I don't know what the definition of 'no-touch' is but the trap has no floor so, whatever the mice do while dying (use imagination) is going to be left on the floor. It would be difficult to avoid touching the kill while disposing of it unless you wear gloves but then all traps could be called 'no touch'.Three stars, by the way, stand for 'It's OK'. I will improve my rating once I see actual mice being caught.",1364774400,2013-04-01
2.0,"Update, April 2014:  My original three-star review is posted below. I am updating to remove one star. A few weeks after posting my review, I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder, chowing down on bird seed. When I went out to chase him off, he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome, but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away. Squirrels are amazing acrobats, especially when there's good food to be had. This feeder will not deter them.Original Review:Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder, but in actual use the results aren't as good as I'd hoped. Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option. However, when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds, the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome. Then, while they were feeding, they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring, like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder. The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea, and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food. I've noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they're under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full. Once the level of seed drops, the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate. I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out, then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they don't have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill. I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate. However, the feeder only holds half a pound of seed, so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance. So far I haven't seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder, so I can't comment on that yet.",1394409600,2014-03-10

2.0,"So, we keep fruit and veggies in wire bowls on our kitchen counter.  We had a fruit fly problem recently as a result.  I was thrilled to receive this, in hopes that it would make a bigger dent in our fruit fly problem than our current strategies / actions / solutions.  Sadly, it did not.Now, it definitely DID catch fruit flies - just not enough to really matter, not particularly quickly, and not in the same quantities as basic homemade solutions did.On the whole, I was disappointed.  Compared to putting some wine in a clear container, sealing it with Saran wrap, and punching a few holes in the Saran wrap for the flies to get in (but not out), this product just didn't hold up.  In one or two days of the homebased solution  we caught multiples of the fruit flies we caught using this Terro Fuit Fly Trap.  Plus, the Terro trap is a one-time only / disposable  deal, which isn't exactly my favorite thing.So, while it did work somewhat, it really wasn't enough for me.  I wasn't impressed.

In practice the plastic parts were prone to breaking, and since I accidentally set off the trap, and was unable to reset it.Plus there was insufficient documentation with the traps so I didn't know you put peanut butter or cheese on the top of the trap door, instead I just threw a piece of cheese down the trap hole. I don't know if that was the reason, but caught no mouse in this trap while I manged to catch a mouse in a traditional mouse trap.And at $4 or more a trap these are hardly a bargain.Unless you are trapping around food, small children, or pets, I would stick with the tried and true traditional Victor wooden traps.",1287014400,2010-10-14

5.0,"I have one of these on each spray nozzle that I own so it is easy to change nozzles in a few seconds by popping one off and another on.  If a rubber washer is used, there is no leaking from this connector.  It is extremely easy to use.

The problem here is over a small amount of time (months), water hardness deposits and corrosion prevent the connector from locking into place with the female.  The smoothness of operation that it started out with, becomes rough, and a struggle over time. STAY AWAY FROM THE ""METAL"" ONES AND ONLY GO WITH THE TRUE BRASS ONES!!!I found an interchangeable solid brass connector like this at Ace HardwareACE BRASS QUICK CONNECTOR SET, also made by Gilmour that even has an automatic shutoff built in!  I also give that one a 5 star rating because you do not even have to shut off the hose to change between nozzles.  You can use regular Gilmour males with Ace Hardware females interchangeably. If you are going to fill buckets, I recommend this regular Gilmour brass connector, as opposed to that one, since that has the automatic shutoff feature which won't let you fill the bucket without a spray nozzle.",1317772800,2011-10-05

5.0,"Our backyard is a bald-patched embarrassment. I have tried several times (unsuccessfully) to reseed, overseed--pretty much everything short of actually having the whole thing ripped out and rototilled (if it were my lawn, and not my landlady's, I would). Because the dirt is so hard-packed and resists absorbing water, I got it in my head that aeration was the key. (My neighbor the gardener has a big machine, but I wanted to do this myself. I'm frugal like that.) I looked at several models and types at the local home stores, and finally decided to order this one. (In the interim, I ordered and tried theClean Air Distributing FLA1K20 Lawn Aerating Shoes. Let's call that an assistive device. I like the concept, at least.)As soon as the Yard Butler arrived we went out back and started poking holes in the ground. (Following the advice of other reviewers, I was careful about how I put pressure on the handle. In the harder areas, I found that a gentle back-and-forth or circular wiggle aided full insertion.) I was amazed at how incredibly dry the expelled plugs were. The Yard Butler and I covered the whole yard sparingly and then watered judiciously. The next day the task was easier and the plugs were somewhat moist. The next day it was even easier. I also used it in the flower beds to increase drainage around my trees and shrubs.Before I put it away, I knocked out the dirt, filed down the cutting edges and sprayed some lubricant on the tines. Once I've achieved a nice, tight pattern across the whole yard, I'll fill the holes with sand and overseed again with Bermuda. (Every other grass type dies off and Bermuda just keeps coming back, so why fight it? I did plant someWhite Dutch Cloverto add nitrogen, attract bees, and say, ""Take that, Bermuda!"")So far, I am very happy with this aerator. If one day I have a decent-looking lawn, I'll be even happier with it. And I will thank the Yard Butler by giving him his freedom.",1304812800,2011-05-08

It is difficult to know just how successful they have been as I don't know how much additional damage I would have gotten without them and I have never seen a deer touching a unit.  I have had plants less than 10 feet away eaten, so these will be added to my normal arsenal of spraying and fencing but not counted on as the only solution.  They would work best in a situation where the deer enter in one small area, like a driveway or gate.  Unfortunately, my local deer have numerous paths and seem to be passing these by. I did touch the units to make sure they are working and to see how bad the shock is (I have a puppy that I did not want harmed) and the it is very mild -  enough to scare, but not enough to cause any harm.

The contenders; Tomcat glue traps - a low tray filled with a sticky material that trap the mice when they walk on it, Kness Snap-E mouse trap; snap type traps that catch the mouse under a metal bar, the Victor Kill & Seal traps and a low tech trap involving a 5 gallon bucket with a wood board leaning up against the side and baited with peanut butter. You put a few inches of water in the bucket if you don't want to catch and release.I moved the different traps around in areas where there had been mouse activity so there would be no placement bias in the testing.The K&S; traps have very small openings for the mouse entry (11/16 by 11/16) and the bait plug (7/16 inch. You bait these traps by unscrewing a very small plug and putting some bait on it, I used peanut butter, and screwing it back in. It holds about 1/4 tsp of peanut butter. You move a lever to set the trap and it can only be set once so when I accidentally dropped one K&S; trap it triggered and it was no longer usable.  Of all the traps I set up the Kill& Seal was the only one that did not catch any mice. The last time I checked the one remaining trap the bait was gone and there was something rattling around in there that looked like a mouse poop.Bottom line:The bucket trap caught the most mice (5)The Tomcat glue traps were the second most consistently effective (4 mice)Close behind the Snap-E mouse traps (3 mice)The Victor Kill & Seal, no mice at all.",1292371200,2010-12-15

I've felled some pretty big branches.The saw blade is best either on or off.  Switching back and forth is not quick and easy.  It's screwed on with a wing nut, which gets stuck on me and requires the use of pliers.The saw blade is sharp and cuts quickly and easily.  I find it best to make the cut when I'm off to the side and not nearly underneath -- for safety's sake and also ease of use.The saw blade will get in the way when I'm trying to use the pruning feature.  If I were going to use it strictly as a pruner, I'd remove the saw.  Although its pruning blade cuts better than theFiskars 9234 62-Inch Pruning Stik, I like the Pruning Stik better.  The rope and pulley design of the Power-Lever Tree Pruner just doesn't do it for me.  I find it hard to use, especially when the branches are very tight.  The lever near the head gets stuck on the branches.  There just isn't room to pull.  I use this pruner when my Pruning Stik won't reach.

Each time I emptied the traps, I was amazed by the volume of the catch.  The trap is probably 6&#34; in diameter and 10&#34; or so tall, and they would be completely full of this little buggers (literally, little buggers).  This got me thinking that there isn't a lot of thinking that goes on inside the heads of Japanese beetles.  If you were out for a walk and saw a hole with about 10,000 people trapped in it, would you jump into it?  Of course not, but if you were a Japanese beetle, you'd think THE MORE THE MERRIER, and you would jump right in.  This trap provides yet another opportunity for parents to teach kids the hazards of doing what everybody else does, just because you were following the crowd.  One moment, you are flying around enjoying the world, the next minute you are stuck in a trap and you are too dumb to get out of it, even though it doesn't have a door or cover on it.So, in summary, this product works great, and it provides a great metaphor for life.",1376265600,2013-08-12

Well, I don't know about &#34;forever&#34; because I still haven't gotten used to the poor directions and the slipshod quality!Those &#34;directions&#34; are small pictures of the assembly steps, with no text to speak of.

The animal will dig the food and be trapped so long as he's in close enough.It is very important to check that an animal isn't nursing. If it is a nursing mother, it should be released immediately.Another very important precaution is to check the cage often especially in extreme temperatures and conditions where the animal could be overcome by heat or freeze or starve.

5.0,"Several reviewers have reported problems with this trap, such as the trap not being strong enough to actually kill the rat.  I wonder how many times this happened to each of these reviewers before they concluded the trap doesn't work properly.  No trap works perfectly every time, but I've had a lot of experience with rat traps, and I can assure you this one works better than most.I've deployed six different types of traps: two types of glue traps, the old standby classic by Victor, a knock-off of the Victor, an elaborate and beautifully designed, Japanese-made cage to trap them alive, a second kind of live trap, and the Tomcat.  I've caught quite a few rats, so I can claim a little expertise on this subject.As I said, no trap will work perfectly every time in every situation, or they wouldn't have invented so many different types--we'd all just use the classic wood-and-metal type, which doesn't cost very much, and be happy and rat-free.  Each has its purpose--except for some that in my experience don't work: I haven't caught a single rat in the cheap Victor-type knock-off.  In all of the others, I have, but the Tomcat has been the most successful.  So I assure you, it does work, at least when I've use peanut butter as bait.Second, it it easy to set.  No need for worries about getting your fingers caught (and some of these traps can inflict some real pain). Once the trap is cocked open, it stays open; you don't have to be super-careful every time you get within two feet of it for fear it's going to snap.  The bait is inserted into a removable little tube, so you can take the tube out, put in the bait, put it back in without setting the trap, or even while the trap is already set, without a problem.Third, being plastic, it doesn't rot or get very rusty outside; the Victors do both eventually. You can even wash it once in a while, which is probably a good idea if you catch rats in it. (There's a spring in the Tomcat that does rust, but very slowly.)Fourth, it's reasonably priced, and unlike glue traps, it's endlessly reusable, doesn't catch any and all living things (bugs, frogs, roaches, lizards, whatever) that may wander across it, or present you with a glued living rat you have to get rid of.I did have one rat that got caught by the leg, and it was not a happy situation, least of all for the rat, which I put out of its misery.  But the same thing happens with every kind of snap trap once in a while.  As for the spring not being strong enough, tell that to the many rats that have been killed instantly in my Tomcat.",1271808000,2010-04-21

3.0,"This is my second timer and turns out this one is more primitive than the other similarly priced timer.  I did not realize the limitation from reading the package.I liked:1. simple to use2. has manual override3. big easy to see digital read out and dial4. works on two AA batteries, so I am able to use rechargeable AA batteries that I prefer for all my battery powered items.I don't like:1. Programming mode is very limited. The minimum time period you can set it up for is every 6 hours. It has to be exactly 6 hours apart.  My first timer gives me full control over when the waterings occur.  For example, I do not want to water in the middle of the night as might promote root rot. But I do want to water more frequently during the day in the middle of hot summer.  This timer does not give that type of control.This Orbit timer controls a new branch of my drip irrigation system. I am attaching a photo which shows my set up.The house spigot has a Y to which the first timer (the timer that I like better by DIG) and a short utility hose is attached.The short utility hose has another Y which is attached to this timer, the second end of the Y goes to a garden hose.Both timers are connected to 1/4 tubing (via various fittings such as pressure regulator, hose-to-tube adapter, filter, backup flow controller) that waters my plants via a drip irrigation system.  The second Y and timer are placed on an old planter to hold them off the ground.  All connections are made with the aid of Teflon tape.  This set up works very well - no leaks, easy to get to all the switches.  The use of a short utility hose allowed me to expand the system in a way I could not fit on one spigot and without throwing away the original timer that I really like.The Orbit timer with the exception of the programming shortcoming described earlier works well.  If you plan to water once a day, this is a perfect timer.  If you wanted a more complex watering schedule this is not the best option.7/30/11Less than a month after the initial installation I noticed that my hydrangea (watered by this timer) is looking a bit wilted. I went to water it manually and realized that I could not do it because the unit was blinking ""low battery"".  My other timer, also powered by chargeable batteries, run several summers on one set of batteries, so I was quite surprised to find that this timer drained my batteries in less than a month.  This is a heads up to keep your eyes on the batteries, this timer seems to use quite a bit of juice.9/10/11This timer used too much power to run on rechargeable batteries. I had to switch to non-rechargeable batteries and change them once a month.

We have one kind of short, thistle-like weed that is hard to grip with gloves. This keeps my hands away from it and gets it right out of the ground.You don't have to bend over.You can get out tougher weeds, such as dandelions, which have a long, deep taproot.Some not-so-good points:Eventually, when the taproot grows very deep, you will only get the top half, and the weed does eventually spring back.Once your ground gets very hard, this will only pull off the top half of the weed. We live in a relatively arid region (between two bays, so we get wind but the rain drops elsewhere.) If it's a dry spring or if it's summer and we've had no rain for weeks, this is difficult to use. The ground is too hard and the weed is too well imbedded into the soil.Still, it's short work to trundle around the yard with this in early Spring and pull out newly-sprouted dandelions while the ground is still soft. It's a pleasure to use. I can't think of another yard tool quite like it.",1365552000,2013-04-10

You really do get what you pay for in seeds. The local stuff has empty hulls, small stones and dirt, stems and chaff and seeds the birds throw out...probably duds. So, it probably costs as much as Wagner's, and it makes twice the mess. Plus, you have to fill the feeder more often with cheap feed, because so much of what you put in is junk,",1391040000,2014-01-30

It comes with a nice hook to hang it with.  One feature I really liked about this is they put a dip in the top that you're supposed to fill with water, when you do this, it traps/drowns ants who may be trying to climb down the feeder to get to the sugar water.  It's also SUPER easy to fill. You just take the top off, fill it up, and screw it back on, no fuss at all! Overall, this is a great feeder!",1370044800,2013-06-01
4.0,I just bought one at my local hardware store and was pleased at their size and quality. The picture doesn't do them justice. They seem to be heavy duty. I sprayed them with Pam to help with cleanup. They fit the baby-back ribs I bought at Costco just fine. I cut my ribs in half and since I had 3 sets of ribs put two in the rack and leaned two on the sides. If you cook them in the middle of the weber you could probably put up to 4 sets in the rack although they would stick out on the sides.,1303430400,2011-04-22
4.0,"It took me a few minutes of tinkering to figure out how to get the spreader operational.  The instructions were a little hard for me to comprehend and some of the pieces were difficult to move.  Basically, you are twisting the bottom of the container and it pops off.  It feels like you are breaking it, but you are not.  Once I was able to get the container open and the battery installed, it was really easy to use.  If you look at the picture, the yellow thing on the bottom is the on off switch and the fertilizer comes out the bottom front.  It was very easy to use.  I have a very complex yard with a variety of landscaping.  I wanted to apply this only to the grassy areas and had no problem limiting it to those areas and avoiding the flowers and shrubs that I wanted to use a different mix on.  As I said in the summary, this particular mix is very high nitrogen and almost nothing else.  Depending on what your lawn needs, this might or might not be a good solution.  However, the package is designed so you can use it over and over with whatever fertilizer you want to use.  For this, I give it 4 stars!",1403827200,2014-06-27
4.0,"If you need a standard leaf blower/vacuum, this one is not the right one for you.  It is most definitely a lightweight, both in its actually weight and in the job it does..It charges quite quickly.  It claims a full charge in two hours or an 80% charge in one hour, but mind registered a full charge in much less than two hours.  The downside of this is that it isn't too long before it needs recharging.  But again, this is a lightweight, not meant for those heavy rain-soaked oak leaves on the back lawn.It is a ""sweeper,"" which means it is a blower, no vacuum capability.  It won't work with the kazillion tiny mesquite leaves on my rocks but works just fine for cleaning the patio.  However, when I rounded those same kazillion leaves into a pile, it was not strong enough to blow them all together against the wall for easy pickup, just not powerful enough to move larger amounts of leaves.It has an adjustable power setting, but for me, it was pretty much useless at anything other than maximum, which means the battery will discharge more quickly.I especially like that it is cordless, there are no worries using it around water.It's easy to assemble but I couldn't get the end piece of the tube pushed in far enough so that it clicked on the little tab that is supposed to lock it in place.  So far, it has held the way it is, and maybe I can get it attached as it should be after it loosens up a bit.This one is not going to replace my bigger, and much heavier, corded vacuum/blower but it is great for little jobs",1365120000,2013-04-05

(birds were surprised, but uninjured and released healthy) We have have many species of rodents around our house, but only two create a health problem or damage problem.  This trap humanely captures all of them, and allows us to release the non-harmful rodents uninjured.  The harmful rodents can then be euthanized humanely. This is the most humane and effective process for small animals I've found so far. Yes, the trap can trip from strong winds, and yes it can be tripped without a catch. It's also a one-shot deal so you get one animal per setting. We can live with this - nothing is perfect. The trap can be a little frustrating to set if you've had too much coffee as well, but you get the hang of it.Update 7/10/12Be careful not to get the ""Grips"" livetrap which is a knock off of Havahart. The trigger wire does not have a flat spot which makes it very difficult to set and it trips without trapping frequently. Grips also appears to fall apart easily.  The Havaharts have been catching mice, voles, chipmunks and ground squirrels more effectively than any other trap.  Is also completely humane. We're only after the mice and voles (they damage things) so we let the others go without injury. CHECK YOUR TRAPS OFTEN or these become quite IN-humane.",1337644800,2012-05-22
4.0,"I put off getting a leaf blower for years, not wanting yet another tool in the garage if it would just take up space more often than it was used. I finally broke down last fall and picked up this model at Sears on sale, figuring that it would be useful for mulching leaves and it would beat using my lawn mower to blow the grass off the driveway and road after mowing (which works better than you might think).I knew that I didn't want a wimpy blower, so I researched models for the most CFM and the best reviews for durability and performance. I knew that I wanted something with a metal impeller for mulching, as plastic impellers just didn't seem up to task, and a variable speed control was also important. I also wanted something with a decent warranty in case I had any troubles. That research led me to this model. It's a popular model in sale ads, so if you keep your eyes open, you can get it for less than sixty.I would have been quite happy to buy this unit here on Amazon, but Sears had it for the better price, and with some things, it's also nice to be able to walk into a store and pick it out. You also have a little easier time returning/exchanging it if there is an issue.That turned out to be a good choice, as I ran into trouble on the third time I used it. The variable speed controller malfunctioned, and it became the equivalent of an on/off button, as it was either off or on at full speed.After considering whether to call Toro to get it fixed/replaced under warranty, I figured I would give Sears a chance to take care of that for me. I brought everything in (including the box) with my receipt from two months previous, and they allowed me to exchange it for a brand new model off the shelf. That's the kind of customer service that keeps brick and mortar stores relevant!I've been using that replacement for nearly a year, and I've had no troubles with it, so I'm willing to chalk up that first unit to a random part failure and not an indictment of the product in general. It is something to keep in mind when you are selecting where to purchase such an item, however.From a performance standpoint, I'm very happy with how it functions as a blower. It makes easy work out of blowing the grass clippings back onto the lawn, and I even use it to sweep across clumped grass so that it doesn't dry in a large mass and kill the lawn beneath. There's a large volume of air that comes out of the nozzle at the highest speed setting, and this means that there's a large volume of air being sucked into the intake at the bottom. Be sure to keep loose clothing away from this inlet!Converting to vacuum operation is quite easy, and it works very well. The bag could be another color besides white, as mulched leaves will discolor the bag pretty quickly. If the leaves that you are cleaning up are even a little wet, that moisture is going to stain the bag and it's not going to look out-of-the-box new ever again. Not a big deal to most of us, but something to keep in mind and something for Toro to consider when sourcing this bag in the future.Overall, I'm very happy with this power tool. It does everything I expect it to do, and it's definitely much lighter than a gas-operated equivalent. While it does produce a fair bit of noise due to its funtion, it's not so annoying that I feel like I need earplugs when using it. It was money well spent!",1315872000,2011-09-13

5.0,"Another update:  July 6.  Well my almost 2 month old lopper continues to get heavy use.  Very different from a chainsaw.  Cuts smaller stumps right to ground level-read my full review.  My neighbor, who never takes care of his property, has a poorly maintained pine.  I recently had a tree trimmer slice the branches on my side.  Now the best part.  I used a pressure washer to expose the large roots on my side.  I then used the lopper to cut out 6 inch sections from all those roots.  The main artery on my side-gone. You can do this becuse the non-cutting side of the lopper allows you to get under the root, and the chain side then slices it apart.  Not a possible task with any other tool.  My axe bounced off the large roots.  I cleaned and oiled the chain well after doing this task.  Love my lopper.  Original review below.The kit is a much better value.  Get it instead while it's available. I posted this review on the kit page. Just type lopper kit, on the Amazon search page.What's in the kit?, May 16, 2008By  P. Stein ""Bengals Fan"" (Beavercreek, OH) - See all my reviewsI just received my lopper today. I was very surprised and pleased with the kit. It contains: Black and Decker workgloves, safety glasses, a long outdoor extension cord, and a very high quality bag. I was expecting a cheap cloth bag. This looks like a high quality canvas or nylon denier bag with the Black and Decker name. Bag is worth $20-25. 50 ft 16 Gauge extension-$8, glasses and gloves - $5.00. Why would anyone buy the Lopper itself, instead of the kit? Go to the Lopper kit-sold on Amazon. Must be an item specially made for Amazon. Doesn't exist elsewhere. Kit is not well described in description. One extra point on the bag. It is so useful for organizing tools and keeping them clean, I wanted to buy more and googled it. Apparently it's not available separately. It is on EBAY, but bags are smaller and shipping is high. Makes this kit an especially good value.I have quite a few low growing shrubs I needed to remove. They are very mature and thick. The woody thick stems are too low and bunched for a chain saw, and my hand lopper wore me out. This is a perfect tool for this use. As others have commented, lube system is stupid. It is gravity fed, so you need to hold the jaws toward the ground and slowly add oil. I did that, but also generously hand (paper towel) oiled the chain and bar before each use, as you do for manual oiled chainsaws. Buy a quart of chainsaw bar oil. Lopper works great for intended purpose. Doesn't replace a hedge cutter. Works best for thicker (1/2 - 4 inch wood).  I just used it to remove 6 large mature shrubs.  They were 6 inches thick at the base, and I cut them going around in a circle.  Worked great. The very thin woody stems kept catching in the Lopper, but I could keep cutting, and removed them after the cutting. Use a Hedge trimmer on the thin stems, before you get to the lopper sized stems. You really need separate tools for each task. I have this lopper, a hedge trimmer, an electric chain saw, a gas chain saw, and a Fiskar pruner. Stay away from tools that claim to do it all. My preferred order of use is: 1. Hedge trimmer when possible-for speed and safety. 2. Lopper (for safety). 3. Electric chainsaw (for safety. 4. Gas chain saw (when all else fails).This is one of the most useful items I have ever purchased. I have been using it constantly since receiving it. I love the way you can cut small stumps right at ground level.  Just go around in a circle. I gave up on the oiler.  I heavily coat the chain with a paper towel soaked in bar oil. Stupid oiling system.  Otherwise-love it.",1211155200,2008-05-19
4.0,Using this product with my 2000 gpm pressure washer to clean aluminum siding on a two story house. Decided to clean one section with just the pressure water and the other with the Krud Kutter solution. Noticed a difference with the soap versus just the water. Upon closer inspection I noted that the Krud Kutter did clean better but there was still some dirt residue on the siding that did not wash away. The water only side did come cleaner but some of the heavier soiling was still present whereas the Krud Kutter was able to remove it.

5.0,"Because I live in earthquake country, I love owning this GOAL ZERO NOMAD 7 ULTRA-LIGHT SOLAR PANEL.  I hope that I'll never REALLY need to use it, but it's a wonderful addition to my emergency-preparedness equipment and supplies.  When unfolded and placed on a window ledge with the solar panels facing bright sunlight, it charges my Android smartphone quickly (adding a 15% charge in about 30 minutes).The NOMAD 7 is very light in weight, and is suitable for backpacking.  The device does NOT store a charge--the panels must be unfolded and exposed to sunlight for it to operate to charge any device.  How fast it charges depends in part on how much sunlight is reaching the panels.  It works best in direct sunlight, but it also worked for me on partly cloudy days.The built-in power port has connectors for charging 12V devices (Sherpa and others) and USB devices (cellphones and others).  You will need to supply the USB cables to connect your USB devices.The literature says that the panel will charge cellphones,  iPods, and tablets.  It works well with my Android smartphone; however, an iPod Touch (4th gen) delivered a message that the solar panel was incompatible, and my Kindle Paperwhite (2nd gen) repeatedly froze after beginning to charge (requiring a full reboot to be operational again after each attempt).  So I would recommend using the NOMAD 7 with care (stay with the newly connected device) until you find out which of your devices are completely compatible.  But it's still a great piece of equipment to have on hand for charging cellphones in emergency situations.",1387929600,2013-12-25

5.0,When I placed my order I had some misgivings about these hand pruners. That is because I could not tell by Amazon's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is. Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review. I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review. I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners. Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them. This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort. A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic. I immediately saw that I was wrong. All the parts that count are of high quality metal. I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them. They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate. They are SO EASY to use. Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones. They cut them with ease. The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch. I believe they could but I refuse to do it. I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them. I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers. I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job. I have never done that before with an Amazon product. That is how impressed I am with these pruners. If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs. I very much doubt I will have to do that.

Fillup is a little easier with the large-mouthed top (you've still got to be careful walking with it), and cleanup is simplified by the snap-apart design.  The perches are there and the overall appearance (at least by human standards) is more attractive than the previous large model with its more cylindrical shape.But of course the real proof is the birds.  In my experience the birds tend to stay away from a new feeder for a day or two.  Perhaps they're watching to make sure it doesn't turn into a cat or something.  But not with this one.  As soon as the birds were out and about, they were on this one.  Perhaps it's the bright white 'flowers'.  It would be interesting to know just how these flowers are designed, but the hummers seem to like these.  It's nice to keep them coming back.",1369872000,2013-05-30
4.0,"My four star ratings are based on the flimsiness of the product. It has to be handled with care. I like it because it is helping to keep the 1/4&#34; dripline in place.

1.0,"I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap. There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs. As a result, the flea trap is of no use to me. These refills are of no use to me as well  and that is why I can give only one star. They cost only $5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item. I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option.",1347148800,2012-09-09
5.0,"I currently have two geobins going in my backyard, but they were taking forever to compost. Part of this is my fault, as I don't turn the piles often enough. As a remedy to this, I decided a tumbler was the way to go. I was searching high and low for one when I came across this product on a Woot! deal. It was priced better than anywhere else so I decided to give it a try.It comes fully assembled and ready to go. A few other tumblers I read about require a great deal of assembly, including numerous screws that eventual rust or break. This product consists of a large bin and the base. You can set it up out of the box in less than a minute! The barrel does have some weight to it, roughly around 30 pounds empty.I have read a few reviews about the hole being too small to fit a shovel or other instruments in. I have not had this problem at all. I was able to transfer compost from my geobin piles into the tumbler with no problem whatsoever.My suggestion is to only fill the container half or 3/4 of the way. Empty it seems pretty heavy, but would quickly become unmanagable the more materials you put in it. I decided to put the tumbler next to my garden so it could get more sun. I rolled it from the compost piles to the garden. It wasn't the easiest thing to roll, but it did eventually make it (after knocking me in the shins a few times, ouch!) Even with it being only 1/2 full, this was quite a chore.The holes in the bin seem like they are a decent size. They are not large enough to allow scraps to fall out, but small enough to allow some rain water in. It seems to be the perfect size without oversaturating the compost materials.I would buy this product again in a heart beat. Turning it is super simple (I think my almost 2 year old could do it if he had a little more strength), and much quicker than turning a pile with a shovel. I can go through roughly 10 rotations in a minute if I wanted to.",1367366400,2013-05-01

It doesn't look to be any 'foam ring' in these 2.  BUT one can always stir 'foam packing peanuts' into dirt/potting mixture, which will create some lightness to over all hanging weight, as well as help with water retention.As to Fabric rotting/giving out after one season vs the earlier reviews.

5.0,"I buy hummingbird feeders locally whenever there are end of season sales.  Six or seven hang out in our very large yard at any given time; we've gone through many different styles and brands.  Best-1 hummingbird feeders have held up the longest (7+ years) and seem to be the hummingbirds' favorite.  As a matter of fact, the only time one failed is when a raccoon tried to drink out of one, the feeder fell, and the glass bottle broke.  With any other, you'd have to throw the whole thing away.  No problem here--replacement parts are made and sold.These feeders can be found elsewhere at cheaper prices, and replacements for either the glass top or plastic bottom can be bought separately.  Look up Nottawa Wild Bird Supply (can be found online) in Indiana.  They sell this 8 oz. feeder for $8, the base replacement for $5, or the 8 oz. glass top for $3.

3.0,"We live on a farm and have a constant war with the mice in the barn.  They chew into bags of feed and spill it.  But even worse, they pee and poop in the feed so you can't scoop it up and use it.  I used D-con poison for a while, but our dog knocked over a pallet that was blocking the entrance to the feed stall and ate some of it.  He had to be taken to the emergency vet because he was bleeding internally (he survived to cause trouble another day).  I've used glue traps, which worked somewhat, but tended to catch more crickets and spiders than mice.  Plus I didn't like that the mice died a long agonizing death once caught on the glue.  I've had the best luck with good old fashioned spring traps, which kill immediately, are inexpensive, and aren't dangerous to pets or children.I decided to give these bait stations a try, since they're pet and kid resistant.  I set up both stations in the feed room, and left two of my snap traps, just in case.  In three days I caught one mouse in the snap traps, but neither of the bait stations had even been nibbled, despite carefully selecting a place the mice like to run along a wall on their way to the feed.  I pried off the lids to make sure, but the baits had been ignored.So, I give the safe design of this product 5 stars, but the bait itself 2 stars, for a total of 3 stars.",1396224000,2014-03-31

3.0,"Arriving in a huge corrugated (and wrapped with sheet plastic) cardboard box, with the words ""Team Lift"" (great idea) on the outside, the table was somewhat well-protected during transit. A deep dent on the bottom of the box caused me some concern, which was allayed when I saw the Masonite squares within the box, reinforcing each corner - nothing within was damaged.The table arrived dent-free. However, while unpacking the table from the box, sheet metal screws were raining down on me. I thought that the plastic bag holding the hardware must have had a hole in it, but NO -- these were screws that were holding the resin planks to the metal bars(under the table) running perpendicular to the table. And since the planks are made of resin and the sheet metal screws are screwed directly into the planks, some screws had come loose and fallen out, some to the point of almost losing their ""grip"" in these resin planks. THIS will impact the longevity of this table for sure. I believe a threaded insert in the resin and then a round headed bolt with a Phillips slot-head screwed through the metal bars, and then into that threaded insert would have been much much sturdier and better in the long-term. So, Three Stars for this -- had the slats been more securely fastened, I would have initially given this table Four Stars.That being said, the table is handsome - and I am glad I have a 14 foot long balcony -- as this table is large -- wicker woven on a steel structure, surrounding faux wood planks. It is heavy -- and large enough to hold some plants as decor while still leaving plenty of room for food, be it potluck or pizza. The hole in the middle of the table -- for the umbrella -- is a great touch. The FOUR wicker-on-steel table legs (which I have yet to assemble onto the table) seem heavy enough to hold the table up, but I think SIX legs might be better than four -- more needs to be said about this, and once I attach the legs, I will be better able to judge this. I DO wonder if, when I add the patio umbrella (also sold by Strathmore Furniture), should a gust of wind twist it to and fro (despite the weighted base) would that make this Four-legged table fall over? To be determined, at a later date (mid-late Spring)......One plank seems to be longer than the other -- It is not flush with the edge of the table -- I took it apart and repositioned it to make it sit flush with all the others.I also keep a big heavy tarp nearby, to cover the table against inclement weather, as per the initial instructions. The biggest test, other than the screws' ability to retain their grip on the planks long-term, will be in the summer with its significant heat and humidity, and how THAT affects the table (warping? Mildew?).UPDATE-- Summertime!! The heat and humidity have been pretty bad for about 2 weeks. Things are better now. I have two fans on my balcony -- one of which is trained on the underside of this table. It helps. So far nothing has warped or mildewed.",1361836800,2013-02-26
4.0,"Beyond BBQ, this are a perfect tool for anyone cooking a Thanksgiving meal. Have you ever wanted to keep track of your food but still be with your friends? Just add the app to your phone, and it goes right with you.While we have used many variations of meat thermometers and alarms, this one is unique because in addition to having two probes which can be set separately, it also will connect with an app on your newer Bluetooth devices to monitor your food away from the kitchenI received a free sample to test for my review, so I put it through a few extra tests in order to write my review.I used boiling water to test the probe temperature along with my digital probe. Both probes on the thermometer measured within one degree of my own probe and one another.While these weren't slow by any means, they were slower in registering temperature than the digital probe that I use.After downloading the software, I was able to monitor the temperature in the living room on my iPhone.Overall, I was very impressed. I have chosen four stars (instead of five) because I found some of the instructions and documentation difficult to understand.

4.0,"This product is a great supplement to the physical weeding you have to do with a weedeater or other device.  What you have to do is to spray the plant on Monday to let the toxin be carried to the root center.  Then, on Wednesday, if you insist on whacking the weed and not just spraying, you can go and tear it down.  It's crucial that the intact plant have 1 or 2 days to take in this product.  If you cut if down and then spray it, you may well be spraying to no effect.  It must be absorbed by a functioning leaf to really take effect.  It does work, but you must take care.  It's impossible to have a spray just for weeds; plants are plants, so if you misfire onto your prized shrub, you'd better spray water promptly to ensure its viability.",1338336000,2012-05-30

1.0,"Perhaps the squirrels in my yard have developed a fondness for ""putrescent egg"" or find the allure of bird seed and budding leaves offsets the supposed repellent tastes and odor of ""Deer Off."" I've followed the direction, applied this product twice to the same plants, shrubs, and area. I coated the bird feeders and ground around them with Deer Off, and I also liberally applied it to the aerial access points via tree limbs and trunks, bushes, even stairs.The squirrels remain undeterred. They continue raiding the raised beds, climbing to the bird feeders, and generally seem unperturbed. If they were wearing clothes pins on their noses or had tiny gas masks, then that would be one thing. So I still have to dispatch the Aussies to chase the squirrels when I catch the varmints in the act.This repellent does work during the time I am actually spraying it on stuff to the point it coats surfaces and drips to the surrounding ground.

5.0,"We live in an area that loses power frequently, and when there's a big storm we can lose power for days at a time, so we have quite a collection of solar lanterns and chargers.  This Goal Zero Nomad 7 has become one of my instant favorites.  The craftsmanship and attention to detail are excellent.  The case has nine hanging loops, which provides a lot of options if you're using it while camping, and the case seals with a magnetic closure, which I find more convenient and less bulky than velcro.The Nomad 7 has two standard panels, each about the size of a half sheet of notebook paper, so it's about the size of a pad of paper fully opened.  It has three different outputs on the back:  A USB port, a dedicated cable to feed into a Guide 10 battery charger, and a 12v DC female socket (i.e., a ""cigarette lighter"" socket like in your car).  The 12v DC out is not included on any of my other portable solar panels -- it's a nice addition.  The panel also has an input to chain it to other Nomads.  The output/input connections are all in a single block, which is covered by a zippered mesh pouch on the back of the panel so you can keep all of your charging cables neatly stored with the panel.  The port labels are printed right on the case so you can't lose them -- a handy and smart detail.The Nomad 7 can charge some devices (like my phone) directly, but it won't charge my iPad directly.  To charge an iPad, you need to use the Nomad 7 to charge a battery pack (Goal Zero recommends the Guide 10 battery charger; I use an Anker 5V/2A external battery, which doesn't have removable batteries but is smaller and works great), then dump the charge from the external battery pack to your iPad.  This isn't just because the Nomad 7 doesn't pump out enough power, it's also because the iPad doesn't like power that fades in and out, which happens frequently as clouds cross the sun.  My Instapark 10w solar panel also needs an intermediate battery to charge my iPad reliably, even though the 10w panel is sufficient to charge the iPad directly on a completely clear, sunny day when the panel output doesn't fluctuate.Because it has two panels instead of three, the Nomad 7 is a bit smaller and lighter than the Instapark, and the 7w output seems to charge up an external battery pack very quickly.  During outages around the house, I'll use both, but for camping I would probably take the Nomad 7, both because it's a bit smaller/lighter and also because the build quality seems top notch.",1385769600,2013-11-30

4.0,"My mom has always had problems with moles in her yard.  Years ago, she tried the typical things -- the little spinning flag things that create vibrations and electronic devices.  Of course, those didn't work.  We have never tried chemical options because of our dogs.  The only time our current dogs are loose in the yard is when we are with them, so the Sweeney's Deadset trap is okay.  (the dogs don't stray far from our sides)  There is NO WAY I would have used this setup with the dogs we had in the past.  It would be extremely easy for a dog or child to get injured (quite severely) if their curiosity took over for even a minute.  Anyhow, setup was not just an easy 2 step procedure.  You want to make sure to read the instructions thoroughly.  There is prep work that goes into placing the ""trap"" successfully.  If you don't mind trial and sometimes error during the initial setup work, then I highly recommend this trap.  You also can't be too squeamish when emptying the trap.  I won't empty it solely for that reason.  I may not be a good daughter because of this, but I tell my mom it's her yard when it's time to empty the trap.",1379289600,2013-09-16
3.0,"My hopes with this product was to attract insect eating birds that do not usually visit our feeders.The problem is tray. The water holding portion is so narrow, covered by the bottle itself, that the larger birds don't even attempt it. :( This could've been easily resolved with a base of a greater diameter. Larger birds will choose a bird bath, everytime. I liked this concept as a cleaner water option that required less attention than a bird bath which dirties easily.I like that the bottle itself is small, requiring it to be filled more frequently. This helps insure it is refilled with fresh water and not growing green slime. Which, I also put a dash of apple cider vinegar in the waterers to help keep things from getting funky. The smaller bottle also isn't too heavy when filled. It's still plenty easy to lift to a feeding station. A note, you will need a narrow hook to fit the loop, it does not come with one for hanging nor did it fit on my station's hook.Overall, this hasn't been what I had hoped. No new insect eating birds attracted. It does offer a clean water station for small birds, like finches and sparrows though.

I'm not, however, so naive to think it will always be like this. While the feeder is attractive, I can already see that squirrels will probably solve this temporary puzzle. Perhaps a better name for this might have been Perky-Pet Squirrel Deterrent (At least for a while) Wild Bird Feeder.",1362787200,2013-03-09
2.0,"This doesn't come in it's own box and it wasn't packed well.  The clear guard was split in half and the perch base mangled.  The base is very thin metal, so I wasn't surprised, luckily I was able to bend it back into shape with my hands.  The means of squirrel deterrence is the base being spring-loaded so the weight of the squirrel pulls the neck over the feeding holes.  This is hindered by the thin base getting bent out of shape and by smarter squirrels simply holding on to the midsection and feeding upside-down (they could reach around the clear guard after I glued it back together).For this method of squirrel proofing, I prefer the feeders that have the entire exterior spring-loaded, so that no matter where the squirrel grabs on, the hatches close.  The same company even makes that style and sells it for cheaper.",1377993600,2013-09-01

4.0,"I love pressure cookers and have used them in cooking for about 40 years; I also formerly demonstrated several different brands in department and specialty cookware shops, so I was very eager to give the Emson pressure smoker a trial run.  In the hot smoke function, which cooks and smokes food at the same time - probably the most-used function - simply put a few smoking chips into a cup, cover the cup, pour in 1/2 cup water, layer the seasoned food onto the stacking racks, seal the cooker, set the time, and press ""Start.""  It really is that simple.  So far, I've cooked pork tenderloin, chicken drumsticks, and, using the cold smoke function, a salmon fillet. To my knowledge, this is the only stovetop appliance that will cold smoke food.  All the results were perfectly satisfactory.  This could be fun, so my next projects will be smoked hardboiled eggs, and smoked cheese.Details:  I didn't have any chips, so I've used the finely chopped wood chips I purchased for a Cameron stovetop smoker.  These worked fine, using about 1 tablespoon each time.  I followed the suggested times in the instruction booklet, except for the salmon.  I wanted smoked, lightly cooked salmon to place on a salad platter, and the instructed time would have produced a flakey fish suitable for mixing into pates.Reality checks:  While the pressure smoker does smoke food much faster than traditional outdoor smoking, the process is not nearly as fast as pressure cooking in a traditional pressure cooker.  The Emson instructions say to cook chicken pieces for 30 minutes, which produced a slightly overcooked, but tasty dinner.  A traditional pressure cooker takes ten minutes to cook chicken parts.  It may be possible to match the faster results by a traditional cooking method in the Emson smoker, omitting the chips, but the residual smoke odor would discourage me from cooking any recipe other than smoked food.More reality:  The capacity of the cooker is limited to approximately the amount of food for three or four people even with the layering of the racks.  But, the process is quick, so one could repeat the process for a bigger crowd.  The smoke odor fills the room; it remained for over a day, even though I am able to leave a door open to outside and ran the kitchen exhaust fan directly above the cooker while I was using it.  I washed the cooker and am storing it in the garage, but I still smell the smoke when I pass it, several days later.  The safety instructions do not spell out clearly enough the risk of burning oneself.  The user must pull off the pressure regulator to release the steam.  This sends steam shooting out.  I tried it first with a thick hot pad to protect my hand and quickly pulled back as the pad became saturated with steam.  I used a silicone mitt to remove the regulator with good results.  I still came away with my hair and clothes smelling like smoke.All in all, it's a well-made product that delivers as promised.",1320192000,2011-11-02

It is essentially a zinc pistol grip nozzle with a full-action setting, plus several selectable patterns.MAINTENANCE> Avoid leaving the nozzle in damp acidic soil or puddles.  Even brass can corrode eventually.  Always shut the nozzle completely off when you are finished using it---even if you close your faucet as well because even very slow leakage can leave mineral deposits in the nozzle, or acidic water can corrode the nozzle.> With time and/or a little corrosion, the action can get stiff.  Unscrew the nozzle as far as it will go (to the full-open, maximum flow position).  Smear grease on the core (inside) peice and open/close the nozzle several times to spread the grease around.  Wipe off excess.  Some brass nozzles (the best, probably including the Dramm) designs are all brass and have no o-rings.  Some cheap, particularly plastic, versions have o-ring seals.  Petroleum grease can damage o-rings, and anything else made from rubber.  Silicon grease is better, especially for nozzles with o-rings.Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.> If the nozzle leaks, try greasing it as described above.> If your water has a high calcium content (you'll know because it makes a white film on your bathroom tiles and your showerhead), it is possible that limestone deposits have built up inside your nozzle.  If greasing doesn't fix the problem, open the nozzle fully and soak it in vinegar overnight.  (This is the same fix for your showerhead and for your bathroom and kitchen faucetheads if they no longer spray evenly).CHOOSING A BRASS NOZZLECarefully examine the nozzle before purchasing.  It should consists of 2 and ONLY 2 brass parts.  If the hose connector is ""pressed-on"" to the core piece, don't buy it.  Such nozzle can leak.  Purchase only SOLID brass nozzles.A NOZZLE NOT A VALVEAlthough it does have a ""closed"" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offjust before the nozzle---this is also a good solution if you purchase a cheap nozzle which leaks.",1336521600,2012-05-09

5.0,"After months of battling a pesky mouse situation we actually NAMED our lil wild friend after he dashed across my foot one night during a trip to the bathroom...!! This trap succeeded in humanely capturing one Mr. Bo Jangles so he could be relocated to a nearby field!!After reading numerous reviews of various humane traps here on Amazon, I finally settled on this trap and the metal 12 catch mousetrapJ.T. EATON 421CL ""REPEATER"" MULTIPLE CATCH MOUSE TRAP.  I'll admit, once these traps arrived I was really impressed with the multi-catch trap which APPEARS to a very awesome trap and was VERY easy to bait! Mr. Bo Jangles never ventured anywhere near the multi-catch trap,, perhaps the strong stench of machine oil present... thankfully the Havahart trap did not have the offensive odor.  Additionally I had to modify the Multi-catch trap as it would have easily released any entrapped mouse with a simple nose press on the upper lid...The Havaheart trap looked weak and appeared difficult to set, I seriously had doubts initially.  I admit I played with the trap awhile and made a number of minor adjustments to the trap before baiting it with a piece of Granola Bar which I ""glued"" to the bait table with a nice chunk of peanut butter.  Once baited, I found a quiet closet in which Bo Jangles had previously been spotted and set it in the middle of the closet floor. AFTER setting the trap in place and being sure this was ""the place"" did I attempt to actually set the previously baited trap.I gave this Havahart trap a 5 star rating despite the written instructions being less than ideal since it caught our lil friend in less than a week.  Just play with the trap awhile and understand how it works before relying on it to catch your mice.  Also understand that it may need a few minor adjustments due to being bounced around in shipping.I wish to thank the Reviewer who provided sane advice for a wise method for releasing the trapped mouse.  As a reminder, when releasing the mouse open the door that is AWAY from you!!  In our case, I took the trap to a local field along with a reliable stick.  I set the trap in the field and used the stick to gently remove the door lock of the door AWAY from me thereby allowing the mouse to nose his way through door.  Using the stick I had to gently move the trap over on the side to allow the mouse an easier time of releasing itself from the trap but at least I didn't have a mouse running up my coat sleeve!! ;-)",1265241600,2010-02-04

5.0,"A family of raccoons had taken up residence in a sheltered area of my house.  They demolished a make-shift barricade I previously erected at the entrance.  I could hear them scratching and squirming in the little den of theirs, which used to be part of my house.  I tried a ""coyote urine"" repellent  - without success.  I decided to give this Contech ScareCrow a try.  I erected it in front of the den entrance and turned it on just before midnight, when I was sure all the raccoons had left their den.  An hour later, it fired and I heard the sound of animal running away.  All was quiet afterwards.  The next day, I spent all day erecting another barricade - a much sturdier one this time, with grade A "" lumber, 1/4"" steel screws, and "" steel nuts and bolts.  I left the ScareCrow where it was, just for good measure.  During the week, the Scarecrow fired a couple of times during the night and that was it.  The raccoons never returned to attack the barricade again.The nature of and solution to animal problems vary extensively, but for the narrow purpose of keeping raccoons from getting into their den, this Contech ScareCrow passed with flying colors.  The whole unit is made of plastic; it may not last very long under the hot desert sun of the American Southwest, but it did work as it was supposed to right out of the box and setting it up was a breeze.

2.0,"Upon receipt, I wasn't particularly thrilled with the cheap plastic tray.  I never expected it to be such a flimsy product, especially since I'm big on using Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it's not going to last too long.  The clips from the chain were pretty difficult to snap on, I didn't think the plastic would survive the snap, but all 3 did.I waited until the Orioles showed up and immediately put this feeder out.  That was 2 weeks ago.  I filled the container half way, to test the waters, and hung the feeder from a shady tree.  I have plenty of birds in my yard; woodpeckers, cardinals, titmouse, nuthatches, chickadees, sparrows, robins, orioles, hummingbirds, starlings, goldfinches, mockingbirds, on a daily basis.  I have a suet feeder on a pole, that I now fill with seed cakes, that is the current favorite by all above mentioned birds.  For 2 weeks, I sporadically checked this feeder.  I had never seen one bird visit.  I had noticed the jelly dropping from the 3 drain holes in the orange plastic tray.  The ants were thankful for that.  I went out on the deck last night and heard unusual noise; sure enough, the local gimpy raccoon (has a bum leg) was tossing & turning the feeder.  I didn't even bother to shoo it away or spray it with the hose.  I figured I'd let him enjoy it.  He licked it clean, and for that, I'm kind of grateful.

4.0,"I got the chance to try out the TeiKis BBQ grill mat and metal skewers this weekend, and they worked out better than I expected. Keeping in mind that I'm not a BBQ expert (and I've never tried to grill veggies before), the results were pretty good.The sheets are a thin Teflon-based (PTFE-coated) pad that you toss on the BBQ to heat/roast/cook whatever you have in mind. I used it for veggies I had marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have to make sure the pad is not exposed to open flame, nor used in temps over 500 degrees. When I got done with the grilling (complete with sizzling marinade), the veggies were nicely singed and soft. It's a little hard to work with the sheet right off the grill, as there's no real structure or stiffness to it. I had to scoop most of the veggies off with a spatula before I could grab the corners and pour the rest of the marinade into the bowl. Washing was a little strange (hand-washing), as it was hard to scrub it down to make it feel completely clean. On the next pass, I'll probably run it through the dishwasher.The skewers were a bit more iffy for me. It was better for larger chunks, as the &#34;sharp end&#34; is more blunt than the typical wooden skewers. I liked how you can shape the skewer around the grill based on the flexibility of the wire. I had to be careful when moving them around, as they *do* conduct heat better than wood. I also had to remove the food from the skewer before serving, as a looping wire doesn't quite have the same visual pizazz as individual wooden skewers.I'll definitely be adding more grilled veggies into my routine by using the TeiKis mats. I'm not sure how much I'll use the skewers, but I still like the idea of having them around if needed.Disclosure:Obtained From: RetailerPayment: Free",1402358400,2014-06-10

1.0,"As a veterinarian, I would advise against purchasing this product.  The metal pan base appears to be galvanized, which means it is coated with a layer of zinc to prevent rusting.  If so, that zinc will leach into the water and is toxic to birds.  I returned mine for this reason. Feeders containing copper should also be avoided, since copper toxicity is also problem for birds.  Also avoid hummingbird food containing red dye, which is associated with birth defects.  (Instead just use a 1:4 mixture of sugar to unsoftened water; which is the same thing, without the harmful dye).  Since you probably don't intend to harm the birds you are trying to help, I would advise choosing different products.  If you have already purchased these products, I would advise returning them or just throwing them away.  You won't see the dead hummingbirds, new ones will keep coming to the feeder, but you may be killing them off without realizing it. Even if they put a clear coating over the metal, it wouldn't last long enough to prevent the hazard.

I used a 1/16"" drill bit and put three holes in the bottom of each tray - now it drains fine.The third flaw, which I haven't found a good solution for, is this. Depending on how you mount it, the feeder can be easily unbalanced, causing seed or water spills. I can't take credit for figuring this one out - the squirrels that live in my yard found out that by sitting near one edge of the feeder, it tips onto its side and most of the contents spill out.It's an attractive product I suppose, but seems to require some TLC to get the best out of it.",1306540800,2011-05-28

2.0,"I purchased one of these around 2 years ago at local HW place,  to find out Gilmour had moved to China. Gilmour used to be very good quality, but not anymore. Apparently most everyone has gone to China and the quality of these valves has really gone downhill, but not the price they charge you. This valve is really cheap and can't take much pressure and it got  a pin hole leak in the valve after about 2 years and I foolishly  replaced it with another one, to have it blow it out six months later as it was the only Y valve the HW had and I needed another one ASAP. I use quite a few Y valves/hose splitters  and 4 way splitters, so the 'search' was on to find something better.Here is how I rate the valves now after ordering them and studying them and using them.BEST1. Camco-Y  ball Valve/ hose spliter. Made in the USA, solid , solid brass with amazing full sized ball valves. High flow. Designed to also fit RV. Commercial grade valve! Hands down winner and same price as the Gilmour and made in the USA. Available on Amazon. This is superb valve.2. Achla Designs. Made in Taiwan but very solid and heavy. For commercial use. Available on Amazon. This is a great valve.3. Orbit Y ball Valve /splitter - Much thicker than Gilmour valve. And much cheaper. Made in China. Available on Amazon. This is a pretty good valve.4. Nelson Y ball valve/splitter-Nelson went to China not to long ago. Current valves are very lightweight and not suitable for commercial use. Orbit splitters are heavier and better made. Available on Amazon. This is acceptable if you turn the Hose bibb off and have lower pressure water lines.5 Melnor, more cheap made in China stuff, quality is not as good as Nelson made in China stuff largely as Nelson is has better finish quality. Available on Amazon. This is similar to the Nelson.6. Ray Padula- More made in China that is suitable for gardening but not commercial use. All of Rays Products are made in China and are very expensive. He's kind of what is wrong with the USA, marketing hype and advertising then off-shoring to sweat shops and delivering poor quality and hoping you're 'dumb' as he rolls in the money . Ray should have gone to college to learn mechanical engineer and manufacturing and learned what it means to be an American manufacturer. Give a 'lifetime' guarantee to try and convince you its worth the time to drive and pick up a new valve. His prices indicate he expects 2.5 valves to fail in your lifetime. Buy Camco and pay once and less and get made in the USA!!! Let Ray move to China, the Chinese want made in the USA for their own gardens.WORST---------------------------------------I wish someone with an engineering background or industrial background would write these reviews, but the made in China crowd would not make as much money replacing their blown out valves.I don't know why DRAMM does not make a Y valve or Hose splitter or if they do, why Amazon does not carry it.  Amazon carries some of their high quality nozzles and hose disconnects that are made in the USA and high quality.  DRAMM is the best when it comes to brass. Camco is the next best quality you're going to find.Stay away from that Made in China stuff, we send them fake money, with Pictures of dead Presidents and they send us fake valves that break down. Made in Taiwan quality is pretty good if you cant find American or Canadians products.",1333411200,2012-04-03

The second one works as advertized; it cuts items smaller than 1/4 inch without difficulty.  The only reason that I did not raise my rating to 5 stars is due to product design rather than performance.  It would be worthy of 5 stars if it could be shortened; much as the pole chain saw can be used in either two or three sections.",1332288000,2012-03-21
1.0,I have a small soft tub hot tub.  Our water is very soft and it is basically just my husband and I who use the hot tub.This bottle says best when used within 6 months.  (I've had my current bottle of anti foam 4 months and I've not used 1/4 of it yet -- shelf life is not mentioned on my current brand).The smell in the bottle is not overly bad but I suspect based on other reviews that it reacts with different chemicals that are currently in the water.  My bottom line is stick with a single line of chemicals that are built to react to each other.This one seems to not react well with many other chemical systems.,1403740800,2014-06-26

4.0,"Summary:  A small, compact pressure washer that is fine for occasional use.  Two heads allow either a rapid spinning needle spray, or a variable wide to needle pattern.Pros:  Compact, easy to use, good quality.  The handle is comfortable, and the pressure is perfect for the casual exterior cleaning I do.  If I need to do a deep cleaning, I'd rent a 3,000+ pound sprayer, as this is not designed for hard to clean jobs.  The power cord is long (25 feet, I think) and the hose is about 10 feet long.  So it reaches around the house from the power outlets fairly well.Cons: The hook-up for the water is plastic.  This can be changed out for Brass, which I did.I'd buy it again.  After three months of use, I remain pleased with the purchase.  The one star deduction is for the cheap plastic ready-connect.",1371600000,2013-06-19
3.0,"By the time you see the annoying little buggers, it is too late. You must throw out any contaminated or potentially tainted foodstuffs, seal any entry points and scrub everything down. This product can help. It is easy to set up and contains a lure that is designed to attract and trap male moths. There is no discernible odor and it is non-toxic. However, I have had mixed luck with it. I used it in a shed where I store bird seed and dog and cat food. One bag of seed turned out to be buggy. So far this has captured two moths. I was hoping for more impressive results. A piece of fly paper was far more effective and I think removing the lure and affixing it to the fly paper might help.It is a conundrum. I learned from a manager of a  retailer that they spray their bags of pet food and bird seed  with insecticide. It may be effective but it is not acceptable. So I guess the only option is the occasional headache of pantry pest elimination. Again, this product seems to be somewhat helpful and therefore could serve as part of a removal strategy.",1369699200,2013-05-28

1.0,"The way they are pictured, it seems simple to just place them individually and light them. In fact, they come in one 6-cube by 4-cube mass of cubes. Each cube is attached to at least three other cubes by the plastic cut that surrounds each cube. Also, each cube has a aluminum foil on top of it to seal the flammable material in the plastic cup.The first challenge is how to separate them. They do not just pull apart. I cut mine with a scissors, which resulted in small pieces of the flammable material all over my counter. Then I wondered, do I remove the foil? Is the plastic cup flammable? There are no answers to these questions on the packaging.That precedes the question of how to ignite the cubes once charcoal has been stacked on top of them. There are three answers to that question, a long fireplace match, a propane torch or charcoal lighter fluid.  My choice was the latter and viola, instant flames, and assumed Weber lighter cube ignition.What seems simple when reading the sales literature is in fact, not simple at all. And if you are using a chimney starter to light your charcoal, the problem will be magnified, although you could probably put charcoal in the chimney, hold it over your head to be able to see the cubes and ignite them with a butane lighter. (I would not recommend using this procedure if you would need to use lighter fluid to ignite the Weber cubes - unless there is a shower nearby with plenty of soap and water available.)",1379894400,2013-09-23

When we get a blizzard coming, we'll fasten the bottoms and I have no doubt it will stay in place just fine.Side note:  This cover is hheeaavvvy!  Let husband take it on and off the grill.

4.0,This is a very well made device and it looks like it would work very well for mice. I didn't realize it was just for mice though I assumed multi kill meant multi as in different rodents not quantity of just mice. So know that this will only kill mice NOT RATS. We don't have mice here so I was unable to tell if it works or not but it is sturdy well made and very easy to bait. It has a very tiny chamber the mouse must go through so a rat will not fit. Too bad they didn't make this with a larger chamber for both rats and mice.,1310342400,2011-07-11
4.0,"I bought these shortly after buying Black & Decker's cordless electric lawn mower (which I also love), and I wasn't disappointed.The trimmer/hedge trimmer/blower work as you'd expect, the trimmer even features a telescoping body to adjust comfortably to your height. They are also relatively quiet and require no gasoline can or earplugs!The best part is that you get all three units for the price of just two of them sold separately! Plus, an unexpected but very welcome bonus is that this set comes with its own plastic mount for all three tools AND a separate mount for the batteries. I wouldn't have considered this a big selling point, had I read it, but having the ability to easily hang the tools in my garage out of the way and out of the reach of my kids is more valuable than I expected.Bravo Black & Decker!-1 star, however, because my package came with only two batteries (though to B&D;'s credit, they sent the third with minimal fuss once I contacted customer support).Oh, and once you buy these suckers, beware! Black & Decker have a whole product line of cordless drills, saws, sanders and other power tools that run on the 18-volt battery system, and once they pull you into the product line, all the other 18-volt products become pretty enticing!",1210204800,2008-05-08

Moist-growing media containing high amounts of peat moss are particularly attractive to adult females.I have 2, 50 pellet pot jiffy seedling starters. I ordered these for refills because it was more fpr a cheaper price. Now I know why..You can tell these were at least last years old stock or older. You can tell that simply by how long it takes the pellets to absorb the water. It should really only take 1 minute to absorb. These took over 3 to 5 minutes. Most of the seeds I planted when using this batch of pellets did not grow. I was going to try to save the peat to mix with some potting soil.When I opened the pellets there were tons of Fungus Gnat Larvae feeding on the seeds inside.

4.0,"I have a hard clay yard, many areas of it the lawn is growing well but there are a few patches where grass just won't grow. If you look at the ground it's just solid dirt, compacted so much that grass won't grow, in many cases water doesn't even seep into it. I had the chance to try this aerator out and at first I wasn't sure. It didn't have hollow teeth like others I had seen but it still works well. What I found is I wet the area a little bit and then started to poke this in the ground, step on it to push it in then pulled it out. Repeated about a hundred times as I walked around and that seems to have loosened the soil up. It's too early to tell if grass will grow, but there is better airflow and now at least water is draining better and going into the ground. I have planted grass seed as well so only time will tell.I did not have any issues with this bending or feeling like it would bend in my hard clay soil.

1.0,"I have had this set out for about two weeks.  It hasn't caught one rat or mouse!  However, the first night I had it out, something did try to eat the bait (dog food).  When I got up the next morning, I discovered the Rat Zapper turned upside down, with the battery cover dislodged and the batteries (and bait) strewn a couple feet from the trap.  Apparently, it has enough of a zap to royally tick off whatever critter wanted the bait, but not enough to kill it.I put the batteries back in and re-baited (and reset) the trap.  Two days later, the kill light was flashing, and I eagerly looked inside.  The trap was empty.  Not only was there no critter in the trap, but the bait was gone.I gave it one more try.  Put more dog food (and peanut butter smeared in a soda pop top -- you can't put wet bait directly on the bait tray), and then I reset the trap.  It has been almost two weeks, and except for the bait, it sits empty.  I guess the critters learned their lesson, and they've decided to leave the trap alone, but still infest my property.I can't recommend a trap that merely annoys its intended victim, but doesn't kill it.",1373673600,2013-07-13

It's very calming to watch them even though their wings beat at a furious rate.Filling it is easy: Just unscrew the jar and fill it up, then screw it back in. The only issue I have personally when setting it back on the post is that some of the nectar spills out because I have to flip it around to hang it.

4.0,"First I bought the McCulloch MCS2001 14 amp Electric Chipper/Shredder.  It worked ok on sticks and twigs, but feeding leaves in was a time consuming chore.  We wanted something where you could scoop up a big handful of leaves and just drop them into the mulcher.  The Worx model does that.  Essentially it is a weed-eater and uses the same plastic line to cut up the leaves.We use the Toro 29210 43-Gallon Gardening Spring Bucket (also purchased on Amazon) to catch the leaves.  We spread ours out for mulching, so we don't use a plastic bag for curbside disposal. As long as the leaves are dry, this unit works quite well.  The McCulloch unit was very heavy and hard to maneuver and store.  The Worx unit breaks down nicely for easy storage and is easy to move around.  I would buy the Worx again.String Option: We needed new mulcher string and I noticed the Worx uses .090 string.  You can buy specific Worx replacement string online for more than I prefer to pay.  Most trimmer string is smaller or larger so I purchased the .095 string and it fits, snugly, for about 1/3 of the price.  You have to cut it yourself, but that's not a problem.",1353369600,2012-11-20

This blower can move a reasonable amount of material to keep your sidewalk clean, but unlike a gas blower, the debris is not going to go flying yards away. The air speed drops off quickly after a few inches, this blower is good for close range lift and move operations.One surprise is indoor use: garage, basement, cobwebs, under the couch, etc. This blower is quiet enough and has speed controls that make it useful indoors.I have to mention the great battery, it charges fast, has built in charge tester, and last a long time.

4.0,"I replaced one of my unsightly plastic pots with this attractive hanging planter. It was very easy to attach the chain hooks to the edge of the basket and hang it on an existing hook. I planted it with a big pot of purple pansies. The 14-inch size allows you to use plenty of fresh soil to give the flowers room to grow, and will be slow to dry out, so probably will not need daily watering. The biodegradable pot and open design makes the basket lightweight, and does not appear to spill over and leak as easily as the plastic pot after watering. My concern is that the thin cardboard-like substance from which the liner is made will probably last only one season, and I didn't find on Amazon a source for replacement liners. It would be a shame if this hanging basket was good for only one year, as that sort of offsets the ecological benefit of using a biodegradable liner.",1367625600,2013-05-04

5.0,"I have a smallish backyard garden (five raised beds, each 4x12') and, for me, weeding is the least fun part of gardening. Over the past few years I've begun using black plastic sheeting as a mulch to cover the beds and I'm a complete convert: black plastic mulch heats the soil, retains moisture and, most importantly, it makes weeding a thing of the past, except... Except that when it comes to certain crops, like onions, it's really not efficient. It's simply too big a chore to cut slits for 200-300 baby onion plants and even if you do, weeds will grow up *right next* to the onion plant. Last year I had a horrific weeding problem in my onion bed (I devoted one 4x12' bed to just onions); some awful insidious grasses just took over and made weeding a torturous chore and kept the size of the yield to a bare minimum. Weeds robbed all of the nitrogen and other nutrients in the soil and really stunted the growth.I decided this year to try a pre-emergent weed killer, but being the organic sort of person I am, I certainly wasn't going to pump Preen or some other awful crap into my food beds. I'd been reading about the benefits of corn gluten meal (though there is considerable online debate about its effectiveness) and decided this was the year I would try it. What the heck; if it works, a miracle, if not, I'm not worse off than last year (and next year I'd have to figure out a way to use the plastic with onions). Then the Amazon Vine Program offered me, like a miracle, a bag of this corn gluten meal. Perfect timing. So last week I took what was a strawberry bed for the past few years, dug up all the strawberry plants, churned in 120 lbs of composted manure and let it sit for a few days. Then I added this corn gluten meal and raked it in and watered it gently per the instructions. Interestingly, I had read many times that timing is everything with corn gluten and that the best time to put it into the soil is just as the forsythia are budding--and that's just what I did (I'm in zone 6 in Connecticut). I'm letting the corn sit for a few days before I plant the onion plants. By the way, you can't use this product with seeds because obviously it will not allow them to ""emerge."" It is *only* useful with seedlings and the bag says it's perfectly safe for seedlings.Of course, I can't yet tell you if it works or not because it's not warm enough for the weeds to really be kicking in. But I'm following the instructions carefully, have done everything I think is required and now I'm just waiting. (There are time constraints on Vine reviews otherwise I would have waited to post this.) But I *will* update this in about two weeks (early May) to see if it really is controlling weeds. I'm kind of excited to see if this works, because if it does, I may use it in other beds and stop buying as much plastic. I don't mind using the plastic, but again, for some crops, it's quite a pain. So, update coming soon. I hope this works!Update 4/27: OK, about a week, so far no signs of weeds. But I planted 200 onions today, so fingers crossed.Update 5/02: Kind of impressed. Still don't see a sign of a weed in that onion bed. Could this stuff possibly work?Update 5/14: This is pretty amazing--a few big rainy days, lots of hot days and not a week in sight!

I have read that some mice will avoid a trap with a human's smell. Take steps like gloves, trap cleaning and never touching the bait for that one educated mouse. Dead mouse smell on the trap can also be a turn off. So think clean. One way to keep mice out of your house is to locate exterior gaps or holes. Buy a roll of copper mesh, available on Amazon.

5.0,"When my review sample arrived I was a bit surprised by how large these actually are. That is a big plus for me because I am basically lazy and these allow me to make shorter work of lawn jobs.I do not get many leaves, but I am forever cutting back bushes and trimming palm fronds. Where these have proven to be perfect is I have an interesting population of snakes in my yard as do many Floridians. My visitors include a coral snake that is not aggressive, but one that I do not want to bite me when I am scooping up debris, fronds and shrub trimmings. And there is always a pygmy rattlesnake or two in the yard. These scoops put some distance between my hands and inquiring fangs, and I suspect that when my yard guests see this looming near them when I am scooping up stuff they quickly move somewhere else.Seriously, these are easy to use and can pick up surprisingly large amounts of debris. It's easy to clean with a hose, and the pair nestles for easy storage, In fact, there is a hanging loop incorporated into the design for maximum convenience.This ships with a thin fabric bag with a logo. It is not something that would work for long term storage, but it certainly handy for other, unrelated uses. But the scoops are the best yard tool that I have come across in a long time.

5.0,"This is a solidly built garden tool. From the spikes to the handle, it is one piece, so even in the toughest of soils, you don't have to worry about the spikes separating. The handle provides a solid grip that is covered in a plasticky/rubbery material that won't twist or turn, but stays in place while being used.We might as well live in two different towns, so different is the ground soil in our front and back yards. This aerator was easy to use in front yard, which is fairly plush and well hydrated. But, more importantly, it was just as easy to use in the dry, hard dirt/lawn of the back yard.We've used a rotary cultivator in the past, and you'd think that the rotary action would make it easier and more useful. You'd be wrong, as it actually required more work to make sure that we actually broke through the surface of the lawn. This spike aerator might require more time, but it's definitely worth it for a product that, in the long run, is easier to use.",1400544000,2014-05-20

5.0,"I'm not the world's best organized as far as remembering to water my plants, so this plant sitter is ideal. I have it ""sitting"" a plant that's perched up on a high credenza in my office that I have to get up on a stool to water--- hence it sometimes gets missed.

2.0,"Fiskars badly missed the target on this one.  Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4"" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version.",1367280000,2013-04-30

5.0,"I bought this because my Hitachi string trimmer is so good and I haven't been disappointed.  Previously I went to a battery operated string trimmer after I gave up on my gas unit after two paid service calls that fixed it so it would start for 3 weeks.  When the batteries died after two years I tried the Hitachi based upon reviews and the 7 year warranty.Like the trimmer, the blower starts every time, the second pull out of the box, first time each time since.  The air velocity is notably better and stronger than the neighbor's brand X and it's of course much more convenient than my previous corded electric version.  It easily moves leaves, grass clippings, and wood chips and slivers from chain sawing two large trees.Although there are only three pieces to assemble, assembly was difficult.  The end piece on the two piece nozzle is a tight fit and the nozzle to the motor housing is an equally tight fit.  It was a two person job and still difficult.  I would not want to have to disassemble and reassemble it for every use.5 stars because it's powerful and starts easily every time.Added after a year of use.  Still strong and always starts.  If you're right handed, you have to hold it away from your body  or you'll block the air inlet.  If you're blowing a yard full of leaves, that can get tiresome.  Holding it in your left hand isn't a problem, the exhaust is aimed forward.  There's no strap or place to hook one, so you can't hang it over your shoulder.  Just observations, still very happy with this.",1304553600,2011-05-05

4.0,"I normally don't title my reviews with the name of the product I bought, but I felt the need to with this one because there are several different types (floating, submersible...wattage, you get the idea).I think this is an adorable little birdbath fountain! Very inexpensive and has been working well for about  three weeks. We thoroughly enjoy watching it. When the sun is out. It is extremely sensitive to lack of sunshine ~ even on days where there are a few clouds in the sky ~ if the sun goes away, so does the fountain! I love that it came with several different fountain sprays. My favorite, is actually the shorter, standard type fountain fixture.I've not had trouble with the water being expelled from the bird bath as others have. Even when using the taller fountain fixtures. I love that it keeps the birdbath water circulating ~ keeps it cleaner for a lot longer! Mosquitoes aren't quite here yet, but this should help keep them at bay.This particular pump has little rubber suctions cups that should stick to a bird bath that is GLAZED (maybe painted). My birdbath is concrete and it doesn't stick (I didn't expect it to). However, it sits nicely right in the center and doesn't move. The birdbath needs to be kept filled up so that the pump is submerged at all times or you'll risk burning it out.You need to keep that solar panel up high, facing as much of the sun as possible. I'm fortunate enough to have a 6' PVC fence and perch that panel up leaning on one of the fence post caps and it's perfect! The birds were a bit afraid of it at first, but not they really love it and I actually get birds bathing instead of just drinking, which is a treat for us:)For the price, I think anyone would enjoy this cute little fountain; just don't expect it to work well, or at all, without sunshine!",1400716800,2014-05-22
5.0,I bought this last year and used it on one house of mine in the late Fall.  Went up on the roof with a sprayer and sprayed the roof.  By this Spring the mold was all gone.  Between the snow and rain it worked gently and cleaned the roof.  What went down the gutters did no damage to my lawn or rain barrel water.  I just bought this container for a second home with the same issue.  I sprayed it on it last month so we'll see what Spring brings but I am sure it will work.  This second home does not have gutters so this will wash onto some brick steps with the same mold problem.  I am hoping it cleans those also.,1388102400,2013-12-27

2.0,"Overall I feel as though this product is weak. It is easy to snap together, but very difficult to pull apart. I messed around with them for some time, thinking there must be a knack to it, but I just couldn't figure it out. I had to pull it really hard to make it snap back open again and I feel as though this would damage a plant stem. Also, the space left for the stem once snapped together was rather large--I imagine an Asiatic lily stem fitting in it snuggly, but the pepper plants that I grow ever year would probably have too thin of a stem to fit securely.The best thing about this product is that it is green and is made in a leaf design so as not to draw attention to it. Otherwise though, I think I'd rather stick with using twine.",1385164800,2013-11-23

5.0,"I've gone through the usually assortment of 2 stroke gas trimmer and now battery trimmers.  This Black and Decker replaces my old Black and Decker 18v cordless trimmer.  That trimmer was still working fine after seven years of use, but I was offered this one and decided to give it a shot.Wow, what a difference!  The build quality has gone up quite a bit, and remember, my old one was going strong at seven years on the original batteries.  This one has far better balance and grips, and far more power than 2 additional watts would suggest.  Previously when switching into edger mode, I'd have to make 2-3 passes to cleanly edge my lawn.  This unit took one pass to do a job that looked as good as a corded edger.My lawn isn't that big so I haven't used the &#34;Runtime Extension&#34; feature.  The automatic feed spool works as well as my old model, so no stopping to feed out more trimmer string.  I also really like that it comes with two batteries.  One is all I need for the trimmer, but I usually get the blower and edger (I have all three in 18v) and I've found the leaf blowers can go through 2 batteries easily, so I can put this extra to good use.Overall I have to give it five stars.  Between my B&D; 18v trimmer, blower, and edger and my 36v cordless mower, I've never had any problems and all my batteries still work.  Whatever they are doing, they are doing it well.  And this model just feels like it's built better than it's very reliable predecessors.

5.0,"No gas ignition and that's all right by me.How many realize this without reviewing in detail the difference between this Performer and the one selling for $50 more? So, if it wasn't obvious to you before when you happened to look at this model please allow me to point that out. And, that's the only difference - all other parts and functions are the same.I bought this latest model as a gift for a friend.  I own this model's immediate predecessor that does not have the LCD timer.  And, this is my second Weber Performer; the first was the original, all metal model, which I finally decided to replace after many years of service and countless grillings.Why not opt for the gas ignition? I've been using a chimney charcoal starter for many years since the gas ignition feature on my original Performer wore out and decided to just save $50 with this one.The 22.5"" Weber Kettle is the best charcoal grill for the money available today. It's simple to use and very versatile. It's big enough to have different cooking zones. Charcoal uses radiant heat to cook and direct grilling allows for extremely high heat to sear steaks and burgers. The grill's style also allows you to cook with indirect heat for chicken, ribs and other foods needing lower heat and longer time to cook just right. Of course, charcoal gives all your food a superior taste over a gas grill.The Performer just makes the Kettle so much better with a work table surface area, integrated tilt out charcoal storage bin, large storage rack beneath and it rolls / moves easier than a standard Kettle.Some useful tips if you buy the Performer:* Buy a Weber rotisserie insert for this grill. Absolutely fantastic accessory for making incredibly delicious, moist chicken, turkey, etc.* For grilling, I switched to the cast iron insert by Craycourt a couple years ago. Wonderful! They are relatively expensive, but once you've tried them you'll wonder why you didn't switch earlier.* There are so many great places to learn using your Weber.  One of the best is The Virtual Weber Bulletin Board and its forum (w w w . tvwbb . c o m)  People there cook just about everything over these kettles and it's amazing!  Lots of fun.",1383091200,2013-10-30

5.0,"I detest rodents and cannot tolerate them.  I also hate killing things and want as little to do with it as possible, and do not want animals, even rodents, to suffer painful, lingering deaths.  Given all that, the Rat Zapper is my rodent protection.The Rat Zapper electrocutes rodents - a humane death.  It is effective.  I use it in my basement and garage and where it has killed many mice.  It is also good for the squeamish, that's me.  If I can't get my brave husband to empty it, I can grit my teeth and dump the contents into a garbage bag for disposal. I cannot imagine using snap or glue traps.I bait the Rat Zapper with a bit of peanut butter topped with a couple chocolate chips placed on a small square of cardboard.  To insert the bait, I wear disposable gloves and push the cardboard to the back of the device using a wooden paint stirrer.  Didn't I say that I'm squeamish?I have rats in my yard, outside.  Sometimes the seeds fallen from the bird feeders attract them.  They, too, must die.  Generally I rely on bait boxes which I fill with poisonous bait.  When I saw a rat peacefully grazing under the bird feeder that was way beyond tolerable.  I placed the Rat Zapper in the garden protected by a Trug seeTierra-Derco 50-0030R 30-Liter 8-Gallon Trug, Red.  After the first night, the bait was gone, but no dead rat.  The second morning, the Rat Zapper had been emptied and completely flipped over in the Trug, with no dead rat!  I know that rats are smart, but this just wasn't working.  I rebaited the boxes and, sure enough, found a dead rat within a couple days.There are methods of dealing with the intelligence of rats, like allowing them to take the bait for a few days with the Rat Zapper turned off.  After they are used to eating the bait, you power the Rat Zapper and should find a dead rat.  I just wasn't willing to play rat games, so resorted to the bait boxes and bait.For rodents, primarily mice, inside the house and garage, I wouldn't be without a Rat Zapper.  When I see the flashing red light, nine times out of ten it signals a dead mouse.  I feed comforted knowing that the food on my pantry is safe from rodent contamination.",1375920000,2013-08-08

In fact, I buy them by the case.  I was interested in trying a new one.Being new is the only thing the Nooski mouse trap has going for it.  It's miserable to set, not terribly effective, and when it works it's inhumane.  First you have to set the trap.  This involves rolling a very tight rubber ring around the trap.  That's a pain and I ended up needing my son's help.  We tried tripping the trap and it tripped one time out of three attempts.  We placed the trap in a high mouse traffic zone.  It was located by plain old sticky boards.  The first two nights all the sticky boards had a mouse but not the nooski.  The third night, the nooski caught a mouse.  Kind of.  It actually ended up not around his neck but kind of around his head.  He made it a good distance.  We only found him because of the bright green ring.  I really hate mice and I will kill them to keep them out of my grain, chicken coops, and especially house.  But there is no way I can justify doing that to an animal.

None on the box and none in the directions. I also tried to find the manufacturer on the internet and no luck there either.If the hose goes bad, you are simply out of luck. Another concern is that this hose is not to be used for drinking water.

Total cost: just over $18.

5.0,"This is a good all around gardening potting mix.  I find it never had a lot of sticks in it- though like other potting soils it always seems to be better to buy in the spring than later in the year towards the fall.  Later bags tend to have bigger 'chunks' in them for some reason.I like it enough to buy about a bag a week.  In early spring I can often find better prices than this in the big box stores, but not always.  The least I've seen it for is $7 on sale, but it often runs around 10-12 for 2 cubic feet, so I might as well buy it on Amazon and have it delivered and save the gas.  It's really a LOT easier on my back this way.It has a lot of peat in it which absorbs water keeping the mix damp longer.  When starting seeds, it is just very important to get the seed tray good and wet the first time after you start them, but then monitor them closely and don't over water - if you do the seeds can just rot instead of sprouting, but that first good watering is needed to soften up the seed shells.Sometimes if I have another mix, I will use it on the bottom and then this on TOP of my pots.  That still helps keep water in.I've started tons of seeds in this in my greenhouse- they don't have a hard time at all pushing up through it because it's a finer mix than some, and it helps give seedlings the moisture they need so they don't dry out until they get some size and their second leaves.I've not had any problems with weeds coming up in it or anything either, like I have some cheaper brands.  Only stuff that comes up is what I plant.The bags are a pretty thick plastic too, and I've never had one arrive busted.  Amazon has been putting mine in cardboard to ship too though, so they've been arriving nice and secure.

4.0,"Lets start with the seed pods the kit comes with - it comes with 18 pods that make up 13 different vegetables and herbs.

I am planting mine late in the season, so I'm not sure how many will do well as the big heat of Summer has already passed.The pods are larger than traditional seed starting pods that you can plant yourself, but they also contain plant food at the bottom, and normally you add that afterward, so that part is pretty neat.They are REALLY easy to plant too- pull off the paper seal on the top that says what it is, and gently put it in your prepared dirt... water... and wallah!  Your plant start is on the way!So, lets talk what is included - there are 2 different tomato plants - assuming they do well, you'll get a lot of tomatoes from the plants - so they are a good choice.  The Cucumber, Bush Bean, Snap Pea and Sweet Peppers should also all provide multiple veggies per plant, which is great.  In my experience (I don't have the greenest thumb in the world, but can generally hold my own), here in Washington, I tend to have trouble with the leafy veggies (spinach, lettuce - of which this kit has 6) - the slugs come enjoy them before we can - so  little tip a relative gave me - wash some egg shells, crush them and mix them in with the dirt.  The slugs don't like the scratch on their bellies, and will turn around and leave.  Then we have the herbs - 2 each of basil, cilantro and dill - in my experience, with a smallish garden, this is a great number of plants - I normally do 1 basil, 1 cilantro and 3 dill (for pickles).The kit also includes some fun recipes, and it seems like the vegetable/herb mix is great for Washington State as everything grows really well here.I would say that this kit really is great if you want to grow your plants from seeds (which cuts down the expense of planting a garden, and is fun to watch grow), if you have limited space and still want a fun variety, or if you are planting a garden with kids.  If you are aiming to mass-produce veggies and herbs in your garden, don't get this kit - you are ahead of this one and can do the starts yourself with the small peat discs and a covered holder.",1377648000,2013-08-28

We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals. This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer ""trimmed"" all our shrubs, even the ones right next to the house.

4.0,"UPDATE:  I sprayed another round of Deer-Off on my chestnut tree trunks & the deer have avoided my trees (no fresh bark rubbed off of the trunks).  However, the Deer Off does not deter my squirrels, and, without hesitation, they scamper up the tree trunks to get the chestnuts._________________________________________________________________________So Far, So Good because it isn't prime rut season and, to me, this is the full test of a product because that is when the deer really tear up my 5-7 year old chestnut trees.  Squirrels & Rabbits are not an issue until the nuts fall in September (squirrels), so I cannot comment on how the spray is a deterrent for these animals.We have a regular deer herd that hangs out on our property (about 5-6 deer).  They have been hard on my chestnut trees and, while, I want to be kind to nature, I really don't want them eating my trees or rubbing on the tree trunks.Since it is late May, the deer have been fairly quiet, and, prior to the Deer Off, ate a few leaves (especially on a newly planted chestnut - munched the top right off of it).  I have not noticed any further activity, and have noticed that the deer seem to choose to stay over in neighboring properties rather than in our yard.  However, rut will really put Deer Off to the test, so I will update this review after rut.As for the spray itself, the battery operated trigger (batteries are included!) is great.  After priming (takes awhile), the spray is ready to go & puts out a nice, steady stream.  The scent is not nasty, so the job of spraying is not bad at all.Deer Off is advertised as safe for use with kids & pets.  My dogs have been in & around the sprayed trees & have exhibited no adverse reaction at all.  They can tell there is some sort of a scent, so they sniff the trees.This product holds promise.  The battery operated sprayer is nice & there was enough repellent to spray 8 trees with some left over.",1338422400,2012-05-31

I hate the tangles mess and the time it takes to get all setup to do a project with the corded tool.This tool has litium ion which holds a charge a long time and has a built in led power guage to let you know when it needs charged.I had a long move and had this in storage for three months. Thinking I would have to recharge for use I pushed the guage button and all four led's lit up letting me know it was still at full charge. That was impressive.Nice and lightweight as well.

5.0,"Up until a few days ago, my biggest lawn enemy was the dreadful crabgrass, hard to kill and even harder to take out from its roots. I was using the painful method, on my knees, small crowbar and depending on the size of the crabgrass and how deep its roots are, it would take me from 5 to 10 minutes to take it out... each!!So I found the Fiskars Uproot Weed and Root Remover...I don't care how long this has been around, I just know one thing...it's what I've been looking for.As I mentioned above, my main pain on my butt has always been crabgrass, reason being, my neighbor doesn't take care of his lawn, and so it is covered with them, somehow they end up on my yard and each year is the same pain for me to get rid of them...UNTIL NOW. So let me give you a simple tip for removing crabgrass (trust me, this afternoon I removed about 20 of them):You want to make sure you know where the root ball is, so spread out any actual grass around the weed and follow the weed's branches; Crabgrass is tricky, you may think you have the Fiskars lined up to the center of the weed, but you may be wrong, crabgrass tends to flatten as it grows, and so the root ball is always off from what you may perceive as the ""center"" of the weed; after moths of being plagued by this pain in the butt weed, I've noticed that its roots are usually spread out, so even with this wonderful tool, you'll most likely have to go in twice or even three times to remove a single crabgrass bunch. However, the younger the weed is, the less roots it has and those usually take only one time with the Fiskars, again, if you first locate the root.Of course, not everything is perfect, and here are a couple of cons about this tool:First, a mix of plastic and metal construction. I heard and felt some straining on the tool when I was removing a very mature crabgrass, but luckily, the tool did not break.Second, and this is more of a WARNING than a con. Since you are removing the weed entirely with its roots, you will leave a HOLE in the ground, more even so when removing crabgrass, since its roots are a mix of curled up hardened roots (again, depending on maturity). So be ready to fill up the holes with dirt. If you have an infestation, I suggest you get some grass seed, some soil and patch up any big holes you leave behind.Other weeds such as dandelions and leafy weeds are easily taken out without much of an impact on the ground. Needles to say, those weeds don't have a prayer...but don't get me wrong, like the title of my review says, with Crabgrass, it is trickier, but does the job.All in all, I couldn't be happier, this is a wonderful invention and has saved me the huge pain of dealing with weeds, literal pain. My back thanks you Fiskars and my neighbors even more, 'cause I don't curse anymore...if anything, they now probably think I'm nuts, since I was literally laughing as I took each weed out! ha!",1399334400,2014-05-06

4.0,"According to Washington University Extension service there are a lot of ways to catch that mole that don't work.  They include Juicy Fruit chewing gum, grub controls (and other insecticides), castor bean/oil concoctions (I tried this), the pitchfork/shovel method, electrocution, tunnel tromping, firearms/explosives, poison baits, attack ferrets, odorous repellents, gassing, flooding, mole repelling flora, vibrating ultrasonic devices, flammable liquids, dogs and cats, crushed glass, rose thorns, razor blades.INSTRUCTIONS:1.  Water the lawn and active area thoroughly.  A wet lawn keeps the mole's food supply close to the surface and makes it easy to place the mole trap in the ground.2.  Locate the active tunnels.  Poke a 1"" hole in the raised earth though to the tunnel.  Wait 24 hours.  If the hole is resealed, the tunnel is active.3.  Press down on the raised earth with your foot,depressing the tunnel roof.  Press the trap into the softened ground, then use foot pegs to firmly set the trap in place.4.  Raise and lower the hand until the spears move freely through the ground making sure that nothing will get in the way of the spears when the mole trips the trap.5.  With feet on foot pegs, raise handle to set the trap.  (This sounds easy, but really takes some strength).Admittedly I've tried that castor oil bit and still had that sinking feeling, not in my stomach, but my darn lawn.  I'd be mowing along and would feel myself sinking in certain sections, some quite deep.  I can count myself fortunate in that I haven't had any infestation like some I've seen that look as if a passel of youngsters with a shovel and pail have been digging away.  Yes, these traps are the only things that will really work, but no, I haven't caught any little moles yet.  This thing is so intimidating, they probably hoofed it off to the neighbor's next door (I hope).",1376179200,2013-08-11
5.0,"Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.----------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch!Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment.",1365724800,2013-04-12
1.0,"At first I thought this product might be awesome -- the idea is that you find an active mole tunnel (the directions tell you how to determine that) then you use the pointy end to open a hole and then put some of the pellets into the tunnel so that the mole will eat it and die.However every time I used the product as instructed the moles never returned to that tunnel. I think this was for two reasons.First the test to find an active tunnel is to push said mounds done then check to see if they are back up the next day... the process of using the bottle's pointed end though also collapses part of the tunnel and if I were a mole and my tunnel had a collapsed section two days in a row, I'd find me a new tunnel (which is what they seemed to have done).Second the process of making said hole to pour the pellets into not only collapses the tunnel around it but actually blocks off the tunnel at that point.  Once more the moles just made a new tunnel.Very disappointing.",1402963200,2014-06-17
1.0,"First let me make it VERY clear that Amazon.com is ALWAYS the best.  Top notch shipping, friendly/professional customer service, timely delivery.  I absolutely love Amazon.com - NEVER have had a single problem.Weber makes incredible products, I personally own three Weber Grills and every family member and most of my friends have since purchased at least one because they admire mine so much.  Now comes in to play Weber Customer Service.....I purchased this smoker Thursday 9/3/09 and had it shipped over night, which of course Amazon.com did perfectly.  Since I knew the smoker was at the house so I stopped at my favorite butcher on the way home from my office, purchasing roughly $200 in meat.  It was to be a great Labor Day Celebration with fine cuts of smoked meat at our annual End of Summer Bash.  I came home and excitedly started putting together the smoker.  However, the charcoal grate simply would not fit, something was amiss.... I called Weber customer service and was notified that I was the 3rd person to call that day with the exact same problem.  In the factory, someone was putting the charcoal grates for the larger Weber smoker in this package which need the smaller.  The customer service representative was incredibly kind and apologetic.  They said they would over night the charcoal great and refund what I had purchased in meat.  I was saddened that my guests would not enjoy what I had so anxiously hoped to serve, but understood that mistakes do indeed happen, and that Weber was doing all it could to make things right.  The party must go on.After the long holiday weekend, Tuesday comes and I expect to come home to a nice fedex package on my front porch containing said charcoal grill.  As I pulled in the drive and to my dismay, no fedex package existed.  Thus, I call Weber customer service.  The first rep. said there was nothing in my ""file"" and that they would never agree to reimburse for the meat - unbelievably rude.  I asked for a supervisor, and was of course, somehow was disconnected.  I called back, and after three attempts finally a supervisor came to the phone.  They said they would be sure to over night the correct grate to me, and they would have to check on the meat reimbursement.  At this point, I didn't care as long as what I already had purchased would finally be complete.Wednesday comes, no grate....I give it another day.....Thursday, no grate.  Four more calls to Weber, two different rude, unprofessional supervisors and assurance the grate would come over night.  Friday....no grate.  Yet another call to Weber, more rude customer service reps and supervisors then a notification that the grate wouldn't ship until October 8th, this would not do at all.  Finally get the VP of Customer Service for Weber, a fellow named Mark.  I understand how he came to his position, you clearly need to be the best at being rude and unprofessional to hold such a prestigious position at Weber.  He of course assured me that they would ship a grate over night and I will receive the grate Tuesday.I for one feel that it was completely ridiculous what I had to go through just to get the product I had already purchased.  This was by far the WORST customer service I've ever received from any company.  I will no longer purchase another Weber product regardless of the quality.  I would rather buy a new grill every year for the rest of my life rather than cook on another Weber.Weber, you have lost a life long customer and several thousands of dollars because of something so ridiculous.  I will never recommend a Weber product again, nor will anyone I know purchase another Weber product.  I will personally purchase from another company and give it to them just to avoid another dollar going into a company that condones such poor customer service......Good Bye Weber!",1252627200,2009-09-11

2.0,"I dislike leaving a negative review if I'm not 100% sure its not my fault but here goes.  We live in a completely wooded area and with fall here the mice are moving into our pole barn and garage.  We keep 4-5 traps out at all times, currently Victor Quick Set or Tomcat ""jaw"" traps.  Decided to try these.Set-up took a little while, when doing it the first time it takes a while to figure out and even then the ring or ""noose"" keeps flying off, took me five tries the first time.  Be careful opening the package or the rings will fall all over the place.  When setting these on the floor the first thing I noticed is they have to be parrallel to the wall (no way it can work if the ring side is facing a wall) which means the mouse has to come from one side for the trap to work, unlike a jaws trap where the mouse can come from right or left.After being out a while we found the ring gone, droppings on the peanut butter bait but no mouse, happened twice.  A search of the area found no mice, so don't know if the mice were not trapped or crawled away to die.While the design is different it seems to have problems.  Hard to set-up, needs replacement rings (20 rings for $7.99 or 39 cents a ring, to be fair the Victor Quick Set trap mechanism seems to break often) and the mouse is not trapped but can wander off it seems like.  My wife hates the idea of the mouse not being attached to the trap and just laying somewhere and we need gloves or whatever to pick it up versus a jaw trap where you just open the jaws and it drops out.  Finally, it may sound dumb, but snap traps do seem more humane and kill quick and clean, usually, instead of strangling the mouse to death.",1352419200,2012-11-09

Even Safer Brand itself makes another powder that you get more than double this amount for about the same price.  If this DEP compound was far more effective it may be worth it.  But I have found it to work, but very slowly, and with no better efficiency or effectiveness than other environmentally safe brands I have used. It's a little early here in New England for any real ant problems so I searched out a mound in the back yard to try it on.  My first impression of this powder was I didn't like the applicator.  This is not a granular mixture but a talc like powder that clogs the hole at the end of the spout quickly.  You have to shake it and squeeze it quite a bit, and often, to get it flowing.  My experience with it had me either pouring out a very thin amount of powder or a whole lot at once.  Once the powder was on the mound the ants crawled through it without any real mind to it other than curiosity.  I have never seen a ""safe"" brand of insecticide yet that killed immediately and this powder was par for the course.  But I think what makes this type of powder eventually effective is that the ants and other crawling pests don't seem to recognize it as poisonous.  Ants will avoid regular chemical type insecticides because the smell seems to alert them that its not safe.  This powder seems to carry no real scent, or give off any indication they are tracking through something deadly.  That I feel is one of the key reasons this powder seems to kill effectively, eventually.  When I returned the next day there was still some activity around, but by the third day all the ants were gone from the area.  No bodies were visible but the mound that was once infested with ants was quiet and barren.  It's good that it works in some time, but I have to wonder how well it would work in a doorway where ants would pass through or over it very quickly with little exposure.  Given the favorable results of most of the other reviews here, I will concede it may be effective in that area as well, but still an expensive alternative.In conclusion, this powder is definitely not a waste of time and money for the sake of being safe.  It does seem to work as long as you have some patience and get it into the areas the ants will frequent as a corridor for their wanderings.  But once again I must take issue with the price of this product when compared to both regular powders, and more environmentally safe ones that are available right here on Amazon.  For that reason 3 stars is the best I can do for this Safer Brand, 5168 compound...",1332547200,2012-03-24

To be a more accurate review I should have made just a pansy specific pot, but I think I can still confidently say that this is a good fertilizer.

That's good to know. I tend to bait the trap a couple of times before actually getting the little critters. They are able to steal the peanut butter from the traps without springing them. But I think now I was setting them on FIRM release. Also I think I was putting too much peanut butter on the trap.But I was always able to get the nasty little rodents using these traps.And they are cheap enough that I don't feel bad about throwing trap and mouse carcass away and not re-using the traps. That has a big yuck factor to me.I would have rated this trap five stars if there had been better instructions on the package.",1401235200,2014-05-28
4.0,"It took a long time to find a place to put this up because of the bolt placement and stud requirement. My house is built from adobe and I cannot anchor things like this to it without pulling it apart. Our barn has studs that are 18 inches and didn't fit. Finally what we did was take a 2x12 and cut it into a rectangle, mount the roller on it and then mount the rectangle of wood on our barn. I don't think you could mount this on cinder block or any of the thinner wooden fencing. This can be a problem as you obviously want it close to a spigot.The unit is VERY heavy. This is both good and bad. Good in that it is not a piece of junk, bad in that you need some serious support to hold it while you yank a hose out of it.I like the tray, great for an extra nozzle or hose splitter.We put a maxflow hose that is only 50 feet so lots of spare room on the winding wheel.Kind of a bummer that there is no auto retraction, but-- hey, it is very attractive and much nicer than the two plastic units I have.",1396828800,2014-04-07

In fact, for leaf blowing and similar, I find the low setting is all I need, because the air flow is so well directed. Plus, the low speed is very quiet for a leaf blower, not much louder than a blow dryer. It also seem quite well made and solid. Of course, it is corded, so if you have a really big yard, you might do well with a battery-powered or gas model. But if a corded model will work for you, I would buy this and the save money. I definitely recommend this.",1346976000,2012-09-07
5.0,"I previously owned the much older version the Weber Q200 for almost 10 years now and it was about time for a replacement. It has a new improved look! The biggest differences I can tell is the grate now comes in TWO pieces and heating controls are redesigned.  The Weber Q2000 looks more sleek and rounder.Time has also taken a toll on the appearance on my old Q200. Also I have had to replace the burner once and the ignition part that sparks inside the grill when the push button ignition is pushed. Those are parts that over the years get coated with juices from the meats you cook and also rust over with time. I also once replaced the gas regulator. The replacement arts are very inexpensive. I was able to get the ignition part and gas regulator directly from Weber and purchased the burner on Amazon.  So just remember when it comes to replacement parts, Amazon and Weber are great options to get them at reasonable prices.I already possess the grill standWeber 6549 Weber Q Rolling Cartand cover which will work with the Q2000. It typically sits on my deck with a 20lb propane tank. The grill is perfect to take along on fishing and camping trips and use portable small 16 ounce propane tanks. The grill's cast iron porcelain-enameled grates will last forever. They heat up quickly and cook evenly. Another great accessory is the Griddle insert for making scramble eggs and breakfast. I highly recommend investing in a wire brush to keep the burner holes clean from food and burnt in grease.I like to use a cover on the grill because it sits out in the open on my deck. If you don't have a cover on it, the drip trays will fill up with water and spill over on days it rains because of the rounded shape of the grill. The drip trays are great since they are just aluminum trays that are removable and you just throw them away. However they are not easy to find. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find them, not even retail hardware chain stores carry them in our area. Here is the link to the drip trays:Weber 6415 Small 7-1/2-Inch-by-5-inch Aluminum Drip Pans, Set of 10Overall I love my Weber Grill and I would prefer this type of grill to those big stainless steel types.",1390435200,2014-01-23

I have used these same ingredients to keep cats (off the porch) and squirrels (off the birdhouses) away. I have discovered that, like this, it is sometimes effective. Most animals do not like pepper and will learn to stay away. However, there are some--not many--who do not have the aversion.The one thing I particularly like about this product is that the granular shaker bottle makes it easy to spread the product as well as store it.

5.0,"These bird spikes are not the cruel item that they look like. In fact they can protect birds by keeping their nests away from dangerous areas.For the past few years birds have tried to nest in a hanging flower basket by my front door. The one year they succeeded and laid eggs, every time the door opened or someone came up on the porch they flew away in a panic, swinging the basket and in the process lost an egg. This wasn't too pleasant for any of the humans that got near it either. I also had birds try to nest in the rafters under my deck where they then panicked anytime someone stepped out on to it.These spikes solved that problem. I had previously been using plastic forks. These look better and are also more effective. I used a bolt cutter to snap the 10 foot spikes into smaller pieces that would fit into the under deck areas. They really did not break/snap into shorter lengths. I also used screws and an electric screwdriver to fasten them which was better than trying to drive nails. I put a small piece in my hanging basket and covered the base of it with potting soil after securing it with toothpicks.The result is the birds have found better places and the humans are happier too.",1398729600,2014-04-29
5.0,This comes in a handy spray bottle and is very easy to use. How well it works is subject to personal opinion when compared to other products.

I have sprayed it on my roses and will apply additional treatments as directed. It is working well in eliminating insects.

4.0,"This unit works reliably as described and being able to remove the programming module is a real benefit, but there are some shortcomings that need to be considered.  On the plus side, the thing works.  That's important to me as I tried another that wasn't so reliable and since I'm on a well and would be away when the unit is on, having it function correctly ranks very high on my list of required features.  Even if the battery runs out (it's suppose to last all season) the unit quits in the off position, so the water is not left running until the well is dry.A feature that I like very much is that the electronic module slips out of the spigot attachment bar easily so you can see the screen better for programming or reprogramming.  Sometimes a spigot is located where visibility is poor and it helps me particularly because the screen is not large and the instructions on the flip up cover are really tiny.  The programming would not be intuitive to me, but with the instructions right there, it's easy enough.Thanks to other reviewers, I had the two 9V batteries on hand, but didn't heed the advice to have a Y connector on hand for a second hose for manual use. I thought I could easily reset the unit to allow that.  Well, you can hand water by pushing the button for manual operation, but then you also have to set the number of minutes you intend to be watering manually, after which it resets to auto/run, and you can't just hit the program off button because 'off' doesn't allow water to flow.The problem is I have no idea how long I'll be using the hose manually.  It could be the standard 10'ish minutes of watering the hanging baskets, but I may want to alter that routine for some reason this time or I may be interrupted or maybe the dog bowl needs filling or a trash can needs to be washed or the car.  You get the picture.  In short, I don't know how many minutes I need and don't want to think about that every time, nor hold the + button for lots of minutes just in case.  That's just way more effort than I want to put into using the water for a dozen reasons (especially when it's over 100 outside).  Having the Y connector avoids that problem if the timer is to be installed on a frequently used spigot.The other brand I tried before (that I returned for non-performance) allowed for two hoses so I hadn't considered the extra annoyance of switching repeatedly from the hand-use nozzle to the sprinkler, nor the fact that my main hose is white and doesn't look very good snaked out through the yard to the sprinkler location (normally it's wrapped up after each use on a hose cart).  Sigh.  I've now ordered a Y connector and have to wait to hook it up.  (Yes, I know, why didn't I just drive in town to get one at the hardware store--well, I did, and the dumb thing leaked, so I've ordered a higher quality unit.) Who knew this would be so complicated.I do wish I could review my watering program as with the other unit, but that isn't an option with this one. It does show the time and day and you can push various buttons to see what you'd set as start time and duration.  Speaking of which, you will not want to reset start time very often because the buttons are rather hard to push and you have to hold the + or - button forever while it starts at 12am and moves up or down by the minute (not hour then minute, just minute, all 60 of them each hour) to reach your desired time.Bottom line, I'm not thrilled with some of this unit's features, but it works and that is the top priority.  With a separate hose for other watering activities, I'll be satisfied with this timer to handle my automated watering needs and feel confident while I'm away.",1278201600,2010-07-04

5.0,"Although relatively harmless, earwigs are a disgusting looking insect and I certainly don't want them in my home. Three years ago after moving into our current house, we were overrun with the creepy crawlers. Apparently a combination of moisture and dark crushed granite (they like dark ground cover) was the perfect breeding ground for hoards of them. Worse yet, not satisfied with the great outdoors, they began crossing the threshold and entering the house.When it comes to pesticides, I look for natural alternatives. In my research, diatomaceous earth came up again and again as both safe and effective. Now I've been using it for three years and have found it to work beautifully and safely on both the small carpenter ants that appear near the outside of my garage and the earwigs that live around my back door.Because the consistency is like talcum powder, applying it is a little tricky. After trial and error, including the pointless purchase of an insecticide duster that spent more time clogged up than working, I use a hair color applicator bottle (similar to a classic ketchup or mustard squeeze bottle - thin cylinder with pointy spout) to have greater control when applying the powder. I do like the container the Safer product is packaged in because it will make refilling the smaller container I use infinitely easier.If washed away by rain or tracked away by humans/domestic animals, the powder needs to be reapplied.  Apply near the entrance into the house - the point is that they must walk through the powder. So, it isn't important to find their nest, just make it impossible for them to avoid the powder while trying to enter the house.If it isn't possible to catch them before they are inside, leave a little trail of powder on the floor where you have seen them walking. During my worst year with the earwigs I sprayed a small line of powder next to the baseboard by the back door. Within a couple of days there were no more earwigs. Again, it is important to reapply the powder, which is no different than most pesticides that wash away in the rain or lose potency with time. And, much as I wish there were a less messy way, I am not willing to sacrifice safety.The importance of the safety of this product for use in my home is why I have remained a loyal user. I have two older dogs, one with a terminal illness. The last thing I want around her with her weakened immune system are any toxic chemicals. My internet research revealed this product was initially used for worming dogs, (this product is not food safe, so please do not use it for any other but its stated purpose) so when the dogs or humans residing in this house walk through the product, there are no worries. Main warnings are that the product is an eye irritant and shouldn't be inhaled.In past years as the seasons moved from Winter to Spring and Summer I sometimes had difficulty locating diatomaceous earth. It was frequently out of stock -- I guess it was a matter of demand. Price is relative because when I couldn't find it locally, I paid much more than is being asked for this Safer brand product. In my household, diatomaceous earth is indispensible.After three years I am sold on this as a solution for earwigs and ants.",1332979200,2012-03-29
5.0,"I've used this brand and the Schultz brand of rooting hormone with good results.  I have the best results when I use cutting from new growth early in the season.For good results you should have very clean cutting tools (sterilized with bleach or rubbing alcohol), fresh perlite or a &#34;light&#34; potting soil & a sterilized container.I cut a bunch of fresh growth woody stems then I take them back to my work area and I cut them to about 8&#34; long near a &#34;node&#34;, remove all the leaves but one, make sure the cut end is cut at an angle, wet the stems & then dip them in the rooting compound & then push into the perlite or potting soil.  You can put them very close together - 1&#34; or so apart.  I always cut several more than I need because they won't all survive.  If you get lucky & they all grow, you'll have plants to share.Keep out of sunlight & keep moist but not too wet or they will rot.  It may take a couple weeks (depends on the plant) but I check them by VERY gently pulling on a stem to see if roots are growing.  If there is a bit of tension when you pull, you probably have roots.  Try not to pull them all the way out or you'll break the tender growth.The cuttings usually spend a couple months in the pot & then I separate them & plant them in 4-6&#34; pots.  You could even plant them in the ground in a very protected area where you can keep watch over them for another season.  I sometimes put them in a small corner in my garden so they can grow undisturbed until they are big enough to move.It all depends on the type of plant you are propagating.  If it's an easy woody plant to grow, it will probably be easy to root from cuttings.  I've had really good luck (plenty to give away) with Limelight Hydrangea, varieties of Ninebark & Forsythia.",1393545600,2014-02-28
5.0,"I've always wanted a smoker, but wasn't willing to spend the money on a top of the line model. Plus, being a bit of a lazy cook, I wanted to get something that didn't involve a lot of fuss and muss.So, when I saw this Brinkman electric smoker, I thought I'd give it a shot. While Amazon is my usual place to shop, I have to confess I got this from the big box home improvement store (""depot""). They had it on the web site for less than half the Amazon price with free shipping. Plus had a coupon that took several more dollars off the price. Couldn't pass it up. Granted, the one I got did not include the cover, but that's not a problem since it will get stored in a sheltered area.The construction quality is not what you would call top-notch, but acceptable for the price. Assembly is straightforward - need a screwdriver and pliers. You will also need to season the smoker before using it for real. Simple process - just coat the inside with vegetable oil and then run it for 3 or so hours.Easy to use and the food is wonderful. I mean wonderful!! And so easy - basically just fill the pan with water, put in some wood chunks, put on the food and leave it alone for a few hours. That's the type of cooking I like!Clean up is a bit more involved since you have to clean the water pan and the grates. But both fit into the dishwasher, so I only have to wait for things to cool then toss them in for cleaning.I'm sure the smoking purists will scoff at the idea of an electric model, and the more expensive ones will probably last longer and work better. I'm also sure that this does not have the power to work well in very cold temperatures. But for summertime smoking, you can't get better than this for the money (assuming you get it at the depot) . Highly recommend!Note: I was also very impressed by the customer service from Brinkman. The water pan had a big dent in it from shipping (the depot shipped it in just the manufacturer box, and it must of taken a hit from UPS). The dent was deep enough that it cracked the metal, and I was concerned about long-term leaks and rust. I called Brinkman and five days later, a new water pan arrived via FedEx. No hassles, no forms, just quick, polite, effective service. Rare to find that these days.",1277510400,2010-06-26

4.0,"My landlord's house is between two rental houses, one of which we are in. The land is beautiful sweeping mountain land they have planted with apple trees, grapes, and a variety of flowers and bushes. We have a communal garden plot as well as a communal chicken coop. My landlord loves the deer that come and has planted an area just for them to browse. But their well-worn path into the area goes right through the apple trees and too close to the tempting garden plot.We are under no illusions that the deer will go away, nor would we really want them to. We enjoy sharing the land with all the critters that come here and, rather than trying to eliminate nuisances, we prefer to seek balance in the ecosystem using permaculture principles and simple deterrents that help the critters make choices that just happen to work out better for us as well.What we are experimenting with now with these deer-repellent stakes is diverting the path of the deer so they skirt the apple trees and garden and head, instead, for the browsing area that ought to give them plenty to eat. I have yet to catch the deer in their act so I can't report yet on how effectively the stakes work for our purposes, but the fact that I haven't seen them at all is saying something. When the apple trees start to flower, that's when we'll have a better sense of how well the stakes are working at refocusing the deer.

5.0,"If there is such a thing as a ""luxury garden hose"", this SCOTTS MAXFLEX PREMIUM HEAVY DUTY GARDEN HOSE is it!  What I like best is the heavy brass coupling that attaches to the outdoor water spigot.  My garden hoses always want to leak at the coupling, but this coupling is firm and tight.What I like least is the bright yellow stripe down the center of the bright green hose.  The stripe is much more noticeable than you would expect from the product page photo, although it's not all that hard to get used to.Unlike the cheap garden hoses that I've been using, this hose is made of ""drinking water safe"" materials, and includes a ""bacteria/mold inhibitor"" to protect the hose.  However, to keep the hose safe for drinking water, it needs to be drained when not in regular use.  As the instructions say, ""Water left in a hose for extended periods of time may result in the formation of bacteria.""This garden hose does NOT kink easily, and it's easy to coil back onto the hose holder after use.  To maximize the hose life, I always drain out some water after I turn off the spigot, because I use a ""control-top"" garden spray nozzle.  Sunlight or cold can expand the water left inside, and cause the hose to burst or leak prematurely.  The instructions recommend storing the hose indoors ""when not in use"", which I think means during the winter months.The hose has a limited lifetime warranty against defects in materials or workmanship ""under normal, residential, non-commercial use, for the 'Warranty Period'"".  Defective hoses will be exchanged for new ones of equal or better quality.",1394323200,2014-03-09

5.0,I'm a beginner gardener even though I've been a home owner for 11 years. I've always had a yard guy and never liked it much. I decided to get into it this year and have had a good time cleaning up my backyard. This trowel is lightweight and strong and I would recommend it.,1394928000,2014-03-16
3.0,"While I am happy that this flower pot holder seems sturdy enough to hold a fairly large pot, weighted down with soil and water, I'm not sure how long it will hold up in outside conditions.The basket comes with two removable 'L' brackets that can be positioned with the 'long' side up an horizontal to the ground for wider railings or short side up and horizontal to the ground for shorter railings. There are three bolts and nuts to hold it together.The problem started for me on the install. My prefab (plastic) railings are just a hair too wide to use the short side of the L bracket so if I use the long side of the bracket it sticks out into the basket area by inches. Which means that any flower pot put inside is then hindered by the brackets taking up some of the valuable area to place your pot. I also had trouble trying to tighten the nuts to keep it together since they are underneath the bracket arm. You have to tighten them and then put it back on the railing.There is a part that rests against your banister to keep the basket in a level position.It's nice but not great. Since everyone's railings are different, I guess designing a better one is a tough task. This one is recommended with some reservation.",1370304000,2013-06-04
2.0,My original review was a five star. I am dropping it to two and I will explain below.The older Gilmour soaker hoses are excellent if you have one that was made before 2012 HANG ON TO IT AND DON'T LET IT GO.THE HOSES THEY SELL NOW ARE NOT THE QUALITY ONES THEY SOLD ONLY A YEAR OR TWO AGO.I own several of the older hoses. I needed two more. I ordered them and the new is not the same quality as the old. The old ones have two seams and are heavy duty. On the older ones if you had a kink in the line all you had to do was turn the water on and the hose would straighten itself out. Not so with the new ones. Once they are kinked they stay kinked. This is an issue with me because I run mine through cattle panels that I tie my tomato plants to. It's harder for me to get the kinks out in a system like this. It was not an issue with the older hoses.The newer hoses do not water as evenly as the old. Oh they are still a good hose but not nearly as good as they were just a few years ago.I am not sure but I think the price of the new hose is higher than the old. So basically they have reduced their costs by making a lower quality hose and increased their profits even more by charging a higher price. I still need more hoses but they will not be the Gilmour brand. Their short term business practices have lost them a long term customer because I now have to assume that they have probably lowered the quality on all their products.I dislike doing reviews like these. I really like my old Gilmour hoses and originally wrote a glowing review on them. I think that is what irritated me the the most. People may have bought the newer hoses based on my review. I'm glad Amazon lets us edit these reviews even after they are a couple of years old.If Gilmour changes back to selling the old high quality hose I will edit this review again.,1310515200,2011-07-13
3.0,"These rat snap traps are designed to be easily set with bait and to reliably snap and kill the rat when the rat goes after the bait. While these are pretty good at functioning as designed (in my experience) this is a messy way to kill a rat. The snapping teeth will often cut and maim a rat without instantly killing it, and this is cruel to the rat and unpleasant for the person wishing to exterminate the rat. When this caught and killed a rat I just threw it away rather than trying to extricate the rat and clean the trap for reuse. For reusable traps I recommend the electronic ones, that will electrocute the rat when it goes in after the bait. Those electronic traps work well indoors but can't be used outdoors. With any trap it is important to bait it and place it properly, and to check it regularly. The Tomcat snap trap is fairly good at killing rats but not a clean, humane method. It is OK for some people but it's not my preference. I've tried multiple types of rat traps and none are perfect, so I would say it's important to consider the pros and cons of each design relative to what your specific needs are.",1404172800,2014-07-01

This is a theoretical situation. I would caution you to watch your fingers and set it very carefully. also, sometimes, rats do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the rat in it. Traps in general are hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can't get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don't want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead rat, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped rat.",1404604800,2014-07-06

It could use a glass top as it's not overly stiff and heavy drinks may fall over if the bases of the glasses aren't overly wide.  We plan to use a drink tray and coasters.

I may try adding some wire to move the feeder away from the branch. Cleaning is a little more difficult than some of my other feeders because of the greater number of parts. Ease of filling is about average, similar to other cheap feeders that I have.

The soil grabbed the blades and wouldn't close on the rodent. This Sweeney trap works on a completely different principle. When the mole trips the trap it gets stabbed by four ""nails"" that shoot at high-speed into the soil. I'm not going to go over the instructions because there's a video posted that shows you how to use the trap. I did find it very easy to set and clean up after. I kept the soil moist in the area so the soil didn't harden too much. It worked perfectly.

4.0,"I see a lot of negative reviews for this bird feeder on Amazon. Maybe it's because this is my first-ever bird feeder, but it seems to work just fine for me. Other reviewers have said that birds can't access the seed, but I work from home and see birds feeding from this feeder all day long. The only problem I had was with squirrels when I hung the feeder on a branch that was too close to the trunk of the tree. In that location, squirrels could climb the trunk of the tree and then lean over and sneak seed out of the feeder without putting all their weight on it. I solved that problem by moving the feeder to another branch, further away from the trunk. Now any squirrel that tries to get seed by climbing on the feeder gets shut out when the feeder slams shut from the squirrel's weight. Like I said, maybe it's because I'm a bird feeder neophyte; but this feeder seems like a decent product to me.",1379980800,2013-09-24

5.0,"I think most of the other 5 star reviews cover what I would have said. The 13"" model that ordered is a little short for me (I am 6'1"") and maybe the balance is a little heavy on the end. However, after using the item for a few weeks, it has performed very well and I am satisfied I made the best choice. The other user of this item is an 80+ yr old grandmother and she likes it too.We used to be die-hard Black & Decker or Sears buyer for this type of item, but found the quality to have declined over the years. Based on the strength of the reviews here and the cost, we went with this item.Last thing: there is an extra spool with the unit, but the recommended additional string Amazon suggests does not come in a spool. I guess we will have to re-string manually and I have not gotten to that point, so I cannot comment on that aspect. Still, as far as price vs performance, this was a good buy. Highly recommended for basic home needs.*************ADDED 8/2/13Just following up. The unit has been working fine with no issues. While maybe the balance in weight could be a tad better and the length could be an inch or two longer, the overall performance has been fine.

5.0,"tried a number of tactics to get rid of them, with no luck. Our most recent tactic was poison, but I was far from thrilled with that as I have a dog. So, I was very pleased when I was offered this mole trap.I first read the instructions so that I would learn the proper way to set the trap up. After I had determined which tunnel was getting active traffic (the tunnel getting reopened by the little stinkers), I set the trap up there. I was pleased to see that the spike of the trap rest at ground level so that the dog could not get his nose into the trap.It took three nights, but we finally got our first mole, and I am very pleased.The trap has a sturdy construction and the spring which powers it has a lot of force for spearing into the ground. True, it will probably not penetrate hard packed earth, but that is not how it is intended for use.Is this a perfect trap, a magic wand for removing vermin? Definitely no. But, it does seem to do the job that it is intended to do. I can see that for a major infestation, it is probably wisest to use several of these traps.(Review of Sweeney's 9015 Deadset Precision Mole Trap)",1374796800,2013-07-26
5.0,"But please, remember where you left it.  You don't want to find a little pile of skeletons and fur in the bottom.First I put it under the kitchen sink, but I think the cats have really decimated our domestic mouse population. No takers, no one even tasted the bait.  then I put it in the wool shed where I knew we had an active problem.  The first time I forgot to turn it on, and the peanut butter was licked clean, so I re-baited and turned it on again.  Other than putting wool in and taking wool out, there is no reason to go out there.  When I remembered, it had been out there for over a month in the hottest part of the year, against the west wall of an unshaded shed.I couldn't really count the remains, but there were many.  Next time I will put newspaper in the bottom. It smelled like fly trap attractant which is why I'm going on about checking it frequently.The light was still flashing after four weeks, so it is economical with power.  There was still peanut butter left, so I think I cleared out the neighborhood.This is really a clever machine for those of you who worry about children and pets getting into your snap traps or poisons. It seems to kill very quickly and humanely.If you're just squeamish, and don't have someone to empty this for you, I'd look for something else, But for us it's a winner.",1314230400,2011-08-25

5.0,"In addition to owning a composite-sided two story house, I have a front porch, a back deck, a shed, a large playground set, a wooden fence, many pieces of plastic lawn furniture, and a lot of sidewalk/paving stones that seem to  accumulate so much mold/grime that I have to clean them off every few years.  I already own an electric pressure washer, and while it is a good unit, it has some problems getting stuff completely clean, particularly my wooden fence.  So, I was happy to be given the opportunity to evaluate this unit, the Champion Power Equipment No.76522 Trigger Start 3000PSI Portable Gas Powered Pressure Washer.  Below are some of my pros and cons for this pressure washer:Pros:- Assembly was fairly quick and easy.  You'll need a couple of common tools (a couple of wrenches, and some pliers), but if you're the type of person to buy a gas-powered pressure washer, you're the type of person who already has these tools.  :-)- Wow, there is a lot of difference between 1800 PSI and 3000 PSI when it comes to getting things clean.  And I can cover more area when washing per pass with this unit than with my electric pressure washer, which means that it takes a lot less time to get the job done.- I like the trigger start/stop technology.  Pull the trigger and the engine starts up (no cord to pull), and let go of the trigger and after about 15 seconds, the unit stops.  Pull the trigger again and it starts up again.  This saves you effort, gas (the engine only runs when you need it), and mess.- The 25 foot hose is a good length, and is longer than what came with my electric pressure washer, which means less moving the unit around, and more importantly, it gives me more flexibility when I'm up on the ladder cleaning my siding.  As most of you know, it's a BAD idea to angle a pressure washer nozzle upwards when cleaning siding, as you're likely to force water into the seams and behind the siding.  So, with the extra length, it's easier to keep everything on the level, so to speak.  :-)- At close to 100 pounds and fairly wide, this pressure washer is more stable than my electric one when I'm using it.Cons:- Maintenance and the like is a lot more complicated for this machine than for an electric model.  Oil needs to be changed (it takes 0.63 quarts), the battery should be recharged every month, the sparkplug may need to be gapped, etc.  You also have to ""winterize"" the unit.- At close to 100 pounds and fairly wide, it's a lot bigger than my electric one, making it harder to store and maneuver up and down steps (although it's not too bad for its size)Other impressions: I've found that pre-treating the surface to be cleaned is still a good idea, even with all the extra PSI this unit has. Or you can use the detergent hose that's included to do a low-pressure detergent wash of the surface, followed by a high pressure rinse.  Also, as might be expected from a gas engine, the pressure washer runs fairly loudly, although it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, and it's not as noisy as my leaf blower (but what is, eh?)Is this the pressure washer for you?  That comes down to how much you need to use it and how tough your stains are.  An electric model is fine for most jobs, is much easier to maintain and store, and is less costly (about a third the price of a gas powered model).  But if you have a lot of things you need to pressure wash, then a gas powered model will save you time, and if you have a lot of tough stains, it will do a better job of cleaning the really tough stains/mold/grime.  Overall, this is a very good machine for the person who needs a serious pressure washer.  Five stars.",1352160000,2012-11-06

The base is sealed and with many small hard to reach spaces inside I can't see how it can be cleaned. The neck of the bottle is very narrow. Even with a bottle brush it's hard to reach all the area inside.,1371513600,2013-06-18
3.0,"Even considering just Motomco's rodent control products, there's enough to drive a person crazy. Snap traps, glue traps, spin traps, and several different types of bait stations. Of them all, poisons are perhaps the last I'd choose (except maybe the glue traps... I hate to see animals suffer like that). While I'm not a fan of poisons (I prefer snap traps), there are four different, very similar products, and it's hard to keep them straight:Mouse Killer (this product): Disposable, kid and pet safe, and can be used both indoors and outdoors.Mouse Killer I(Best choice!): Refillable, kid and pet safe, and both indoors/outdoors.Mouse Killer II: Disposable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoors only.Mouse Killer III: Refillable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoor only.Of the four, Mouse Killer I makes the most sense to me. It's as safe as they get, and refillable (and therefore more cost-effective in the long run). They all come with the same poison, so there's no difference there. This one has an additional covering over the entrance the others don't have, making it a little more tamper resistant, and a bit more attractive to mice, which like such things.The disadvantage of poisons? They don't work right away, and the rodents may go off and die in a place where you can't get to them, but their rotting corpses still stink up your house.My preferred option is stillsnap traps, which are infinitely reusable without purchasing additional products (poisons, etc), and much cheaper, especially when obtained at a local hardware store.",1403740800,2014-06-26
4.0,"To address some things in other reviews:1) My Hydrofarm box was packed inside another box with padding materials, unlike others who've complained that theirs was not and thus arrived damaged.2) The frame was not warped, twisted, or otherwise misshapen.3) Mine does have the blinds-like pull string to adjust the height quickly and easily, no s-hooks in sight.Those points addressed, overall, this is a solid product.Yes, there's only a single bulb, so your plants may tend to grow toward it instead of directly upward. This product would not be a good choice for plants that are going to grow indoors and only indoors unless they have a single stem that can be directly under the light. It's much better suited to starting seedlings that will be transplanted outdoors or moved into a cold frame after they've grown a few inches.There are only two flaws in this product that i've found:First, the cord for the light is stiff, and wedges against the frame and pushes the light into an odd angle. You can fix this quickly with zip ties or string or anything of that ilk. Just loosely tie the cord to the vertical bar of the frame, and the problem is solved.Second, it comes with two screws and two washers for each screw. In the assembly instructions, it says to use two washers with each screw, but then shows a picture of the screw, a washer, and a bolt. It's left to the assembler to determine in which order to place the washers.For a backyard gardener or farmer who wants to get their plants started indoors, this will do nicely. If you need to do any intensive indoor gardening, this product will not make you happy because it is not designed for that. The reason it's so inexpensive is because it's a simple, cheap frame with a single light bulb. It does what it's designed for and not a bit more.",1297814400,2011-02-16
5.0,"Please see images. This is a BIG bird feeder, it holds nearly 5 lbs at a time! I like to use the ""waste free"" bird seeds, so it costs about $12.50 to fill this! It looks great, features a clever spring clamp to keep the lid on tight and squirrels frustrated. The sides are a kind of clear hard plastic. My old bird feeder featured a tube made of similar material which oxidized over time, so I'll see how this ages.The lower section, the lower cylinder, relies on four tabs formed in the plastic to hold on to the middle divider. The top cylinder on the unit I received had two of the four tabs broken off (see images) but since the top lid doesn't rely on them, it's not a big deal. The next time I have the Crazy Glue out I'll try and glue the broken tabs back on there.I've got the feeder filled and hung, but I'm still waiting for birds to discover it. After the ""economic downturn"" putting bird seed out was one of the things I cut back on. So I'm looking forward to the local birds re-discovering the feeder in the backyard.Really nice bird feeder. Very attractive design. Holds a lot of bird seed. Looks fairly squirrel-proof.",1369267200,2013-05-23
4.0,"I have to admit to a love for gadgetry. I love checking out all the new gadgets, and trying a few.  One of my favorite mechanical gadgets I've tried recently is the Cuts + More multi-purpose scissors made by Fiskars.Fiskars, the oldest company in Finland having been founded 360 years ago, is the creator of the original orange-handled scissors that has become a household favorite in America. Fiskars, which specializes in hand tools, released the world's first plastic-handled scissors in 1967.Cuts + More attracted my attention because of all the tasks it performs, somewhat like the famed Swiss Knife. The function that really caught my eye is that you can easily take the scissors apart and use one blade as a knife, especially as a box-cutter. That strength, however, is also the products weakness because in my experience the scissors come apart when I don't want it to and then I have to take time to make it one-piece again.The scissors has one notch that allows it to be used as a wire cutter and another notch so it can cut twine. A power notch on one blade can be used to cut light rope. The other blade has a bottle opener, although how often do we use bottle openers anymore? And the same blade has a pointed awl tip.The titanium steel blades are very sharp and cut easily. The Cut + More scissors boost the company's patented ergonomic handles. Another nice feature is that this tool is shipped with its own sheath which contains a blade sharpening tool.After trying out the Cut + More, I was going to put it in my gadget drawer but had second thoughts. This is useful enough to keep it in a handier spot because it's a tool I will be using often.",1306368000,2011-05-26

5.0,"Love it! This was my first drip irrigation installation and it was very simple to install. Really wish I would have done it sooner. I paired it with a Melnor Aqua Timer and it's working like a charm. Matches brown mulch fairly well, but I do plan to cover it up with more mulch.I thought the kit had quite a good assortment for a starter kit. I personally needed more than one end cap and a few more galvanized stakes to curve around shrubbery as the tubing is kind of stiff (small pruning shears will cut the tubing, maybe even scissors). The great thing is that all of the Rain Bird items did arrive in only one Amazon box.The 1 GPH emitters make it easy to give more water to plants that like it wet if you have plants with various watering needs, and the tool makes those very easy to pop into the side of the tubing.

Spraying into the crack between my garage floor and the driveway and the crack between my patio and the house sent several bugs scurrying out into the open.  I also sprayed the rest of the perimeter of my foundation.

4.0,"First the good. I love the looks of this grill. It is sleek, styling and iconic and I enjoy seeing it on my porch.- It is much more attractive than one of those monstrous gas grills.- It seals very tightly.- Its simple style allows you to cook many different meats in many different ways.- There are so many accessories available for it and they are easy to find.Now the bad. Besides the black metal kettle part, everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal. I wouldn't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic. Again, I would not buy a children's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let's face it. This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill. You are paying for quality and looks. I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply isn't a viable competitor right now. If there were other options it would not have fared so well. I feel like Weber has taken advantage of their good name and market share and is allowing their quality to suffer.Shockingly, I would buy it again.",1248998400,2009-07-31
3.0,"I used this battery operated clipper for a few years, and while I was never completely satisfied with its performance it wasn't worth the effort to return or buy a new one.  My two biggest complaints with the clipper were:1) The battery life (or lack of it).  The clipper would only run for about 15 minutes on a charge and after about 5-8 minutes the power and clipping ability went way down.2) When the battery started to lose it oomph (see item #1), small twigs would get wedged between the blades and cause the clipper to freeze.  At this point I had to stop and remove the wood fragments before the clipper would start working again.Well after the last tiny twig got wedged between the blades the clipper refused to work.  It is fully charged, but when I turn it on the motor makes a whirling noise, the blades only move about a 1/4 inch and then freezes again.I got three years of use out of this clipper so I guess I got my money's worth (hence the 3 stars), but it is a shame that a hedge clipper can be destroyed by the hedge it is clipping.",1367625600,2013-05-04

4.0,"Taking cuttings from houseplants and overwintered annuals is an inexpensive and easy way for me to create plants for my spring garden. Using rooting hormone makes this process a lot easier than trying to root plants in water. Sure, some plants love water - like vines and spider plants - and sprout roots in days, but for most other plants I would lose half of them to rotting before there were enough roots to put them in soil.I used the TakeRoot Rooting Hormone on cuttings from a favorite Geranium and a red Angel Wing Begonia. I made a sharp cut, wet the stems, dipped each into a small cap-full of hormone and put the cutting in potting soil. I find cuttings root better using small pots, about 2&#34; x 2&#34;.  I kept them towards the back of my garden window away from full sun but still receiving lots of daylight. The hormone worked and the plants are ready for larger pots.At only 2 oz, this looks like a small container, but a little goes a long way.

4.0,"The first thing I saw when I opened up my Gro-ables were the words ""plant just after last frost, some of these plants don't like the heat"".  It's about 104 outside.  I'm sure they'll be fine, right? Needless to say, the majority of the seedpods are staying in their pods until next year.There were a few items though in my ""salad and herb garden kit"" that I knew would probably be ok here in South Texas, with a little bit of help and shelter.I like the idea of the seed pods. Their arrow shape makes it very easy to sink these into the soil. The biodegradable pod is nothing new though - in fact it's pretty common for folks who start from seed.Many folks have pointed out that these kits aren't really cost-effective, and I find that to be nominally true. In order to set yourself up for something like the Gro-ables, you'd have to buy something likeHydrofarm JS36PR Jumpstart 36-Pellet Indoor Seed StartwithJiffy Peat Pots, or a setup similar toFerry Morse Seed Co 5272 Jiffy Professional Greenhouse. On top of that, you'd actually have to buy the seed for each individual plant. At the end of it all, you'll end up with a larger total number of plant-able material, but the cost will probably be just as expensive, or maybe even more so (yes, I know that if you went completely DIY you could just use an egg crate and some high quality soil, but lets assume someone wants a store-bought solution). For someone who wants a simple, all-in-one solution, the Gro-ables aren't a bad idea.Where they lost me, though, is the inclusion of the Miracle-Gro fertilizer. It seems a very odd combination to include non-GMO stamped on the product, but not Organic (I've generally found that the people who worry about one, worries about the other).As far as functionality and ease of use goes, I would say that this product rates high - five stars. However the value and forced inclusion of fertilizer knocks it down a star in my eyes. If Miracle-Gro would see fit to release just the empty pods as a product, or an organic + non-GMO version of the Gro-ables, I think that would be pretty nice.",1375315200,2013-08-01
2.0,"Update and downgrade. I'm downgrading this to two stars because the birds simply don't like it. I've had it up or a long time now and it is surrounded by four other feeders that all do a brisk business. This feeder has the same seed and yet the birds try it once and then ignore it. I'm convinced the seed is simply too difficult to extract and so the bird give up. There are much better feeders on the market and I would start with any feeder from Droll Yankee such asDroll Yankees YF Flipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder. Updated on 1/24/2014.I have a large ""feeder station"" outside of a picture window in my den and over the years I've tried a lot of feeder designs--some just because I was looking for the best made and best designed feeders and some because I wanted to defeat squirrels. I'm in Connecticut and there are lots of gray squirrels here and they are amazingly clever (and funny) when it comes to getting food from a bird feeder. And they are determined little creatures. I finally found a method to keep squirrels out of my feeders 100% of the time, and I'll get to that at the end of this review. But I'm still willing to try new ideas and it would be fun to find a feeder that solves the squirrel issue all on its own. I'm not sure that this feeder does that, but time will tell.This is a larger feeder than I thought it was going to be-and that's a pleasant surprise.  It also seems pretty well made, but I have some doubts about some of its construction features. Here are some pros & cons:Pros:*The dome on top and the lid look as though they'll keep the food dry from rain or snow entering through the top of the feeder. Wet food can grow mold and that is very dangerous to birds.*As I said it's a large-capacity feeder and  holds three pounds of seed. That's pretty substantial, so I like that feature.*It was simple to assemble, all that  you really have to do is attach the lid at the top of the tube and then put the hanging loop (using a small nut) on the dome. Took less than two minutes to assemble everything. Unlike the Droll Yankee feeders that I use, the perches were already installed and that saves time. On many of the Droll Yankee feeders you have to tap them through holes in the plastic tube and that requires freezing the posts (to shrink them) and that's a pain.*Overall it seems very well made, but with a bird feeder it often takes months and some severe weather to find its flaws--so I'll update this review in a month or so.Cons:*First and foremost, I am not crazy about the way the base tilts down. The idea is that the squirrel will fall off (from its own weight tilting the base) but it appears to me that a squirrel could catch its paw in the feeding station opening if the base starts to tilt after he's on the feeder. I'm not completely sure that that's a possibility, but I was able to get my finger caught (gently) between the moving base and the stationery feeding tray. I certainly don't want to look out and see a squirrel hanging by its paw. Again, the risk may be pretty low, but the way this is designed, the feeding perches are attached to a collar (that has holes through which the birds feed off of an interior tray) and that's what moves. It's easier to understand once you have the feeder in front of you.*Also, I prefer a feeder that has a catch tray underneath to catch the spilled seed. Instead, this tray has openings in the base so that food that falls off of the internal feeding tray falls out through slots in the bottom of the feeder (again, much easier to see when you have the feed in front of you).  The problem with food falling on the ground is that it brings rats and mice. When there is a catch try, the food gets eaten by the birds.*The tube seems a bit too flexible to me. The way that you mount the lid, for example, is to squeeze it a bit and slide in two prongs on the lid (the lid, not the dome, they are two separate things). It seems to me like the prongs could have been a tiny bit longer to keep it attached more securely--and also, every time you grab the tube, you squeeze it and the lid can pop off. Not a major flaw, it's minor, but it's an issue. The Droll Yankee feeders have a lid that slides up and down, you don't have to remove it and it fits very securely. I'm not sure if the plastic tube on a Yankee feeder is thicker or not, they may be exactly the same.You might think that from the cons that I don't like this feeder, but that's not quite true. I am willing to keep it up for a while and see how it works, both in keeping squirrels away and in just feeding the birds. If I don't see squirrels hanging by their paws or find a lot of food on the ground, I'll be satisfied. As I said, I like the capacity and I think overall the feeder is made of quality materials. I just have some issues with design choices that had to be made in order to facilitate that tilting base. I will raise my review to four or five stars if the feeder proves itself. I really want to like this feeder partly because I like the capacity so much.OK, I said that I figured out how to keep squirrels off of your feeders and I have. I went to a bird feeding store and I bought a sort of kit that consists of a pole (plus a simple insert for putting the pole in the ground securely--it works beautifully) and a baffle that goes around the pole. Squirrels can only jump about 4' off the ground maximum--and I can verify that from years of playing with the height of the baffle. So if you place the baffle on the pole at 4' or so and IF there are no nearby trees or fences for them to jump from, they simply can't get up the pole. I have a three-pronged hanger at the top of the feeder and I have three feeders on it: sunflower, suet and thistle. It works: in five years, not a single squirrel has reached the promised land.I don't have this Perky-Pet feeder on that pole though because I want to see if it defeats the squirrels on its own. So I just hung it on a 4' pole (a shepherd's hook) so that the base of the feeder is within the squirrel's jumping range. It's only been out a few days and the squirrels haven't discovered it yet, but they will--and soon. I'll try to keep a video camera handy and I'll post a short video of my experiment if I catch a squirrel in action.I love squirrels, I find them very interesting--but I would much rather just watch birds without that extra havoc. I'll post an update shortly.",1378166400,2013-09-03

The 3rd leg kind of twirls on which is quite obvious once you start fiddling with it but the instructions have no words so the pictures are not as self-explaintory as I would have hoped in these 2 areas.My only complaints on this grill are the legs and the handle.

My call came in the middle of Hurricane Sandy when they were absolutely swamped with calls for generators. But Fred was extremely calm, polite and helpful and had my problem resolved and part on the way.  Not only that, he followed-up once tracking showed it had arrived to make sure I got and I was good to go.

4.0,"We have a fairly small front yard and no other grass, so we were able to mow it with half a charge. Some reviewers claim to have no problems doing a half-acre yard and others say they can't finish a 1/3rd-acre yard. If I had a half-acre yard, I would get a gas mower. I wouldn't pay $250+ for 2 batteries every 2-3 years. Also, stopping in the middle of mowing to change batteries sounds like a big nuisance.I don't think this mower has any overwhelming advantages over the latest gas mowers. The main reason we got this is so that we don't have to mess with checking and filling the gas tank, but IMO, that is about the only advantage.It does a good job of cutting and mulching. Anyone who is having problems with the mulching may not be setting the height up enough. It shows on the mower that a setting of 4+ inches is required for the mulching to work right.We checked under the mower when done cutting and there was no grass build-up at all under it.Negatives:It is not as quiet as I was expecting it to be, but it is much quieter than our old gas mower.Either the handle or the part it attaches to was bent so the left side of the handle does not fit flush, but it's close enough to work.It came with a tear in the foam around the handle.As others have said, the slowest speed setting is still as fast as we would want to go, so the faster speeds are wasted. B&D; should adjust this, but it still works for us. When turning to go back at the edge of a lawn, if you let go of the self-propel control, it can be hard to maneuver and if you don't let go, it wants to whip you around.The directions were very confusing. For example the self-propelled model has two ""bales"" (wires above and below the handle) - one to control the blade and one to control the wheels.

I am almost to my goal of being becoming 100% standardized on Black & Decker's 20 volt lithium battery powered tools.I strongly recommend Black and Decker's series of tools that use 20 volt lithium battery.  But be aware that there are three different 20 volt batteries. One to avoid if possible is the 22 Watt Hour battery.  Get the 30 Watt Hour battery that is almost the same price.  And there is the double sized Black & Decker LB2X4020-OPE battery for about 50% higher price.  But there is an advantage of having multiple 30 Watt Hour batteries.  You can be charging one while using another battery.  You have a choice of buying several tools without the battery for better economy.",1397865600,2014-04-19

4.0,"We really enjoy the free show right outside our kitchen windows where we have hung two hummingbird feeders. We have visitors from dawn to dusk, though they tend to go take a nap on really hot sunny days - perhaps the nectar gets too warm to suit them. It's so interesting to watch the different feeding strategies - some hummers hover and dive in for quick sips; others perch on the foot rest and guzzle. It is rare to see 2 or more birds at the feeder at the same time as depicted in the illustration, since they are quite territorial, but it does occasionally happen. The birds seem to have learned who refills the feeder. Several times when I've been in the backyard weeding or watering, a hummer will hover right in front of my face, maybe 2 feet away, and make eye contact. I'm sure he's saying ""hey lady, the feeding trough is empty!"" Sometimes they buzz right by my head when I'm sitting out there reading. As I said, they're always entertaining :)We have seen some bees on the yellow part of the flower, but not enough to be a nuisance. The major issue I have had with the feeder is the tendency to drip after you refill it. I always bring it indoors to clean it under hot running water, then refill with homemade nectar (4 parts water to 1 part sugar boiled briefly until the sugar dissolves). When I refill it in the kitchen sink and carry it outdoors I invariably dribble a little sugar water on the floor. Do you know how hard it is to clean up sticky sugar water from the floor? I should know by now that it would be better to refill it outdoors!Others have criticized the plastic parts, which won't last forever, but at the price, I don't mind having to replace it every few years. I had an all glass feeder a few years ago which was quite a pretty piece of art, but I gradually broke off all the flowers and perches, and it only lasted about a year...",1374969600,2013-07-28

4.0,"This brush cleaner works very well with water.  I cleaned my Weber gas grill grates which had melted cheese, glazes and rubs which included sugar caked onto the grates.  Within minutes the grates were cleaned very well as if they were new.  I set my grill to it's highest setting and when it reached 400 degrees I began scrubbing the grates with the water knob on all the way.  For tougher jobs, the description on Amazon indicates to loosen the resevoir knob to let air flow in to push more water out while cleaning.  So much steam was generated which helped with the ease of scrubbing.  As far as other reviwers writing that theirs broke after very few uses, I don't see how unless it was a defective item or these guys are literally standing on their grills and using their bodyweight to clean it.  There's no need for that much down force to clean the grates.  I'm 6'1 at 215lbs and mine hasn't broke or showed a sign of breaking after one year of continual use (I grilled every weekend from early May to late October and I also grilled on some wkds during the Winter months).  If you let the grill preheat high enough the bristles and the steam will do the work for you.The only downsides to this brush is that after some time (for me was about a year) the steel bristles began to fall off of the brush while scrubbing.  Although very hazardous, this is typical for grill brushes so that was expected.  Just be sure to inspect your grates after cleaning to remove any loose bristles or your future food will be served with a steel spike.  Another minor downside is the gunk that the steam and brush loosen up can splatter all over the front of the grill area and on yourself.  Be sure that you're wearing a barbecue apron or your clothing will get filthy.Aside from those minor downsides, this grill brush works very well and does the job.  I highly recommend.  I just purchased a new brush head and will update my review if I run into any issues replacing it.",1373241600,2013-07-08
4.0,"I'm not a big fan of Perky-Pet bird feeders.  They're usually cheaply made out of too much plastic and aren't squirrel-proof, even when advertised as such.  Not surprisingly, the Panorama is part plastic, has some cheaply made parts and is definitely not squirrel-proof.  What is surprising is how much the birds and I really like this feeder.  It has many redeeming features.The Panorama is made out of well-constructed metal.  The two chambers hold an ideal amount of seed, a total of 4.5 lbs--seeds move quickly, but don't require daily refilling.  Yes, the tube chamber is plastic, but it does a good job of keeping out bad weather and preventing moisture problems.  The circular trays that hold exposed seed have drain holes beneath them to further reduce seed spoilage.  So many feeders nowadays are tube style, but they typically have very few feeding ports or are surrounded by caged wires, only allowing little bird access.  This one offers two wide circular metal feeding rings.  How nice to see a large variety and number of birds feeding simultaneously.Perky-Pet needs to test their products in hard-core squirrel country.  Where there's a will, there's a way, and squirrels around here are experts at draining and destroying.  The cap on this feeder does offer a lock system of sorts, but it is flimsy.  Just a matter of time before I break the little plastic pieces off or the squirrels do.  There's nothing to stop squirrels from lazily wrapping themselves around a tray and gorging themselves either.  That's why I've located the Panorama off an old basketball hoop--no squirrel can reach it.  With a little care on my part, this feeder hopefully will last a long time.If you don't have squirrel problems, I highly recommend this universal feeder.  It does not selectively keep out any bird, is esthetically pleasing to look at and its cost is within every birder's budget.",1370304000,2013-06-04
5.0,"F.Y.I  A LOT OF THE BAD REVIEWS ARE ON THE OLDER MODEL SMOKER. THIS IS THE NEWER MODEL AND YOU CAN BUY AND REPLACE THE HEATING ELEMENT IF IT EVER BURNT OUT.this masterbuilt smoker works great for me even when using a extension cord. but if using one it be must be able to handle the power the smoker requires. I used a regular outdoor cord and it took my smoker forever to heat up. I ended up buying a (Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends,25-Feet) bought on amazon and smoker heated up quick & worked it the way it was meant to work. this smoker is very easy to use and puts out good smoke although it does not put out smoke with temps under 200F not sure if that's because I use wet chips I haven't tried using dry chips yet. I'm very happy with this smoker so far I've only smoked ribs & chicken and turned out very good. there has been a lot of reviews about getting parts for this smoker & dealing with Masterbuilt customer service. I haven't dealt with C/S so I don't know about that as far as finding parts I found a place on the internet called APPLIANCE FACTORY PARTS that sells parts for model# 20070106 & model# 200709010 also I did not buy this smoker from Amazon got mine at WM but thought I would write a review anyway and I payed the same price that amazon sells it for but it took 2 weeks to get it from them.6 MONTH UPDATE 11/23/12well after 6 months and 200+ hours of smoking time, this smoker still works great. I've smoked snacking sticks, summer sausage, pulled pork, chicken, ribs, Canadian bacon,turkey, and venison and all turned out great. I never had any problems with the heating element, digital timer, or any other part of this smoker. as far as smoking/cooking I've never set the temp higher then 225 F when smoking, after a few hours of smoke I'll drop the temp down to 200 to 210 F to finish cooking, and use a wireless digital meat thermometer. I've kept mine outside all summer/fall and haven't noticed any signs of rust or any other signs of damage but I have a good cover for it. but I'll keep in the garage/shed over the winter. the cover I bought for this smoker is the Veranda Square 30"" Smoker Cover for Price: $29.00 bought on amazon its a great cover. love this smoker. just remember keep it clean buy a water proof cover, if kept outside. if going to use a extension cord I recommend this one. Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends, 25-Feet. I will UPDATE in another 6 months.1 1/2 YEAR UPDATEwell after 1 1/2 years of use about 450+ hours this smoker still works great never had any problems at all with it. I did buy the cold smoker adapter for it and that works GREAT, I don't put chips in the main smoker anymore. the cold smoker adapter holds a lot more chips about three good handfuls and produces longer and better smoke then just using chips in the main smoker. you can run the main smoker and the cold smoker at the same time even when using a extension cord in fact I can run the main smoker, cold smoker and my Weber rotisserie at the same time without any problems. the extension I use is a (Yellow Jacket 2883 12/3 Heavy-Duty 15-Amp SJTW Contractor Extension Cord with Lighted Ends 25-Feet) and a ( yellow jacket 2' three plug adapter. again if you plan on keeping it outside make sure you buy a good waterproof cover the black masterbuilt cover is worthless. also I would not keep it outside in freezing weather the cold could damage the digital timer / temp gauge. I keep mine in the basement in the winter months when not in use and never had any smoke smells coming from it.",1337212800,2012-05-17
5.0,"Probably like a lot of folks, I used to own a different brand grill and often wondered ""What's the big deal about Weber?"" and assumed it was just marketing for some sort of adequate, but overpriced, grill.  Then years ago I replaced my old grill with a Weber Genesis....and I never looked back.  The quality was great.  So when the need arose for a portable grill, I didn't look much further than Weber.I actually have the Q1200 and the Q2000.I do not do a lot of camping or tailgating, but I like to have this available for the occasional ""picnic type"" BBQ, like on a short trip down the shore.I have also used it for a party at home, when I wanted to have some auxiliary grill space.  I find it extremely useful when I am grilling something that might cook faster than what's on my main grill, and/or takes up less space (hot dogs, grilled veggies, etc.).Someone who has an apartment, but maybe not a lot of patio or deck space might enjoy this type of grill as well.So, what's in the box?  The grill, already assembled, except for the handle!  Set up took less than 15 minutes, some of which was cutting open the box.Whereas my larger Weber grill has three straight burners which ruin across the length of the grill, both the Q1200 and Q2000 have a rectangular burner.  Lighting is a breeze, with your basic piezo spark starter, and heat distribution is very good.  You can adjust the heat, low, medium, and high, like full-size Webers, but since these have one burner, you need to reposition meat to sear it, etc. as opposed to lowering/raising, or turning off one burner.While portable, the Q2000 is still a decent size for cooking.  Fully open it's about 51"" wide (including the tables), about 26"" high and about 2 feet deep.  The cooking surface is about 280 square inches.The Q1200 is a little smaller at just under 41"" wide (again, with the tables extended), about 24 "" high, and 20 "" deep. The Q1200 has 189 square inches of cooking surface.  In cooking terms that's about 7 or 8 hamburger patties for the Q1200 versus 10 or 11 patties on the Q2000.  The Q2000 is 12,000 BTUs, while the Q1200 is 8,500 BTUs.The grill surface consists of two cast iron grills, which is a smaller, but similar design to Weber full-size grills.  They are porcelain enameled.You have to place the grill on a raised surface like a table, as it does not come with a raised stand.  The built in stand keeps it just a few inches off a surface.  Weber does sell an optional raised stand.  The built in stand also has two folding tables on it, which come in handy for keeping food, condiments, plates, etc. on them.The Q series grills are fueled by 14.1 or 16.4 ounce LP canisters.  Like a raised stand, you can buy an optional adapter so you can connect a full-size propane tank.I have seen other reviews which say the Q2000 does not have a grease drip tray.  Both my grills include one.  They have a removable metal drip pan.  My box also included one disposable aluminum tray.  I recommend these on any grill, as it makes it easy to throw these out and replace them, rather than clean the more permanent drip pan.On my wish list would be a built in thermometer for all Q series grills.  While I have meat thermometers (stand-alone and built into meat forks), I like a built-in one just to show me general heat ranges.  Some Q series grills have a thermometer (Q1200 & Q2200) built in (150 to 600 degrees).Overall, this is a great portable grill.  Whether your use is camping, tail-gating, at home, etc.  the Q Series grills are a great value.  Weber backs it with a 2 year overall warranty, as well as 5 years on the cookbox, grates, lid, burners and plastic surfaces.  Basically it's a 5 year warranty, but 2 years on paint, etc.",1391990400,2014-02-10
3.0,"I had high hopes for this product and tried it on vinyl and wood siding and a wood deck. My first disappointment was in the amount of effort it takes just to prepare your chosen surface prior to using the product. I had minimal foliage to be concerned with but if I had, the directions gave even more prep instructions for plants and flowers. In any case, For the vinyl and wood siding surfaces, I followed the instructions and used the Krud Kutter on half of each structure and plain water on the other half. While I did see a slight difference where the Krud Kutter was applied, it wasn't enough to make me want to use it again when the time came to clean my deck. By then, it just wasn't worth the effort for such minimal results. Granted, the sidings and deck probably haven't been properly cleaned in years so perhaps I was just expecting too much. But given the amount of prep work involved - like pre-wetting each surface - this would have to produce some amazing results for me to want to put that much extra effort into pressure cleaning with anything more than just plain water. Too bad since my cleaning skills really could use some help.....",1404172800,2014-07-01
5.0,I am very impressed with this unit!  I was able to start most of my seeds indoors this year and the ability to raise and lower the light easily to make sure you don't end up with spindly plants is great.  The light does not put out massive amounts of heat at all and is *incredibly* bright!  What amazing technology.  Highly recommend if you are a gardener who lives in an area with a short growing season.  The unit is extremely portable and lightweight.  It is also so simple to put together almost anyone could do it.  I prefer putting it on a table for easier access to plants and I also bought an inexpensive timer so I wouldn't have to remember to turn the unit on and off while working.  Great value.,1369267200,2013-05-23
5.0,"I like this weeder better than the ""Weed Popper"" I have been using.  It is light-weight, and does the job effectively if used properly.  With the lever to either the right or left side, center the tines over the center of the weed and push it into the ground.  When pushing on the lever put the foot close to the handle and push down.  It is important that the FOOT BE REMOVED at this point when you lean towards the lever, as you might break the handle.  Lean the handle towards the lever, then pull the weed out of the ground. Simple!  I like that it does not dig up big chuncks of lawn like my ""Weed Popper"" and it is much lighter than the Popper.  I won't say you will never bend to pick up another weed, but bending will be greatly diminished, which means you won't tire as quickly.

5.0,"I've owned the Char-Broil Patio Caddie for quite a few years and I am currently on my 2nd grill.  For those looking for a compact grill to use on a small patio or balcony, I believe that this is the best grill that you'll find.I'm not sure if the other reviews mention this or not, but this grill does accept a full-size propane cannister, so you can just swap it out at your local drug or hardware store when it's empty.  My grill did come with the smaller cannister, but I bought it quite awhile ago, so perhaps they no longer do.  If yours doesn't, it's no great loss, in my view, because once again, I've never used the smaller cannister.  Just get yourself a full-sized one and it will last a lot longer.The temperature gauge seems very accurate and the grill is quite durable. I figure that this grill should last you about 5-6 years, with regular use.

3.0,"First the pros - it's very a compact hose with a small footprint when dry/collapsed, the brass fittings seem to be sturdy and connected easily to my house and it's lightweight/easy to move around. For the cons - you need to follow the directions for it to work properly, the water pressure is disappointing and it is rather fragile when compared to a 'normal' hose. I've found it's better for watering plants and washing the car rather than for running a sprinkler or connecting to the pressure washer. Overall, I can see the promise in the idea but most of our water usage outside requires a bit more ooomph, so I see us sticking with a more traditional hose for now.",1400025600,2014-05-14

5.0,"This review is for the Havahart 1064 Large 2-door Easy Set Trap.  This trap is easy to setup, use, and release animals. It can be used as a single door trap or a double door trap.BUILD:  The dimensions of the trap are 12"" H x 36"" W x 10.5"" D.  The largest opening/gap in the steel cage mesh is 1"" x 1"".  THe door opening for the animals is 12"" H x 10.5"" W.  THe handle is sturdy. The steel wires of the pulleys are sheathed in plastic. The weight of the cage is about 2 lbs by itself. It's not heavy at all, but when there's an animal in the cage, it can become heavy.  Since there's a single handle, one person can carry it. Two people can carry it if you use wooden poles  in the front and back.  The top of the cage has a metal plate the size of 14"" x 10"" to protect you when your hand is on the handle.  When the doors are closed, the enclosed area is about 22"" W x 12"" H x 10.5"" D.You can set either one door open or both doors open. To set one door, remove the wire from the black loop/latch on the top of the cage.  To use both doors, put the wire around the loop/latch.  Since the trip plate is connected on only one side, that side requires less pressure for the trap doors to close.  The doors close quickly.  Once an animal is trapped, remove the wire from the black loop/latch so that only the door on the side of the latch will open to releasethe animal.This trap is sturdy, built well, easy to setup, and use. The intrsuctions are in English, French, and Spanish.  They are easy to understand with the text and diagrams.",1371600000,2013-06-19
5.0,"First off - my mole issue is very mild, maybe one or two tunnels a year, at most. I learned awhile back that MOLES EAT GRUBS.  As with any critter, eliminate the food source and reduce the problem.  So when I applied MILKY SPORE 3 times a year, for 2 years in a row as stated on the directions, my horrendous grub issue vanished and the moles with them.BUT, IF I still had a mole problem, this Deadset is an absolute Killing Machine.  My stepsister is selling her home so she needs a NOW solution, she doesn't have the luxury to wait for 2 years for the milky spore to work.  So we used this MOLE KILLING MACHINE where it's proven itself.  However, be aware that you will NOT want to use this Deadset Mole Killing Machine near pets or children.  The spikes are rather vicious - they WILL impale a human hand or a human foot or a dogs paw or a cats paw or that pet ferret that got loose, etc. Keep this in mind when deciding WHERE to locate the trap (er.. Killing Machine.)Meanwhile my neighbor's mole ventured a tunnel back into my yard.  Grabbed the Deadset, followed the directions to a T. Within short order...  Well, there's no more mole.. and my neighbor seems pleased his tunnels have suddenly stopped forming. Gee, I wonder why  ;-)The directions per the box:1. Water the lawn and active area (tunnels) thoroughly. A wet lawn keeps the moles food supply (grubs) close to the surface and makes it easy to place the mole trap in the ground.2. Locate the active tunnels. Poke a 1"" hole in the raised earth through to the tunnel. Wait 24 hours. If the hole is resealed the tunnel is active.3. Press down on the raised earth with your foot, depressing the tunnel roof. Press the trap into the softened ground, then use FOOT PEGS to firmly set the trap in place.4.

5.0,"A bird feeder is an act of kindness from one species to another. For all the birds do for us, and for all that we have done to them, the least we can do for our feathered friends in our own yards is to buy them some food in the worst of seasons and difficulties. Our homes are often sitting on the very land where trees, bushes, maybe a stream and more once provided for these birds. So give back some of what has been taken by purchasing and maintaining a birdfeeder or 2 or 3.We have had this bird feeder for 6 years and its still going strong. It is very well made and designed. The birds love it, the squirrels not so much as they have long given up hanging on the feeder trying to get food directly. The squirrels have been demoralized by the ingenious design where their weight drops the spring loaded cam, closing off the food access ports. The squirrels, somewhat sadly, now wait on the ground below for spillage from the birds above.You could buy a cheaper birdfeeder, a mistake I have made several times over the years. Learn from the mistakes of others. Cheap feeders are not squirrel proof or resistant and won't last.Squirrels cause 2 problems with feeders. The first you might have guessed; squirrels can eat so much seed as to double, triple, quadruple the cost of birdseed. Even a feeder for free, using so much seed wouldn't be a bargain!  But the 2nd issue which surprised me at the time, the squirrels will chew to pieces cheap feeders. Cheap feeders can look fantastic but the soft plastic parts such as the food reservoir made of flexible plastic can be hacked to pieces in minutes. So intent are squirrels that even my brome with a steel cap has intense chews marks on the edges, as the squirrels tried to chew their way to the food.A good bird feeder is an investment. It costs more but lasts a very long time and guaranteed, it saves money on seed, it keeps squirrels from becoming dependent on the feeder and their weight under control (lol)and is by far the better value by a very wide margin.Happily I can say Brome customer service is excellent. About a year ago the green perch ring broke as weathering caused this plastic part to brittle and snap. I sent an e-mail to Brome and they replied in a day, sending me a new ring free of charge by mail. On another occasion about 6 months ago, I took the feeder apart for cleaning and put it back together wrong. I called for service and they explained what I did wrong, a mistake probably nobody else would ever make -but as the Brome person explained the mistake, she mentioned I might have damaged the unit but not to worry, that they would replace the broken parts for free. As it turned out that wasn't necessary.In a small but most important way, you can pay back some of the damage that has been done to our feathered friends saving many of their lives, and you can do this easily from your own back yard with just a bird feeder or two, or three. Keep your feeder(s) filled and clean as your birds will really depend on them, and when the weather warms add a Hummingbird feeder or two. In the Spring your wintering birds will raise the next generation, all the while returning your kindness as they fill the sky with flight, your trees with song, while being with you and your family all the days of your life. Don't believe me? Just open your door and take a look and listen right now. :-)If you have kids consider making this their responsibility, a simple weekly chore and small life lesson on responsibility. I kind of think of it as one generation helping another, one species to another.""Opie had been caring for wild baby birds that lost their mother, and remarked on setting them free that sadly the cage was empty.

5.0,"Farms have mice. And this last year, the mice seem to have gotten much worse for some reason. I can't just set out some traps, we have to have a focused consistent approach.I loved the Tom Cat mouse killer stations. The bait is attractive to mice. I can see from the top how active mice have been at each station. Every station I have set has had significant action. The poison works quickly. I have actually had two mice die at the station. One thing to be aware of is the active ingredient kills mice but the mice don't have that dead mouse smell. I think this is a huge plus. But it can mean you are surprised with a dead mouse.I have liked all the Motomco Tomcat Mouse KIller products but this is my favorite. If you have an ongoing issue this is the best one to get. It is easy to refill the station and it's nice to have it on hand. This can kill up to 72 mice so it's definitely the size I will keep using.",1404345600,2014-07-03
4.0,"I have many faded plastic birdfeeders in the past. This was a novel design that I was happy to try out. From the start I was impressed. The package is very easy to open, no knives or scissors needed. I like the metallic brown/purplish finish. Not exactly bronze but a nice color that contrasts well with foliage.And this holds A LOT. I use black oil sunflower seeds anyway. The mesh size is such that birds can easily pull them out. Which means they can cling anywhere and get at seeds. It also means that the seeds fall out easily when filling it. And you cannot take the top all the way off so filling is awkward.Also if you see from the pictures and video each of the three levels has a top and bottom, except the top most. Unless you fill it up all the way the seeds get stuck at certain points. For instance I don't have it all the way filled up and the seeds in the second level are on the top level further from the perch.I like to set my birdfeeder and forget it. So unless you like refilling it more often the multiple layers won't get used. But even half full like I have it now, birds get at the seeds in many different ways, perch, clinging, and it looks nice even half full.But aside from the filling issue this is very nice. Just BE SURE to fill it outside and preferably in an area where birds will eat seeds on the ground. Another review had a good idea. Use some sort of funnel or pitcher when filling it. And really the trade-off of messy filling and some falling out is also its good advantage, birds can get at seeds anywhere.",1366934400,2013-04-26

5.0,As we had just move into our new home; we needed something to cook with outside.  We purchased a charcoal grill which lasted a little over a year.  We have a nice large cooking unfinished patio; so I decided that a natural gas grill was the only way to go.  It is so nice not to run out of gas in the middle of a big cookout or the mess of disposing of the remains of a charcoal ashes.  It takes about 10 minutes to preheat and after that the fun begins.  We use a Weber rotisserie and several other small accessories.  The smoke box we use is on the small side because we do not like a heavy smoke flavor.  Cleanup is a breeze and takes about 6 to 10 minutes.  As we live in Florida we keep the grills oiled with Weber oil that also prevents meat from sticking to the grill.  A minor tip is always wrap sweet potatoes in foil.  My DGD failed to do so and it took about 15 minutes to clean her mess up.Getting the gas connected from the house to the outside of the patio was my biggest problem because of my grill location.  I did all the digging and the gas man install the pipe and inspected all of the connections.We have had several cookouts as I like to use MY grill.  It is very easy to adjust the menu and items selected for as many come to eat.  My favorite is a large beef roast (6 to 8 pounds) with grilled vegetables.  The meat is cooked to everyone's liking from rare to well done as you do the slicing.,1344384000,2012-08-08

Took me about 30 minutes for the job and everything worked fine after that.  The grill is back to cooking how I first got it six years ago.",1342051200,2012-07-12

5.0,"This product would rate 5 stars on cuteness alone!  since we are nearly past time to order and plant, I wanted to do this review in real time.June 1st, 2013I purchased 2 raised cedar beds (locally, under $50 each) and filled them with Miracle-Gro Potting soil. I added a center container to each bed to give the beds some height interest.  I planned out my garden by looking at the space requirements for each seed pod and using my basic knowledge of mature plant height.  The estimated mature height is one bit of information Miracle- Gro should add to their literature as many first time growers might not realize certain plants may block sunlight.  My spaces to work with were two 4x4's which it just about right, albeit a little crowded.  The area I chose has full sun 10/11am thru 2/4pm.  My main pest concerns are slugs and ants.June 2nd, 2013Planting day!  The basil was planted in the two containers, however with larger containers you might be able to double up with the cilantro or dill.  The cucumber, which needs 48"", I planted to one side of the raised bed.  My thought is to train the plant to grow the length of the rest of the raised bed.  Since both tomatoes take up large space, I put these in with the cucumber.  Staking should be simple because I don't have to worry about the small veggies.I put the remaining seed pods in my second bed, arranged by spacing size and estimated height and trailing size.  Staking will be more difficult if it becomes necessary.Hint: before you rip the top off your seed pods, lay them all out in the beds and rework your spacing if needed. When finalized, take a picture and make a detailed map of what plant is where.  Mark north on your map....but then, I'm a map person....the point is know what you planted where.  I ripped the tops carefully as some seeds were visible, planted the pods, and watered.Updates to come....stay tuned.  Sprouts should be up in 5 - 10 days!June 7th, 2013Torrential rain, but I saw a few 5mm sprouts!  The cucumber and one of the lettuces were first out of the gate!June 19th, 2013I have never had such a rainy June!  All the plants are up; the last one to break thru was the pepper plant.  Some are still very small, like the dill, lettuces, and the basil.  Hopefully a few days of dryness and sunshine will promote rapid growth.I culled the plants as recommended, when they reached 2"".  Nearly every seed sprouted.  I did not edit the cucumber or the sweet pea down to a single plant as I have room for both to grow.  I will see whether or not that was a foolish choose later in the growing season.",1370131200,2013-06-02

That is a very nice feature.  However, the hook is not easily found as it is not inside the glass container but into the bottom of the unit.  You have to open the bottom of the unit by unscrewing the base from the bottom to get the hook out.  Strange place to store a useful part of the unit.

2.0,"I really wanted this product to work because I hate gasoline powered lawn mowers. But sadly, the unit I received just didn't have what it takes to mow St. Augustine grass.  It just bogged down even when cutting half a strip of grass.  I finally raised the lawn mower cutting height to the point it wouldn't bog down and it just skimmed over the top of the grass spewing grass out the sides of the lawn mower making a big mess.  Obviously I charged the battery a full day before I even attempted to mow the grass. I followed all the instructions to the letter. I was so disappointed I actually shipped it back to Amazon for a refund.I am a major purchaser on Amazon and this is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon in the entire five or more years I have been buying from Amazon. I am an Amazon Vine member. I read so many reviews on battery powered lawn mowers before I made this purchase because I was so worried it would be underpowered. And my concerns were validated. I don't understand why my lawn mower didn't perform.  Maybe the battery was weak or wouldn't charge properly, but it certainly seemed ok.  I'm sure I'll get a lot of rebuttal comments because I gave this lawn mower a low rating. But I will state up front that I have credentials and I am no dummy.So I broke down and purchased a gasoline powered lawn mower here on Amazon for about the same price and naturally it works great.

4.0,"Summary: Damaged during shipping, but great customer service comeback.Details:This storage bench is a very sturdy and well engineered product. The parts are all sturdy and high quality, with nice finish and fit. Clear instructions, and a wonderful piece for my garage and all the boots and shoes that we don't want coming into the house. The one negative issue is that the unit came damaged, as apparently a good many of them do according to other reviewers. I have posted some of the damage photos on this product page. It's strange because the part that was damaged was the metal base. It is in the middle of the box the unit comes in (BTW, you have to assemble the bench, which is no big deal at all). The box was totally fine. The internal packing material seemed OK, but the base was dented. I'm no packaging engineer, but apparently someone that works there isn't either. I think they need to pad the base better and somehow keep the heavy laminated bamboo top from crushing it during shipping. Like I said above, the external box looked fine, so I didn't gig the shipper. I think that somehow the internal load shifted and dented the base, even though it is not obvious to me how this happened.One other damaged piece was the top, but since it was minor, and the damage was in a back corner, I didn't bother. If you are more picky, you will want to make sure you go over this carefully upon receipt.The good news is that I called the GGW help number and it was immediately answered by a nice lady in the midwest who was able to help me. She quickly figured out which part I needed and had it shipped out to be received within a week. Of course, I need to figure out how to get rid of a five foot piece of 18 gauge formed sheet steel while paying attention to the environment ...After discussing the scarred top, I decided to just let it go as above because it would have required getting Amazon to ship a whole extra unit. For some reason, they can ship all the parts as repair items other than the top. In any case, it occurred to me that the next set would just as likely be damaged if I ordered the whole thing, so I thought there was less risk in shipping just the one part. It turns out I was right and the individual base that shipped as a replacement was flawless.Conclusion:Nice bench. Works great once all the parts are there. Don't expect the first one to arrive perfectly so give some extra time to make fixes with the cooperation of the wonderful GGW service crew. This means you also need to inpect it immediately upon arrival. Don't let one of these sit around waiting for that spare time to do the assembly - just do it now so you don't blow your parts warranty period, or your Amazon return time. I took off one star for this imperfect shipping. If all had been well out of box, I would give it a five.",1380153600,2013-09-26

4.0,"We've had Weber grills for a lifetime it seems. So I'm used to the standard grill that comes from the big box stores. After assembling and using it for awhile, there are some great strengths and a couple of weaknesses.Assembly was pretty easy although it was a little difficult getting one of the base parts to line up. A little strong arming and it sat in place long enough for me to get the screws in. In the end, there were some chains that were supposed to have something to do with the ignition and another one for the lid but no only did I not have an extra screw to attach it (as was implied in the directions) but I still couldn't see a purpose in them. The directions were sadly lacking here.The appearance is really neat. I really like the accessibility of the tank using the hinged front door panel. This allows us to turn the gas off at the tank for every use. Our Weber has the tank in the back with a grill front that makes it almost impossible to reach the tank knob. The lid and the circular grill base do not line up completely. I'm assuming this is because they are a thinner metal and it is pretty easy to make a domed shape slightly off. But I can keep the lid on without any problems, it is just a little off in alignment. The actual grill is supposed to have a marking on it to show which side faces down but I searched and searched and found no marking so I went with instinct on placement.It is pretty easy to move around but the wheels are mediocre and I didn't realize until after I put them on that there are two that specifically belong on the back and I had them mixed up. And that was a mistake on my part, they were indicated in the directions once I went back and read it again. I guess I was just assuming that wheels were wheels and they all looked the same at first glance.I had no trouble with ignition although it helps if I blow slightly at the gas towards the ignition. There are two burners (you can use one or both). It heats up quickly according to the temperature gauge on the lid. Mine definitely got to well over 500 and I think was 600 one time.What I really liked was how evenly it cooked our meat. We've cooked London broil, pork tenderloin and hamburgers. All seem to be a little more moist and nicely cooked. You can get a char on the outside but even though it is really hot, it seems to do more of a bake to the inside. I really liked how our food turned out and it was enough of a difference to notice.So I like how it cooks. I like the large grease pan although there is nothing disposable about it, it needs to be wiped/washed out. It does collect rain water but so does my Weber, even with a cover on - not sure how though.I like the look of this and the ease of use. I'm sure I will need even more time to make this work even more to my benefit.

The only thing is where I want to put it to protect a couple of apple trees I'm trying to espalier against a fence is a place I often walk myself and I then can get sprayed instead of the deer. It does seem to discourage the deer but I need it in many places.  I will try moving it around, easy to do as it's so light, and see how long the effects last from the last time the deer were sprayed.

Curious to see if the Victor mouse trap wasn't getting anything because of its more complicated entry point for the mice, I put both traps in the cupboard, side by side.  I used peanut butter in both the Rat Zapper (I put a dab of it in a bottle cap and slid it to the back of the trap) and this Victor mouse trap.  Over the next 6-7 weeks, 2 mice went into the Rat Zapper and were killed by it, and Victor mouse trap got nothing.It's a bit hard to review this Victor trap because the mice are an unpredictable variable.  I guess the best I can say is this Victor trap didn't have any false positive readings, indicating a dead mouse that really wasn't there, and the peanut butter didn't get stolen by the mice.  However, mice simply didn't enter the trap.  The Rat Zapper is a straight roomy tunnel for the mice to enter, while mice in the Victor trap have to go up narrow stairs to enter the trap.  Perhaps they find the Victor trap a bit more intimidating?  (Claustrophobic mice?)  It's hard to say.  If I ever get any mice in this Victor trap, I'll be sure to update this review.",1321488000,2011-11-17

5.0,"At first I didn't like this Corona pruner because it didn't seem to cut well.  Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide, and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces.",1370131200,2013-06-02
5.0,"As subversive as it may sound, I've never looked forward to holiday feast featuring turkey.  The birds never cook evenly with parts overly dry and other parts greasy.  And this happens despite basting, changing temperature, brining, tenting with foil.  Friends boasted about the great results they got with their outdoor turkey friers but here in New York, it gets cold outside.  I was also dissuaded by the hellish tales of houses burning down and propane gas explosions.  So after infomercial indoctrination and a gold box special, I purchased this indoor fryer.Easy to set up, it uses only two to three gallons of oil. We cooked a ten pound turkey(must be completely thawed) in forty minutes.  It was a gorgeous --golden brown and could have graced the cover of a magazine.  But most amazing of all was the juciness.  The skin was crisp but the meat cooked to mouth watering perfection.  Since then I have fried chicken, turkey and even prime rib roast, with the same succulent result.Draining the oil is easy.  There is a valve and an attachable spout that makes emptying a snap. The unit is compact and can be stored on a countertop.I recomend this fryer.

3.0,"Only the best designed HVAC systems provide a good flow of conditioned air to the rooms that need it the most.This device allows a retrofit when you have access to the ducts that have an exposed 6 inch diameter round duct.Mrs. Gearhead thinks it a little noisey, but I did not find it objectionable.There are a few changes I would make to the design. The 6 foot ac cord required that I install an electrical circuit to feed power to the elecric motor in this ""booster"". And then the there is the problem of activating the motor only when it was needed. To automate this, you need a relay to attach to the furnace blower motor so that this booster only runs when the blower is moving air. An experienced HVAC installer can do this, but then he could also trim the other ducts so theis auxilliary booster is not needed.So, it is no silver bullet to the average homeowner.",1384128000,2013-11-11
4.0,"This feeder is HEAVY. That translates to sturdy. No more little squrriel teeth mangling up the finish and function. Three small feeding slots are located on the front of the feeder. the perch, where the birds sit themselves to dinner, is spring operated. It stays open until something heavier than a bird grabs it. This would be the squrriels. the perch pivots downward, closing the feeding slots. The spring is adjustable, so depending on the size of the squrriels in your neighborhood, it can  be adjusted to thwart the little furball from raiding the seed bin. However, they may be able to hang from the roof of the feeder and reach some tasty morsels, but not a lot of seeds are accessible from the top through the slots. We use a variety of seeds, including sunflower seeds, and haven't found one that won't go through the slot from the supply bin.this is all metal, except for the windows, which are mounted into the feeder walls and serve as supply indicators. the top opens with the twist of the windvane. This is where you fill the feeder. It is a twisting affair to close and open the feeder, I don't see how squrriels have the strength to open it, so that will end the pop-the-top burglars. It has a heavy handle to hang it with, or there's the pole/base mount that comes with it if you want to place it on the top of a pole. It's built to last.",1362009600,2013-02-28
4.0,"If you're short, or even if you're not, trimming tall hedges can be a pain, because you have to get up and down off the ladder and re-position it every few minutes of work. The handles on these shears extend another foot and a half to keep you on solid ground and OFF the ladder.This is also helpful if you're gardening from a wheelchair or in a seated position.Now, a caveat - this pair of hedgers is for solving a very specific problem. These do not cut through thick branches or ornamental grasses easily like the Fiskars Powergear Hedgers I use in other situations. Nor are they the most lightweight hedger around.I ONLY recommend these for hedging leafy growth that is a little taller than you can ordinarily manage - for that, they do an excellent job and mine have lasted many years doing just that.

4.0,"This is quite an interesting contraption. It's stated that batteries should last up to 120 kills, and the storage tray holds up to ten mice at a time. It should still be checked each day unless you want to run the risk of pulling out a tray full of maggots. The trap is fairly compact in a smart design.Though targeted for indoor use only, I think that's just Victor's way of making sure people don't set it out to get rained on or to be blasted by the sprinklers. It's also to be kept out of barns so as not to raze it by flame and not used anywhere that flammable gasses may linger - good advice to follow. I might cheat and use it outside, though.There are placement considerations to account for when using the Victor Multi-kill. Because the stairways are open like a cutaway section similar to the tunnels of an ant farm, I believe it's important to get the backside flush against a wall so rodents aren't tempted to squeeze through the backside as a shortcut. This isn't easy to do with moldings keeping the trap away from the wall and with cabinets and counters leaving a cavernous recess. Either situation can be countered, such as by using a cardboard wedge for the moldings situation or by using a board to fill in the recess underneath counters, but it's something one does have to improvise, nonetheless.I feel a better design for the battery compartment would have been to have arranged the batteries to put the negative contact springs on the latch side of the door as opposed to the hinge side, because when the door gets closed the springs tend toward wanting to fold over sideways.As far as usability goes, it's as simple as it can be. It's easy to bait and easy to clear out with everything as accessible as it is. If you're a gadget lover, this mousetrap is sure to please. When I hear this thing prepare the charge, it arouses a bit of excitement, akin to that a fisherman gets after casting a lure into the water.Within the first week, I caught three mice in traditional snap traps and only one in the Multi-Kill. I would imagine it depends on where the mice want to go. The green light was flashing and sure enough there was a hit.  I am certainly glad to see that mice do find their way into the Multi-Kill trap. I didn't get to hear the zap, so I'm not sure if it's silent or if I was away at the time.This mousetrap is neat. Although the cost is a factor, it might be justified by the problem you're experiencing with mice (especially if they're never-ending, as might be the case in rural settings), your desire not to mess with setting up traditional traps and your concern for pets' safety - all valid reasons to give the electronic mousetrap a go. I still use the wooden traps because they fit into places this one does not, but I am still quite impressed by the Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mousetrap.",1313798400,2011-08-20

5.0,"I spend a lot of time in the prairie and in heavily wooded areas watching birds and also as a forest preserve volunteer. Mosquitoes and ticks are horrible when the weather gets warm and rainy. I treat my clothing with Permethrin, but on any exposed skin I use bug spray. I dislike the smell and the greasy residue which results in me not using enough of it and still getting a few mosquito bites. I was happy to try the Cutter backwoods version (I had been using a different brand).I have used the Cutter&#8217;s on several four-hour hikes and have not had any mosquito bites or picked up any ticks. There were a lot of mosquitoes and bugs flying around but none landed on me. Just to be sure this wasn&#8217;t a fluke, I used the other brand (a non-deep woods version with a lesser amount of deet) and after less than an hour had two itchy mosquito bites.I have sensitive skin so am always worried that a new-to-me product will cause irritation, but I was fine I had no skin reactions using the Cutter Backwoods formula (although I do wash off the spray as soon as I get home).The Cutter spray proved to be a superior product. In addition to keeping away the bugs, it&#8217;s pleasant to use. It goes on dry and has a mild scent. The nozzle produces a steady, even spray and doesn&#8217;t leak.

4.0,"While this product has already helped out a lot in getting rid of a lot of the stray cats in my area along with what turned out to be a couple rabid other animals there is one aspect that I would like have had come with this product. Another solid panel to protect my leg ( I had one cat scratch my leg I was putting it in the back of the truck to take to the local shelter. It does however have a rather large panel around the handle that you pick it up from. which is great for protecting the all important hand...Since then I have been doing what I can to hold the cage out from me but some of these animals are not exactly light that I end up finding in the cage. I honestly don't know how some of them have fit in there or even willingly gone in something so small compared to them.Overall this product has proven quite useful in getting all these crazy stray cats that like to fight in the neighborhood in the middle of the night and keep me and my neighbors awake at random hours. I think I have now taken 20+ cats out of the area as a result and that's only in a couple months of only putting the trap out about 30 times, the other 10 times I got some other critters, 2 of which were rabid (confirmed by animal control).Build quality is pretty good but I wouldn't mind a little more sturdiness to it but it still does the job rather well. I have found that a simple cat food works well for attracting all kind of critters.If you are looking to trap something and keep it alive at the same time as having something to transport it in then this is a good choice.

5.0,"And, boy do we have ants :(  Those little buggers that bite and judging by the way they scarf down cat food, I would hate to trip and fall in their wake!Sometimes I think our house and the ones around us were built on a giant anthill because they are always around.  There are no basements either; houses are built on slabs so they have to work at getting in and work they do.  Last month I had 3 invasions in my bathroom and before caulking around the baseboard and tub again, we put down TERRO liquid bait trapsTERRO PreFilled Liquid Ant Killer II Baits  6 Pack  T300.  They do the job, but watching hundreds of ants going to and from into the wall can be a bit disconcerting.  You just have to remember they are eating the bait and taking it back to the nest where they and the others, including the queen, will die. Leave the trap down until no more ants are seen, about 2 days, depending on the size of the colony.  That's for inside the house........there are also larger TERRO liquid ant baits for outside.Two days ago I walked into the back yard and in seconds my slippers and feet were covered with biting ants.  I mean covered, as in some of the old horror movies where the ground is moving with them. There was a Don Johnson movie, A Boy and His Dog, in the 70's about ants taking over the world - looking at my feet I had a flashback of that movie!Our house is up against and above a large grassy park and I don't know if they were migrating there - if ants migrate - or if they were from the house next door that is now vacant, but I have never seen anything like it.We got the TERRO T3400 and sprayed the back and side of the house and all around the ground where they were.  We then got theTERRO 600 1-Pound Ant Killer Dustand put it on windowsills and at the base of the house.  Then the sprinklers came on and we knew the ants would go underground.Late that afternoon we didn't see any ants and the next morning the same thing.  A few here and there, but the moving horde was gone.  They might have gone underground and are planning a new assault on the backyard or they have moved on with the help of the water and the TERRO products.I do know that the TERRO T3400 killed them on contact when sprayed directly on them. It is easy to use and the sprayer has a wide area.We always have the dry and wet cat food on the back patio up on a table (we feed stray/feral cats who pass by) and keep the ground under and around the table sprayed as a preventative measure.All I know is that TERRO products will continue to be a permanent part of our ant control.Based on our experience, I would recommend the TERRO T3400 Insect Killer.",1373500800,2013-07-11

All the photos highlight that new-copper shine, but after one fire, the shine quickly fades, inside and out.  Not a big deal, but if you are spending extra because copper looks so pretty, you might be disappointed.Overall, I really like the pit, and don't mind the discoloration.  The included grate, and the holes in the bottom of the pit, assist with airflow...this will keep your fire burning longer without having to fuss too much with the wood.  I did notice that after just one use, the metal on the grate itself had warped a bit...not a huge surprise, I guess, but I wonder what it will look like at the end of summer.One other thing: I really appreciate the provided tool for removing the lid.  I've never had a fire pit before, and maybe all pits come with such a tool, but without it I would need to keep protective gloves nearby for removing the lid during a fire.In summary: If it's important for you to have copper, this is a fine fire pit, but you may need to do some work to keep it looking as nice as it did when you bought it.",1402531200,2014-06-12

4.0,"We have a very large yard (close to two-acre lot) and use a riding mower for most of the cutting and weed whacker for the edging, and we even have a push mower, but there are still areas that aren't easily taken care of by those other implements--hard to get areas like steep ditches and other nooks and crannies.There is some assembly required on this mower, but my husband had this put together and up and running in under 15 minutes. The blades were sharp and cut standard height grass/weeds well on a single pass. Taller weeds--probably close to 6"" high in the corners--didn't respond as well, with the push mower basally just pushing them over, but we've had this problem with the power mower as well. (These prairie weeds are resilient.)My husband was initially resistant to trying the push mower, having experienced several old-fashioned models in his childhood, but was pretty impressed with how well it worked, and how easily these pushed. And while he didn't want to do it for very long (a couple pushes and he was done), even my five year old could operate it. I rarely mow but tried it and was impressed at how smoothly it pushes, and the quiet was very nice and relaxing. That being said, it's still obviously more physically intensive, especially after a while, than a power mower, but I can definitely see how it would be good exercise. :)While I certainly couldn't imagine doing a huge area with this on a regular basis, I think it would be great for small yards or those hard to reach patches power mowers just aren't made for. My husband especially loved this around trees, where the weed wacker can't be used because it damages the tree itself (essentially, killing it by cutting the outer bark). This cut quite close to the base, was easy to maneuver (this has a MUCH tighter turning radius than any power mower) and took care of the crab grass that thrives at the base.The only reason I rated this four-stars instead of five was that, when pushing through tough weeds like our yard tends to get (we have fields on either side of the roads opposite our house so we get a lot of weeds no matter how hard we try), it can be ineffective and, when it does work, has to be cleaned out out frequently which is a little scary given the sharp blades, even when using gloves.",1335225600,2012-04-24

4.0,"The Oregon MAX Trimmer/Edger  is my second foray into the world of battery-powered trimmers.  I bought a Core CGT400 trimmer last summer and I ended up returning it due to a faulty trim head.  The Core worked pretty well but didn't have power to match a gas powered trimmer.  The Oregon MAX falls into the same category; it works well, but the thick St. Augustine grass in Texas does cause you to have to walk slowly and sometimes you have to go back over the same area twice.PROs-------------------+ light and well balanced+ battery lasts a long time and holds its charge when stored+ no cords and no smelly gas+ terrific edging guide featureCONs-------------------- underpowered compared to a gas trimmer- small cut area compared to other trimmers I've usedThe unit only has 4"" of exposed trim line (though it is double-sided from the trim head).  This is 2"" less than my Honda gas trimmer and 1"" less than the Core CGT400.  I assume the cutting area is reduced so that the motor doesn't get bogged down due to insufficient of power.  The problem with this design compromise is that it slows you down because the cutting area isn't as large as other trimmers.Fortunately, the slower trimming is tolerable because the Oregon MAX is lightweight and the battery lasts a really long time.  I trimmed/edged 800 linear feet of curb and fence of my corner lot and the power held steady the entire time.  The battery has an LED indicator that tells you how much charge remains.  After 800 feet of cutting, the 4Ah battery indicated that it was half charged.  Impressive!The Oregon MAX is well balanced and easy to maneuver.  Being quite light, and having a long reach, it doesn't tire you out during long jobs.  The bump head works well and advances string readily without kinking.  It is a dual-line model which allows you to do more cutting for the same RPMs.The most outstanding feature of this trimmer is the edging guide.  A metal guide swings down and you simply pull the trigger to full RPMs and slide this guide along your curb and you will get the straightest, most perfect, edging I've ever seen from a hand-held trimmer.  It is amazing and it's a feature I wish every trimmer had.  Even edging the thick St. Augustine grass worked pretty well.  The relatively thin line did break off a bit often, but I plan on installing thicker line in the future.The handle was very easy to adjust to a position that worked for either edging or trimming.  Once I got it ""just right"", I could go back and forth between trimming and edging without pause.One thing I noticed while edging is that the debris guard is not that helpful.  The edger threw up a cloud of dust and I was covered in dirt by the time I was done.The battery uses lithium ion technology and holds its charge between uses.  That is really handy as you can charge it and then let it sit without worrying that it will be dead the next time need it.The unit is very well built and seems like it will last a long time.If you live in a part of the country with ""normal"" grass, the Oregon MAX will have plenty of power to quickly handle big trimming and edging jobs.  With rugged St. Augustine ""grass"" (really a vine) in Texas, the Oregon MAX is a bit out-classed.  That said, if you want something light and cord-free, I definitely recommend the Oregon MAX.  And the edging feature is pretty darn cool.",1398470400,2014-04-26

5.0,"After watching a show on PBS about using a push reel mower and leaving the clippings to fertilize the grass, we decided to give it a go. We have a gas rotary mower and I'm forever frustrated with it. You have to fill it every time you use it because the gas slowly evaporates over time. And every time you use it, the so called spill proof gas can leaks gas everywhere when you remove the nozzle from inside.So, to make a long story short we got out Fiskar StaySharp mower. It came in a smallish nicely packed box with a small instruction manual that is well laid out and explains in plain English with accompanying diagrams the simple assembly procedure. There aren't many parts and only 4 bolts. You will have to have a couple of wrenches or sockets to do up the bolts. I think it uses an 11mm and an 18mm bolts. Once assembled I gave it a go straightaway. I've used two other reel push mowers, one fancy one handed down from a friend with a collector box and a cheap one in the $70 price range. To be honest I wasn't really expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.The mower is easy to push and cuts very well. I cut a two week old lawn at the lowest setting and had no problems whatsoever. The weight when pushing was equivalent to my regular gas mower and cut much cleaner because it does cut the grass more like scissors rather than tear the grass the way the rotary type mower tends to.My first go with this mower I only had one problem and that is more my fault. The rotary mower actually cuts right up to the wheels where the reel/cylinder mower cuts to about  inch inside the wheels so my first mow I left a couple of thin strips of uncut grass which I didn't notice till the next day when the sun was casting a shadow at a long angle. So you do have to overlap your mowing path by an extra couple of inches more than you might be accustomed to. The other thing is that we had some long stiff stalks in the lawn which were over 8 inches tall. These were pushed over rather than cut and were standing up the next morning. The  manual says it won't cut grass taller than 6 inches. So if your lawn is neglected and over that length you will have to find an alternative.The one other thing is that on long grass, it's best to overshoot slightly so when you turn around you have a couple of feet to get momentum and have those blades up to speed. The brisker you walk the more efficient the mower operates.I did  both our lawns about 4000 square feet in 80 degree Fahrenheit weather and didn't feel any worse for wear than if I had used my gas mower. In many ways it was nice not to have a noisy engine roaring away. I can also keep my dogs in the back yard when mowing because they are not agitated by the more quiet mower and the eldest pug no longer wants to dig where the blades are. I always had to keep both of them indoors in the past where they would make one heck of a racket at the patio doors. So peace and quiet and a nice clean cut. If the blades stay sharp as the name implies and  spiel advertises I think I will be sticking with this mower in the future.",1335571200,2012-04-28
5.0,"The most impressive -and wholly unforeseen - factor that impressed me about this chaise cover was its ability to withstand a moderate hailstorm without getting any rips or tears. The hail, which started when we were outside, was somewhere between pea-sized and slightly larger. It was large enough to be painful and left some welts. But the chaise cover came through just fine. I can't say that about others we've had - this is our third so far, all from different manufacturers. None lasted more than a season.I'll update this review after we have a season of severe weather, snow, ice, etc. But based on results so far, I'm very hopeful this will do well.There are some features I especially like about this cover:It is easy to use and can fit a range of chaise lengths. Ours is shorter than the suggested maximum of 66"" and at first we thought the cover would be too baggy. But the hem cord is adjustable, easily allowing us to get a snug fit. Also there are click and snap belts for each leg. No trouble getting those in place. The ideal chaise for this cover would probably be a bit longer. But even on our smaller chaise, this works fine.All in all, it took less than 5 minutes to get this set in place and then adjusted on our chaise and some of that was time removing the cover from the box and packaging. The fabric is nice and thick and, as noted above, didn't rip or tear during a hailstorm, one in which even a couple of roof shingles fell off (and yes, we maintain our roof). In short, this isn't some thin plastic like the type you'd find on inferior covers. It is meant to protect outdoor furniture -and so far it does that very, very well.Since the hailstorm, there have also been quite a few of those sudden and intense summer storms, complete with high winds and drenching rain. Any stains or residue from sticks, dirt, or leaves which fell on the chaise cover were easily wiped up.The padded handles are a very nice touch, making the cover easy to grip and move, both while on the chaise and when getting ready to store it.",1375315200,2013-08-01
4.0,"I put this together by myself, but man did I mess up on the first try.  Fortunately, the metal ring was fairly forgiving.  There are a couple slight creases where I applied pressure to connect the legs because I didn't realize they were connected on the inside (lesson learned - refer to picture on box first).The instructions were not at all clear regarding leg placement. I believe the box picture is likely all you need after a glance at the instructions to read that the small ring is attached to the legs first.  There were screws of two different sizes and no explanation why. And there were leftover screws that led me to think I'd done something wrong. I finally just determined that things fit and it was sturdy, so good enough.A helpful note in the direction states to empty the fire pit after use (I know, duh) and then invert the screen to put the cover on.  This may help cover more of the legs and avoid some of the rusting issues mentioned in other reviews.  I think I'll just plan on buying a larger cover eventually, one that will cover the legs better.The bowl is quite heavy and larger than I anticipated.  I like the looks of it very much.",1365379200,2013-04-08
4.0,"Last year we purchased an electric weed whacker with an extension cord. Unlimited power, but also unlimited whining from my husband when he constantly got the cord tangled around trees. Over Christmas, our extra long extension cord was damaged (hmmm, could it have been deliberate?). We decided, with 1/3 acre to try this. As others have mentioned, the battery life isn't as long as I'd like it to be, but with two, it gets the job done.It was a bit awkward assembling, mostly getting the bottom to clip in tightly.We actually purchased the fast charge battery charger to go with this (charges the battery in an hour) and the batteries are interchangeable with other Black and Decker lawn products, so this is worth it to us.

4.0,"Egg white, Capsaicin, and Garlic are 5% of the product, who knows what else...There are no indications that the product is non-toxic but I expect it is. There are only warning about irritation if it gets in your eyes. This is expected as Capsaicin is the hot in a hot pepper.I would like to see more information about how and where the product is safe. It should be safe around birds, but is it?As packaged the primary recommend use is to protect seedlings from getting nibbled, and it seems to work well in that regard.I would like to use it around my bird feeders to fend off the squirrels there as well.The battery powered sprayer is a great addition to this type of product. Powered by 4 AA batteries, it isn't a power sprayer and your old fashioned pump sprayer will beat it easily. However for quick spot applications the battery power is sufficient to do the job. The spray itself is a good balance between too light of a mist and a washout dripping product. A couple seconds on each plant was enough to get good coverage and the large capacity jug will easily last the season.",1345680000,2012-08-23

4.0,"Havahart Deer Off is among many egg and garlic based repellents.  I've used lots of brands, and found most to be effective if used conscientiously.  Even though Deer Off says theirs is a weather resistant formula, I still follow a schedule of retreating after every rain or about once a month.  Deer Off suggests every two to three months, but who wants to test those limits?I like Deer Off's concentrated form more than its ready-to-use counterpart.  Making up smaller batches better suits my needs, and the sprayer does not clog using the diluted concentrated formula.  I will never buy Deer Off ready-to-use again.  Even though the sprayer was religiously cleaned after each application, it still clogged, rendering a big container useless.  I also find Deer Off leaves a slight residue after drying, but it is negligible.I have success using this concentrate, but then again, have success with other deterrents too.  The ingredient list for most brands are pretty much the same.  Deer Off repels using scent and taste (capsaicin added), whereas others deter simply by scent.  Anyone who prefers a ready-to-use formula might want to tryLiquid Fence 112 Deer and Rabbit Repellent, 1-Quart Ready to UseorBobbex B550170 Ready to Use Deer Repellent with E-Z Pump Sprayer, 48-Ounce.

5.0,"I have never really wanted one of these blowers as I hate when the neighbors run there big gas models they roar. This is just like a loud hair dryer and not heavy at all. I like the variable power and the long lasting battery. I gave it a challenge today. This weekend we cut down tall grasses that have a black mulched hill in front of them. There was a lot of brown grass on the mulch and that made the area look messy. I got this out and set it on level 2 enough to blow the grass into the grass to rake up without moving the heavier mulch. Did the job of the 30 foot area in 6 min! I was delighted. No more running the lawn mower up and down the drive and sidewalk to clear grass clipping away a fast walk with this no sweat.I tried it on the highest level 6 on dirt and debris on the patio and it did a good job. It has a edge on the bottom to nudge things that may be stuck. I would say this is light to medium duty not gonna blow really thick wet mud and leaves. I love it is battery operated and not so loud and light weight. The older I get the more help I need to do the yard work.

5.0,"For several years I've used the little brother of this product with great success.  This unit is larger and more refined.  It's super simple to use - drop some bait in, place it, and turn it on.  The green light turns on for a few seconds to let you know that it's operable.  If there's a path for electrical current flow (a short) the red light will start flashing.  This probably means that it's wet or that it needs cleaning.  Usually it just needs to dry for a while.  When a rodent enters the unit, a series of high voltage pulses are applied and the rodent is quickly killed.  The red light flashes to let you know to empty the trap and reset it.  You never need to touch (or for that matter even see) the rodent - just dump it out in the trash.  The smaller version uses AA batteries and this one uses D batteries.  Unless the unit gets wet, the batteries last through many kills.  The instructions say that it's for indoor use only, but I've used it outdoors with great success.  The only issue that I've encountered is that, when it rains, the unit has to be taken to a dry area and allowed to dry.  So far, and I've used the smaller ones for years, they always come back to full function after they dry out.  They work on mice, rats, chipmunks and squirrels.  I can finally grow a garden without having the vegetables eaten before I can harvest anything.  The only downside is that they aren't discriminating.  If it will fit in the trap, it will be killed.  That hasn't been an issue so far because I bait it with vegetables and that entices the critters that eat my vegetables.  Highly recommended.",1375228800,2013-07-31

I'm short, if I sit all the way back,  they're not as comfortable for me.~The back of the chair is not straight up & down, but is angled back with a gentle  curve that adds character as well as comfort.~The chairs are lightweight & easy to move.~I wish the cushion's matching elastic band, which secures it to the seat, was the same color as the chair. Because the chair is dark brown & the cushion is beige, the elastic band shows up quite a bit when the chair is viewed from the back.

4.0,"This Review is for the Weber Q 2400 Electric Grill.Webers are just great grills no matter which one you decide on. The Q series are just neat little grills that are so versatile. I have a huge mega burner rotisserie stainless thing that just sits there now that I have used a Weber Q. They are just simple and don't require a whole lot of anything to use and clean. Plus you can move them all over easily since they weigh so little.I have, and still use, a Weber Q series propane grill model 230 that has a taller grill lid in case I want to do a turkey. Thought at the time I would do some turkeys two years ago, so far haven't grilled a big bird. List of things to do I guess.The downside to the propane other than keeping tabs on the amount of fuel in the tank so you don't run out half way through is that the regulators are very temperamental and you never know how long it will take you to get it started. The safety feature shuts off the main valve if it is hit with full force gas, like turning the tank valve on. It can take up to five minutes later for the safety valve to stand down and let it flow. So yeah thats a pain, and it does not always do it so you have the excitement of never knowing if it will ignite now or later.The electric is a great model. The only downside I have found is that it has no temperature gauge like the propane. That seems just stupid, as a gauge is really necessary on grills for proper cooking unless you like everything rare or burnt. Ok maybe thats an exaggeration but it is helpful to know the cooking temp.The electric is easier in most ways than the propane to operate, and cook with. Either way you are not going to go wrong thats for sure. Like the propane it has two grates that can easily be cleaned, and this model of the electric has two heating elements.Here are the official specs on this model and this model only.

You throw away the trap and you're done.  The only problem is that the hole is very tiny.  I have not been able to lure a mouse into the trap with even the smelliest cheese or freshest peanut butter.  Perhaps someplace where the mice are smaller, this would work better.  This is why I gave it three stars instead of one.  There was a time that I killed a mouse that had a family and when the babies were forced out to find food, the standard mousetraps were not sensitive enough to catch them.

5.0,"Last evening Mrs. Spudman asked me to loosen a bolt on her new sewing machine. I couldn't budge it using the tiny screwdriver included with the machine. Using my long-handled screwdriver, I turned the bolt easily. Therein lies part of the secret of the special performance of the Fiskars PowerGear lopper - its long handle. I may have earned a D in physics back in the day, but I know what works - like this pair of loppers and my long handles Fiskars ax. Both are marvelous.The head of the Fiskars lopper is encased in a clear plastic cover that I removed using the pictogram instructions. These pictograms are often used in Fiskars products to convey directions. The hard plastic cover may be kept on the loppers during storage, but judging from my past history, I'm likely to lose it.Owning four pairs of loppers presently, including a smaller pair of Fiskars, and having owned countless pairs previously, I'm not new to loppers and the lavish promises made by promoters. My former favorite Corona loppers are supposed to have 3x power; they perform well though I've never been convinced of their super power.These long-handled Fiskars are the real deal. I used these loppers for several hours to test them out, cutting live and dead branches both. With each cut I was amazed and awed. No other lopper I've ever used comes close to the smoothness and power of these loppers. They are comfortable to use and don't require the back straining effort of other loppers, even on those 2 inch plus cuts. Even cutting branches above my head that required full arm extension was a breeze. I never would have considered paying this much for a pair of loppers, but having used the Fiskars 9482 32-Inch Quantum Hand Lopper, Id have to say they are worth every penny.The power gear mechanism of these loppers works smoothly, unlike the clumsy ratcheting systems I've experienced with other loppers. This patented gearing mechanism ""makes cutting effortless."" Yes, it really does.The blade has a polymer coating for corrosion resistance, the cork handle is light and supportive, and the aluminum alloy used in the loppers' construction is strong yet light. A full lifetime warranty backing the product is a nice bonus.If you go to the Fiskars site, there's precious little about how to maintain these loppers or buying a replacement blade in the future. It's best to clean the blade with rubbing alcohol after each use to maintain the lopper blade and prevent spreading disease. There are many You Tube videos that address sharpening and oiling your lopper to keep it in good condition.",1377216000,2013-08-23

5.0,"I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards, although that wasn't always the case. When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old, heavy manual mower, something that soured me on manual mowers for decades. But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers, and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower, but without the noise, the vibrations or the fumes. I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand.

5.0,"We don't have rats (thankfully) but living out in rural Ohio we have plenty of little field mice. They are cute enough but I don't want them living in our basement.We do have a lot of mice activity in our basement's utility room - judging by all of the mouse droppings.I've used traditional mousetraps - some still in place there - with no results. I did have a different electronic mouse trap that worked well but it had this little drawer you had to remove and then dump. It was pretty gross to see the zapped mice, especially if they were in there for a few days as I don't check it too often.I like the Rat Zapper's design because I don't have to look at the dead mice - I just take the entire unit outside to our trash can and dump them in.The directions suggest placing a couple pieces of dry dog food inside and at the back of the zapper, which is what I did. Within a week I noticed that the red light was flashing, indicating a tenant (I posted a photo of the unit with the red light on).In a nutshell, I like this mouse/rat trap because it's easy to use, it works great, and I don't have to see the dead mice (yes, I am a wimp about that).I recommend the Rat Zapper Ultra Rodent Trap RZU001!",1377129600,2013-08-22

5.0,"I can't imagine an easier way to plant and grow just about anything. I bought 4 Earth boxes and they are all doing well.Even though it isn't necessary, I soaked the seeds and then planted them in a heated, self-watering seed tray. I believe they would have done well if I had just tossed them in the Earthbox and added water. LOL.After my seeds sprouted I transferred them to the Earth Box, trying very hard to follow the instructions carefully. The instructions say not to deviate from what they advise, so I tried hard to do it their way.  Amazingly, everything is growing beautifully! The tomatoes, lettuce, carrots, radishes or radish, because I think I was skeptical and only planted one, but it grew and I harvested it. &lt;grin> I also have squash and cucumbers that are growing happily.These can be used outside or inside, or both since they are on wheels. They do get heavy when full of soil and water though, so even though they are portable, that portability is limited.My creative tendency came out and even though I followed the instructions to the best of my ability, I wanted to push the limits. I enclosed my porch with plexiglass and turned it into a greenhouse so I can grow things in months they aren't supposed to grow. My Earthboxes are in the greenhouse, FULL of growing plants, and it's one of the coldest, iciest Winters Oklahoma City has ever had on record. So, I had to learn how to pollinate some of these plants. Time will tell if the squash responded to my first attempt at pollinating with a soft brush, as I read you are supposed to do when there are no bees available. I'm extremely happy with my Earthboxes. I may buy more. I plan to put them outside when the weather allows. Then I'll try to follow the more ""traditional"" rules that sane gardeners follow.  :)Edited to say that I have bought more. They are full of healthy growing plants and I may even get more Earthboxes for my collection. Some will go out as soon as Winter is over.",1262995200,2010-01-09
4.0,"These vegetable support stakes are a nice 5 feet tall which leaves you at least 4 to 4 1/2 feet once you get it stuck in the ground.  They are coated metal and went into the ground easily on the pointed in.  I didn't even have to use a rubber mallet on them.  If you do have to use a rubber mallet on them, be sure to protect the coating on the stake with a piece of cloth before pounding.  They come with 9 connectors that are 12inches long and snap into place easily so you can configure them anyway you want.  You can make a triangle or free form shape.  They are green and unobtrusive looking.  Rather than tomatoes, I used them for my pole beans that are growing like skyscrapers.  After the pole beans are done, I will move them to my tomatoes which aren't very tall yet.  I'm am pleased with this product and would recommend it.  My only concern would be if the connectors will break of their end clips or not as I reconfigure them.  So far, no problem.",1366588800,2013-04-22
2.0,"I've done a little gardening in the past. Not much, but I've grown a few things in a few square feet in my backyard. If you've ever done the same, I'd skip this product altogether and go straight for seeds or starts. They're MUCH cheaper (a single 99-cent seed packet might contain as many individual seeds as this entire kit), and you don't need to buy a set of 13 different plants that you may or may not even like. While this kit does simplify a few steps, there's nothing difficult about putting a seed in the ground. And while gardening is wonderful, I feel that kits like this just serve to distance people from the experience that much more. Add to that the questionability of the fertilizers added (I prefer something a little more natural), the ""California won't let us sell this manufactured product there"", a little ""only 94% biodegradable"" (what else is in there that WON'T decompose in my soil?), and the questionable safety record of the Scotts Miracle-Gro company (they eventually admitted to poisoning bird seed they sold with pesticides highly toxic to birds). Not a recipe for success.Anyway, I'd suggest starting with something less commercial. Maybe a packet of seeds (or twenty, which will give you ~50 times the growing potential of this kit, and still likely be cheaper). Or a 4-pack of tomatoes for a couple bucks. Tomatoes are good.",1377648000,2013-08-28

I used these claws to shred the leftover chicken and I'm amazed!  The claws fit really well in my hands, and the claws are sharp and strong enough to make quick work of shredding meat.  Since they pull off small bits and don't cut the meat, I was left with a pile of truly shredded chicken meat.  They hand washed easily, and are small enough to store stacked in a drawer when not in use.  I'm also looking forward to using them to lift chickens and turkeys from the roasting pan, without burning myself or dropping the bird and splashing myself with the hot juices.And in the off-chance that some passing thief smells your BBQ and breaks in, you can go all Wolverine on them with these claws and save your shredded meat!

Purchasing Terro liquid is much more economical than purchasing the bait traps.  But, it is very important to be careful how you distribute Terro since it can be harmful to children and pets.  The bait traps enclose the liquid, but they are NOT leak-proof.  So extreme care is still necessary.  If you choose to try this product, I suggest you purchase it from a local retailer.

5.0,"This is a high quality hose - I've had cheaper ones that have broken quickly.  Here in Arizona, hoses usually rot within a year or two (the intense heat and sun kills them), but I am cautiously optimistic about this one.  It works great - I can pick it up, extend to the areas I need to water, and then it all very neatly and tightly coils back together near my spigot.  I think the straight ends are KEY as the other coil hoses I've had didn't have this.  As some of the other reviewers noted, you cannot cover anywhere near 50' of distance with this hose due to the coils and the inability to stretch the hose out flat.  Mine works optimally in a 15-25' range and after that I need to hold one side of it with tension to allow the hose to stretch more, maybe to around 35' of range.  I'm very careful not to stretch the coils more than they are intended because when you do that, they can reverse on themselves and it makes untangling the hose a nightmare.  I'll update this review when the hose fails so if there's no additional note, it's still going strong!UPDATE:  4 months in and this hose is still going strong.  I am impressed with it's ability to recoil just as tightly as it was when I received it on day 1.  Looks great underneath my spigot.  I just ordered a 2nd one.",1392508800,2014-02-16

The planter portion is about 8&#34; deep and is somewhat wide, you can easily get a flat of flowers in.The aesthetics however is where the beauty of this barrel ends. Unlike the Fiskars, which has a diverter to hook up to your downspout, this just has a screened inlet. There is no mechanism to attach this barrel to a downspout. The instructions tell you how to, but there is nothing to do so. Further, with the included instructions and screened method, there is nothing to stop this barrel from overflowing once the top has been reached by the water. There are also holes in the planter portion, which means the soil is going to be a soggy mess all the time unless you close those holes. This is because the inlet and top level of the barrel is above the depth of the planter. If you were to use the planter, I would recommend either a fake plant, or plugging the holes entirely.It is nice that the barrel comes with decent hardware for the lower and upper spigot.",1396828800,2014-04-07

4.0,"This pair of scissors definitely lives up to the Fiskars high reputation. If you watched the promotional video, I can tell you the scissors truly do almost everything shown.I do say almost: I have three problems with the scissors.1) The box opener/tape opener was not great, in my opinion.2) Using the pull-apart blade as a knife is handy, but it's a bit awkward to hold safely. Maybe I could get used to it, but I'm not sure I'd want to.3) I very much dislike the bottle opener. It makes pulling the scissors out of their case difficult and potentially painful. I can imagine how some people would find it useful, but it isn't to me - it's just in the way.Having gotten those negatives out of the way, though, let me take a minute to just rave about everything else.-The scissors truly can bounce back and forth from cutting fabric to cutting cardboard and plastic, to small branches, and back to fabric. Having been trained from early in life that a pair of scissors is ruined for fabric as soon as it touches paper, this is a HUGE deal to me.-The awl amazed me. I didn't have leather to try, but it pierced thick cardboard as if it were putty! Perfect for starting holes!-The twine and wire cutters also definitely work as advertised, smoothly and cleanly.-Being able to take the scissors apart for cleaning is another great plus, allowing them to truly remain multi-purpose even after an especially dirty job.This product is definitely worth every penny.

The hanger is a copper colored metal. Because of this, it is very lightweight. That might be a plus for someone who could not easily refill a heavier feeder.You replenish each silo by removing it from the hanger, unscrewing the silo from the base, refilling with seed or water, and then screwing the base back on and rehanging. They don't hold a lot of seed or water so I think I will have to refill them frequently. I hung it in a spot where I had a different feeder and within minutes, there were birds at the feeder and the waterer.I was pleased to see that there are drainage holes on the base of the seed silo so that in the event of rain, the seed will not get soggy/wet/moldy.My concern is that the plastic will become brittle and break quickly in the brutal Texas sun, but I hope I am wrong.

I have doubts that this ""strap"" will hold up long-tern, but even without the strap, the cushion can be used on the chair.

The cushions can be removed for cleaning, so that's nice.I liked how lightweight and easy to move these chairs were.Both my SO and I sat in these chairs. We're very different weight-wise and we both found the chairs to be comfortable.I do like that these are plastic (resin) wicker, or as I like to call it, ""plicker"". I have other chairs made with this material and it's easy to care for, clean and always looks nice. They are comfortable to sit on, too, as the plastic won't burn your thighs like metal chairs can.

5.0,"Some of this review is copied from another review I wrote for the smaller, round holder made by the same manufacturer (product is similar, just different format/size).I recently moved, and none of the flower pot holders I was using at the old house would work on the narrow fences and wide railings at the new one, and they were also not adjustable, so I thought I was out of luck.Came across this, and it works great!Construction seems to be very good as well, with better than average quality screws/bolts (with appropriate weather protection), which is a rare thing these days, even on higher end stuff sometimes. Amazing how using cheap hardware (screws, bolts, washers, etc) can ruin an otherwise fine product.Anyhoo, I use this specifically to sit on a PVC deck railing, that is much wider than normal.  Not only does this holder allow you to adjust to fit on different sized railings (width), but it also adjusts length wise to accommodate long or short flower pots.  Awesome!This also has a mechanism, which prevents the holder from tilting forward or backward (a problem I had with previous holders)....which is really just a piece of bent metal. Such a simple thing, but it makes a big difference! It even prompted me to look at my other, older holders, to see if they had something to keep the holder level, but nope (and of course they would tend to tilt forward).One other small detail about the attention to quality by the manufacturer. You usually see products like this (especially if you go to a large big box hardware store) try to get away with as few bolts/nails/screws as possible, but this unit has THREE bolts for each ""arm"" (6 total), which may be overkill, but I for one was happy to see that compared to the one that you would normally see (or none at all, like the one I had before - just relied on gravity).Top product, highly recommended.

I was able to mow thick grass without the mower bogging down, despite the fact that it was also set to mulch, which puts a bit more of a load on the motor. As mentioned elsewhere, the bag is rather small, and the bag's snap-on handle promptly fell off the first time I tried to lift the still-empty bag (doesn't anyone test these things?). The mower is surprisingly lightweight, and would be a good choice for someone with limited strength. That said, I would hope that a 50 ft. or shorter electric cable could be used, as the shorter length permits a lighter gauge to be employed. The heavy 12-gauge 100 ft cables are relatively cumbersome to drag around. It should be noted that even when the mower is set to leave the longest length of grass (highest setting), the grass still is not left very tall. If the mower is used at one of the lower settings, it might cause considerable stress to the lawn during a dryer or hotter period.",1404864000,2014-07-09

This product worked really well. I set it out and in one day, the rat nibbled the bait and hasn't been seen since. His hole has leaves over it so clearly he isn't going in and out now.I would recommend securing somewhere if you have strong winds as this is a lightweight product and the wind blew it clear across the deck one day.

4.0,I debated on getting this or an electric smoker. I am really glad I got the Weber. You have to be an idiot not to figure out how to use this. It works great and requires very little attention while smoking. I used this for the first time this past Saturday. Smoked a boston butt for 13 hours and never had to add more charcoal. Used the Minion Method for starting the coals. Did not season the smoker as some suggested and it turned out freakin awesome. It held a steady temperature between 225 and 239 degrees with very little to do on my part. Get one...you will be glad you did.,1380499200,2013-09-30
3.0,"On the product label it says this pot holder is ""for decks, balconies and fences"".  The planter has U shaped brackets that are designed to slip over a flat 2x4 or 4x4 or 2x6 railing, but this design doesn't work on a privacy fence.  My fence has no top mounted 2x4 so there is no place to hook the bracket.  I even tried screwing the brackets into the fence's 4x4 post, but the pot's brackets are 4 1/2"" apart so that didn't work either.In the end I just hung the pot on the wooden support of glider/swing that I have on the patio.

1.0,"This is more rant than review, so appreciate it for that, or not.Toro does not sell parts to fix these, nor for the previous 51598 model. The idea is to throw them away after a season or two (two in my case). This is not right and it is not appreciated at all and makes the device NOT RECOMMENDED even though it works well. I will check out a Sears blower because they have parts and nice parts diagrams. Maybe there are others.Mine was the usual smoking motor. Electrical motors have been around for a long time now and there is no excuse for making one that only lasts a few running hours. Simply just cheaply made junk. Don't blame the Mexicans who assembled it, they aren't responsible for the engineering or specifications and just put it together as well as anyone else could have.The CEO probably got a bonus for this. Let me do my little part to maybe prevent a couple of sales.This is disgusting and no amount of blowing power makes up for it if the company sucks.You have to wonder what other cute surprises this company has for you in their other products, even the big ticket stuff. You can assume this is an indication of what they chortle about around the boardroom table when they are passing out bonuses in a circle.Read all the reviews of those who have dealt with their service centers. There is a pattern there, one of essentially ripping off the customer and then treating them poorly. At least they should be gentle.I certainly suggest you keep looking and at least consider another brand.********************************* Update****************************I took the blower apart to see if I could fix this before I tossed it. The smoke was not coming from the switch as it appeared, and what others reported, but straight from the motor. I used light sandpaper to clean the armature and also the end of the brushes. It has since worked perfectly for many leaf-blowing sessions, even at full power. Maybe there was some sort of manufacturing debris or chemical on there that caused some sort of resistance or simply lit up. Anyway, not too hard and saves you some money and you don't have to throw it in the trash.",1262908800,2010-01-08
4.0,"I bought the Black & Decker 36volt trimmer when it first came out and I used it so much I wore out two batteries. The WORX 40volt trimmer is a great successor.It has all the features that I wished were on my old Black & Decker;A faster recharge: My old one would take all night to recharge, this one only needs a little over an hour.A gauge on the battery: With a push of a button, you can see how much juice you have left. This should be standard on all rechargeable batteries.A throttle: You have three speed settings so you are not running at max all the time. You can ""throttle down"" for just basic grass trimming, but ""throttle up"" when you come across a big weed or a tough patch.Longer run time: This is an aspect of the throttle control, and I have got almost an hour out of this trimmer which is more than enough to trim my yard.Now there are a couple of things that could be improved;All rechargeable trimmer should come with two batteries! One to trim while one recharges. In fact I haven't even found where to buy an additional battery.Needs twin cord head: All the commercial trimmers I use at work have twin cord on their heads but this one has just a single line. The head is easy to open and refill, but I just think the twin cord cuts better.It is very light almost too light: As I am used to using commercial trimmers at work, this one is just too light. I am considering adding some weights to the head just to make it easier to handle. And speaking of the handle, it needs a O ring to attach a shoulder harness so we can have that option.Overall this is a great trimmer and a definite improvement over previous models and is great for basic house and garden work.",1367971200,2013-05-08

3.0,"so, I was trying to save some money and avoid buying an electric or gas powered de-thatching rake/power rake.  I thought this would be a good idea, and I will say, it works as designed but it is HARD work.  Now, this being said, my lawn has a pretty thick layer of thatch because I have a mulching, push mower.  I don't bag for multiple reasons, but bottom line, I needed a way to thicken my grass up.  The only way to do this is either aerate or remove the thatch, which I chose the thatching rake.  I worked my butt off for about 2 hours and had gotten only about 20% of my yard complete, if that.  Not sure if it's supposed to do this, but the head would swivel over about 2-4 rakings, and you will have to flip it over, to get the preferred angle.  It might be meant to do it like this, but I typically don't read directions.Its ok, nothing great, nothing horrible.  I will say the quality seems good, it's got a solid wood handle, and I think it will last longer than I'll even care to use it.  I suppose, in a pinch, you could swing this thing around and do some damage to zombies.  however, I would prefer a piercing/slicing weapon for zombie battles, for obvious reasons.",1374796800,2013-07-26
5.0,"I have a little over 4 acres of land around my home in rural Ohio -- most of that land is around the barn and pasture. I've been using this Toro all summer and it has not let me down yet.It's been more than powerful enough to tackle all of the long, hard-to-reach grass and weeds immediately around my house and surrounding trees, shrubs and fence. That task takes around 30-45 minutes minutes.I've never had the battery run out on me -- my arms wear out on me before the battery. That said, even though the Toro 51486 Cordless is light-weight at 8 pounds (relatively speaking compared with gas-powered trimmers), it still gets heavy after awhile. I strung a bit of rope around it and created a makeshift shoulder strap which really helps.The unit is very easy to use. I particularly like the flower-guard, which let's you trim right up next to flowers and other desirable plants without hurting them. My last trimmer didn't have one and I sometimes slipped-up and whacked flowers.The edger feature works well on walkway/driveway sections that already have a nice edge and just need to be cleaned-up a bit. I tried it on the driveway up to the barn, which has never been edged, and it got bogged down a bit.I've never weed-whacked the tall grasses and weeds that grow along the fence to the pasture, but did so just to really put the Toro 51486 Cordless to the test. It did very well, much better then I thought. It took a few extra passes to whack everything down, but it got the job done.In summaryPros:* Very easy to setup and use right out of the box (after charging the battery)* Long battery life. My arms give out before the battery does.* Flower-guard: Let's you trim right up next to flowers and other desirable plants without hurting them.Cons (and these really aren't cons, but might be useful to know):* It's lightweight at 8 pounds, but it gets heavy after awhile. Would be nice if a shoulder strap was included.* Edger is really only good for walkways and driveways that have been previously edged. Gets bogged down a bit when tackling a long-neglected stretch.",1343606400,2012-07-30
4.0,"As with most people I know in the Northwest, we are avid gardeners and optimists to the max when it comes to being able to raise tomato plants.  Still, we have figured out that you need short times for ripening and you need to keep your plants well supported.To that end, I decided to give this product a try.  Things that really interested me were the following:1.  Compact storage:  There is NEVER enough room to store all of the garden stuff an that especially applies to tomato cages.  Most are very bulky, but this one breaks down into small and easy to store pieces.2.  Moveable supports:  I have not yet found a tomato plant that will put it branches just where the preformed supports are in most tomato cages.  Thus, having the ability to move a support to where it is needed is great.3.  Metal stakes that are plastic coated:  The base construction of this unit uses plant supports that I have used for years in the garden.  They are basically hollow metal stakes that are plastic coated.  I have several that are over 15 years old and are still providing garden structure support.4.  Extra supports are available:  Amazon carries extra support cross members, but there is a catch, you have to have an order that totals more than $25 or they will delete it from your order!!!!  So, if you think you want extra supports, order them at the same time you order your plant supports!Here is what I liked about working with the product:1.  Very easy to assemble and the assembly can be accomplished either before the plant is in the ground or after the plant is in the ground.  Personally, I think it is much easier to put the unit together, install it in the ground, and then plant your plant.  Keep in mind that you MUST insert the legs of this unit at least 12 inches into your ground if you want it to provide good support for a heavy tomato plant!!!!!!!!!!!!  that is NOT mentioned anywhere in their instructions, but it is what most gardener's would do if they were building their own support.2.  Once assembled and installed in the ground, it is VERY easy to move support members around!!!  Remember to follow the directions about clipping the supports on from the inside and NOT from the outside.3.  The green color of the materials disappear into the foliage of the plants making it more visually appealing.Here is what I did not like about the product:1.  Amazon limiting the ability to order extra supports unless your total order is more than $25.  The way it is worded on the website, it looks like free shipping is limited unless the order is more than $25.  That is not what they are saying,  your ability to order it at all is limited to the fact that your total order must be at least $25 or they will remove it from your order.  This makes no sense to me since there are many low cost items that you can order on Amazon.  Thus, if you order some batteries for $5 and supports for $15 for a total order of $20, they will remove the supports from the order and only ship out the $5 of batteries!  What sense does that make???????????Overall, I am currently happy with the product, but will need to come back and update this after the growing season to be able to add how well this works with plants as they grow.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and flexible support system.  Just remember my caution about including any additional supports you want with your order.",1368748800,2013-05-17

4.0,"As a landlord for the past dozen years, one thing I've had to learn to deal with is pests of all types - the most recent is a tenant that leaves dog food out in the open and has the occassional visit from mice. Now, I'm not typically a 'girlie girl' but there are limits to what I will deal with...sewer/toilet issues and pests totally flip me out. I call the professionals at the first sign of trouble.Unfortunately, hiring a professional to take care of mice gets expensive especially when the tenant goes back to the same old habits of leaving dog food out in the garage as soon as the problem clear up. Apparently, these are some type of ""field mice"" that burrow into the ground out in the field...however, they come in searching for food and water which the tenant supplies via the dog food.After getting sick and tired of spending $200 per call to the pest control company, I thought this might do the trick. The contraption was smaller than I expected but I like the fact that it doesn't use harsh poisons that could harm pets nor mechanical traps that kids could get into....tenants are not always the most reliable about these things so the ability to set it up and revisit from time to time is a big plus.I've had this over a month and to date, we've not caught any mice but the problem is a sporadic one. The tenants also haven't seen any mice recently. However, I still give this a four star because it seems to be well built, does NOT use toxic chemicals and has safety features that make it very useful for use in a rental. I also like the fact that it is more humane than other options - the tenants appreciate that as well. In fact, just placing this in the garage seems to have helped remind the tenants to clear away the dry dog food and help the problem...making this worth it's weight to just sit there! Seriously though, well worth the effort given the benefits for off-site locations.",1314144000,2011-08-24

I was skeptical, but this little hose surprised me.  It is lightweight, packs small in its own little bag and really does get to be a full size hose.  I think it will be perfect for camping when we need to hook the up camper or just hose off something at the site.  It's so small it won't take up much space at all.It got four stars instead of five because the pressure isn't great, but it's cool for what it is.  Also, I think it will be good for watering plants because you can adjust it to a fine mist.  It's so light you can hang it from a post or a decorative gnome in the garden.Next time we get bored, we'll just get out the hose.  Oh, the dog liked it too.  She thought it was fun to chase.

It would be nice if there were a visual indication that it was fully wound.I was hoping that this would put an end to the adage, ""the early bird gets the worm, but the late mouse gets the cheese.""  Unfortunately, our mice don't seem to be interested in going into this thing even with peanut butter in it.The single mouse we caught was when my daughter chased one of the mice in the barn into it and blocked its exits.Perhaps this would work with city mice, but country mice just don't want to enter this hotel.",1401321600,2014-05-29

I do have a couple of areas of concern, that may prove to be baseless, and these (along with the highlights) are listed below.What I liked about this feeder:1. The mouth of the feeder is wide enough to pour the nectar in with ease.2. Both ends screw off on this feeder, so clean up is a breeze. *3. The glass tube is thick so this part of the feeder should last for ages.4. The feeder looks very nice, not overly garish.5. The bee guards are a great idea.6. The 12 ounce capacity makes refilling less of a hassle.My concerns:1. While the 12 ounce capacity is nice, I am worried that mold will be an issue if the humming birds are not feeding frequently. (I only filled the unit a quarter full and am going to monitor how quickly the nectar goes before increasing the amount I put in - we are early days for humming birds right now.)2. Rust - these sorts of feeders are always prone to rusting, time will tell if this is an issue with this particular unit.3. Color - I really do not like overly garish feeders but we all know that humming birds are attracted to flash, this unit is on the elegant side and time will tell if it has enough brightness to attract the birds.Recommended with above reservations.*The totally unintentional rhyming ends here - you are welcome.",1398211200,2014-04-23

4.0,"I've wanted a lemon tree with flowers and fruit on it, like the photos, since forever. After  reading the reviews, I went ahead and orderd it. The tree arrived fast via USPS, well packed with styrofoam popcorn, wrapped in paper to keep the branches together, and masking tape over the soil. Its a vigorous tree, with roots reaching the bottom of the 8"" grower's pot. It only lost a few leaves and a small branch during shipping. Watering immediately after recieving the tree, perks it right up. However, I dont have a single flower or fruit on my tree. I emailed Hirts about this. They answered the email within a couple of hours. He explained that they got a new shipment of plants in, and that my plant would flower in 1-2 weeks. Since I dont even see flower buds, i'm not so sure. So, if you are buying this plant, expecting to recieve the immature lemons, or flowers, that the other reviewers have....you are going to be disappointed. However, if you just want to get a nice tree, that will eventually flower and fruit, this seems to be a good deal.ONE YEAR UPDATEWOW, did this tree surprised me, after I wrote this review. I had transplanted it, after a couple of weeks, into a larger pot, about 3 gallon, using a well draining mix. Then, I fertilized it with high nitrogen fertilizer. That's when it took off. First, it grew some amazing branches. All over,8-10 large branches, some with big leaves. Then, it flowered. I'd say all this happened within 6 weeks of the review. I reduced the number of baby lemons on the tree to TWO baby lemons. By September, the two lemons were the size of silver dollars. WHen it got cold out, say early October, I bought it inside, to an unheated room with a big window. (In the dead of winter, I used a supplemental florescent grow light.) The two lemons grew and grew, plus the tree was in flower, from Christmas time, right up until the time I took it outside. (early may.) RIGHT NOW, I have two lemons ready to pick, with a lot of baby lemons on the tree. The two lemons are HUGE...the size of an orange. People always remark about the size of the lemons.

5.0,"Although I have a full-size grill, a portable table-top grill is handy to have when cooking for just 2 people at home, or for taking along on an outing. I had been using a cheapo portable grill that was on its last legs (literally), so I was very happy to get this as a gift. What a difference!I'm very pleased with this both in terms of performance as well as construction quality. It heats very evenly -- I've yet to find a cold spot on the grill even when it's packed full. The construction quality is as you would expect from a Weber -- beefy grates, strong handles, and solid body construction. I expect this will last for quite a few years.Attaching the propane cannister is very easy, and lighting it is a snap. Although I'm only using it with a portable propane cannister, it has the ability to be hooked up to a large size tank.There are other models in the Weber Q line that provide additional features, such as foldable work trays for the side. This model is the least expensive, and I think it provides the best value. Still, any of the Q models should be on your short list if you're looking for a portable gas grill. Pricy, but the performance and construction justifies the cost. Highly recommend.",1345161600,2012-08-17
3.0,"I take off my own trash.  Unfortunately that has attracted some creature that gets on the back of my truck bed very often and tears open my garbage.  I'm really not sure if it was a cat or a raccoon.  It was a smart little creature, because I set cage traps and it would always manage to turn the trap over to get the food out but not get caught.  I thought it might be a racoon or a cat.  I used this thinking it might be a stray cat.Here's what I did - I pressure washed the entire truck, bed and all, then I parked it someplace else for 3 nights.  I sprayed it with Dog and Cat-B-GON and so far, it has kept the critter off my truck and out of my trash completely for a bit over couple of weeks.  I can't say for SURE that it was this product that helped, or if it was my other preventative measures.It's convenient to just spray the truck and bag when I put the trash in the back of the truck.  I've not had ONE ripped open bag.  I do know the feral cats are still out there at night- I've seen them.My other problem was my own cats getting on TOP of my greenhouse.  I sprayed all around the greenhouse and around the top.  However, the cats are STILL getting up there.  It's like they don't notice it.Long story short - it's very easy and convenient to use, and I think it works sometimes - but it might be working for raccoons and not cats. It doesn't work all the time though - I know that for a fact.",1401667200,2014-06-02
5.0,"We mix Miracle-Gro Perlite with peat and it is the perfect combination for our rhododendron cuttings. The Perlite allows the mixture to drain freely and the little roots to develop. When the cuttings are ready to move into a larger container, they can easily be lifted out of the potting mix without damaging the newly formed roots.We also will mix the Perlite with compost, soil, quarter minus gravel, and bark dust to form a planting mix.  Place the larger rhododendrons directly on the top of the mix on the ground. No need to dig a large hole. We live in the Pacific Northwest and have heavy clay soil. You do not want to place rhododendrons in a hole in the ground. Mix the planting mix and place the larger rhody plants on top of it. Mulch around the sides of the plant with bark dust.  Rhododendrons are shallow rooted plants and will develop a fine web of roots growing into this planting mix.Following this planting method, your rhododendrons will thrive for many years. We have seen some that at 63 years old!",1394496000,2014-03-11

5.0,"The Mr Grill 18&#34; Oak Barbecue Spatula is ideal for adding to your grilling accessories. It is large enough to help the user from getting to close to the coals or flame on even a large barbecue grill. We grill several times a week in our household, so finding a spatula that not only does its job well, but washes up easily and is manufactured in a way that you know it will be ok to become attached to it as it will be around for many years to come with its sturdy construction, is good. Added bonus is that it has a bottle opener fit right into it. While I at first thought, well, that would be awkward to use when the spatula is all dirty and greasy from use (and I imagine it would be) but when it is clean and hanging from the grill on it's leather cord and you are lounging out in the yard, it can be a handy item to know is there and not have to grab a bottle opener for those times you are not grilling and just enjoying the outdoors nearby.

3.0,"I ordered this, as others did, thinking it was a window box which it is not, although with a little adjusment I think it could be used that way. I think the listing should make it clear that it is for deck railings or fences.  Some peoples came bent but mine came completely missing the left hand adjustable piece.  I contacted the company days ago and have not heard anything from them so don't expect any customer service from that direction.  Amazon is always good about returns and exchanges so buy this in person at your local store or from Amazon so you can exchange it if yours happens to be missing pieces when it arrives.  So, why did I give it 2 stars?  I was going to give it 1 star but we took off the other adjustable end piece and just set the planter box in what was left and it IS amazingly strong.  Time will tell if it will widen to the point of collapse with no end pieces to hold it in place but it is 'working' for now.  The adjusters for the deck rail are easy to use but be warned that if your rail is narrow the horizontal pieces go so far into the planter box area you may not have enough room left for the box.  Also, as someone else pointed out there is a u shaped brace on the bottom and under ideal mounting conditions it would keep the bottom of the planter pushed out but this may or may not be effective depending on how your deck railing is constructed.  I do like the finish, in fact I want to like the whole thing.  I am just distressed about the missing piece which spoils the whole effect.Update - Ok.  I upped it to 3 stars because I have actually heard from the company.  If I actually get the missing piece I will be changing this review to 5 stars.",1367539200,2013-05-03
2.0,"I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.",1307577600,2011-06-09
2.0,"Three years ago, at the recommendation of a friend, I bought a squirrel-resistant bird feeder (Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic). It worked so well that even the heavier bully birds couldn't feed from it. I have all kinds of birds who feast from this feeder, so I decided I should get a second one. This Perky Pet feeder became available, so I was happy to give it a try. It is much cheaper than my other one, and the difference demonstrates that you do indeed get what you pay for. The squirrels figured out how to get into this one pretty quickly. So did the starlings.This feeder has a nice design, and it looks like it should work just fine. It has a spring mechanism that pulls down the plastic shell over the feeder holes when something heavy sits on one of the perches. Unfortunately, a couple of the feeder holes on this model are high enough that the squirrels just have to hang down from the top of the feeder - without putting weight on a perch - and feast away. I do have this on a tall metal shepherd's hook, so *that* deters many of the squirrels. And I have considered covering up the higher feeder holes to keep the rest of them out. I certainly wouldn't recommend hanging this from a tree or post or anything that squirrels can easily climb. Because of where I placed the feeder, most of the bird seed is actually going to the birds, but it's not because this feeder is squirrel-proof.",1362355200,2013-03-04
5.0,"My backyard is a certified wildlife habitat but I have found most himmingbird feeders to be tiny, not durable, or a tad tacky.This is actually an art piece to the eye! The raised lettering truly makes it look like an antique bottle and it's quite heavy and durable. (except for the color---it's not red glass but a red wrap. I'll get to that)There is room for a few hummingbirds to feed at a time which makes it even better and they found it quickly. I think that is because the red bottle stands out so well in the tree that it truly drew them to it.I was surprised that the bottle didn't print the recipe for the hummingbird sugar water but that was simple to google.I use raw sugar that isn't bleached and processed and all should know never to put red food coloring in the water as was old school--that actually is toxic and will kill the poor hummingbirds.Even when they are not feeding, this bottle is beautiful. I do clean it out about once a week as I do all feeders because any mold is toxic to birds as well and it can grow easily in sugar water. You have to hand wash this.Really a well done piece BUT I hate I have to hand wash it and frankly because it's got a red colored wrap on it rather than it being real red glass like I originally thought I worry that the red dyes might make this toxic. I can't watch the hummingbirds days after they drink and I have lots of them---my one negative is red real glass would be better for both washing and toxicity.",1340236800,2012-06-21

This is a new model, but it has all the important features I look for in a quality hummingbird feeder--glass, easy hanging (S hook), durability and no leakage.  I like this particular feeder because the wide mouth makes cleaning and filling easy, the base separates in half (again for easy cleaning) and it has built in bee guards and an ant moat.  Most important, hummingbirds like it.  We have over ten different feeders hanging around the yard, and it's obvious which ones are preferred.  Their favorite feeders aren't the fanciest or most expensive, but they all resemble this fundamental glass tube style.UPDATE:  This feeder leaks like a sieve!  It held liquid just fine for about a month, but now the two-part base just doesn't seal.  I checked reviews, and sure enough, lots of other people are experiencing the same problem.

3.0,"My wife loves to feed the birds and one of her greatest pleasures is seeing a variety of birds come and go. I am always on the lookout for bird feeders that will make her hobby that much more enjoyable so I was interested in trying the Perky Pet 363 Birds and Berries Lantern Feeder. Although it is an attractive feeder it does not suit our needs, the problem being wind.This is an attractive little feeder that at a minimum makes a lovely decorative addition to the yard. The silhouette of a cardinal on the clear plastic wall is not gaudy but actually adds to the appearance of an otherwise rustic-looking lantern style.Filling this feeder is simple and easy.Emptying the feeder is easy too - hang it in a windy area and the seed blows out relatively quickly. The problem is that the hole through which the birds can get to the seed is too wide and as a result the wind can easily disturb the seed within. This is an unfortunate issue. More of a concern, though, is that smaller birds such as chickadees might be able to squeeze into the feeder through the same hole.A creative and industrious person could certainly make an adjustment with some well-placed plastic and a little tape to narrow down the opening. However, this should not be a necessary step just to make this feeder keep its seed. In calm areas where there is little wind, this is actually a nice feeder that attracts the birds. In windier areas, though, it's better suited as a decorative element.",1348099200,2012-09-20
3.0,"UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW:Months have gone by, and writing Landmann customer service has gotten me nowhere regarding the damaged smoker I received.  By contrast, I have worked with Weber customer service in the past for issues related to their smoker, and found them to be quick to respond, and quick to solve the problems I had.This Landmann has been used to cook salmon, ribs, and more.  It does a nice job.  Being able to control the temperature with such precision is a major benefit of this smoker over my Weber Smokey Mountain charcoal-based smoker.  There IS convenience in an electric smoker in terms of setup and temperature control.  However, I find that cleaning the charcoal smoker is easier (perhaps because it can lifted, dumped, rinsed with a hose, and so on).  I also personally prefer the taste of charcoal-smoked food over this electric cooker.  The taste of charcoal-smoked seems more ""authentic"", whether I use lump hardwood or the standard blue bag of Kingsford charcoal (stay away from using lighter fluid!).So, despite the damage to this Landmann, it's fine.  My Weber will continue to be my go-to smoker.  But, when I want to be able to smoke something on a moment's notice, the minimal work in setting up the Landmann makes it a nice convenience.  I have updated my review from 2 stars to 3 because the damage the unit suffered (in manufacturing or in shipping) does not seem to have affected its performance.HERE'S MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:A damaged unit, poor customer service, and some incovenient operating requirements have killed my initial enthusiasm for an electric smoker.I have been using a Weber Smokey Mountain charcoal smoker for several years now, and love it...I've done ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and whole chickens, and have always been happy with the results.  I got this Landmann electric smoker as a second smoker...not as a replacement.  I am quite fond of my charcoal smoker, but the cleanup after each cook is kind of tedious.  I figured that an electric smoker would bring a little convenience for the times when I don't want to deal with charcoal.For a moment, let's set aside the fact that the smoker arrived damage.  Even without that issue, there are issues that make this much less convenient than my charcoal smoker:1) The cord is roughly 3 feet long.  The instructions explicitly state that an extension cord should not be used (more specifically, it says that the cooking temperature might decrease as a result of using an extension cord).  This means that I have to use the smoker within 3 feet of the electrical outlet on my deck.  However...2) The unit is not supposed to be exposed to rain.  I understand this: it's an electric smoker.  Surely it makes sense not to get it wet.  However, my Weber charcoal smoker sits outside all the time (covered when not in use).  And, it's safe to get the Weber wet, even when cooking.3) Since the unit is not supposed to get wet, I need to put it away when not in use (I don't have a cover yet, but may get one).  The problem is that the thing weighs around 80 pounds.  It is NOT easy to get up and down steps.  It's really a two-person job.  But because my only outlet is on that deck, and because I can't let the smoker get wet, I need to get it up and down my deck steps every time I want to use it.Now, back to the damage: The unit arrived with a noticeable dent near the rear...a dent big enough that it actually affected another piece of metal that connects to it.  Also, one of the included shelves had a broken piece of metal on it, like it was never actually attached to the shelf on one end.  Looking at other reviews, apparently I'm not alone as far as the dents are concerned.  Several other reviewers have the same issue.  The packaging for the smoker seemed perfectly fine, so I suspect that the dent is something that's happening during manufacturing/assembling...not in transit.Finally, there's the customer service: I wrote Landmann right away about the damage to the smoker.  Many days have gone by, and I have yet to hear back from Landmann.  Given the fairly high cost of this smoker, it would be nice to know that there is some kind of user support to go with the smoker.  But so far, nothing.A true review of the smoker ought to include a review of the quality of the food it produces.  However, I wanted to give a heads up about some of the problems you might encounter.  Once I do my first smoke, I will update this review.  (I did run it once with smoke wood, but no meat...something that's part of the initial setup.  That went smoothly.)  Similarly, I will update this review if Landmann customer service ever actually follows up with me.For now, though, it's really hard to recommend this smoker.  It's bound to be a frustrating experience.",1343779200,2012-08-01

You can easly disguise it by covering with pine needles, branches etc. The cage also protects whatever you catch from being injured until you can release it.It is one thing if another animal catches them as a food source, but to kill them because they do the things squirrles, rabbits, etc do is senseless.I have also used it to transport small  injured animals  to the rehabiltation center.

5.0,"We're getting older & I was checking Amazon for any tool that could make our chores easier. I never knew anything like a weed puller existed. When my husband mentioned it was time to tackle the weeds, I told him I'd order this tool.  I ordered it even though it was on backorder & kept my fingers crossed that it would arrive before we needed to put mulch in the flower beds...I didn't want to be out there digging up those nasty weeds. Much to my relief, the tool arrived last week. It is so easy to use!  You position the 4 blades/claws over the center of the weed, step down on the extension, pull the tool towards you & pull back on the handle, pull the tool out of the yard, and push down on the orange grip to eject the weed.  That's it!  Simple & quick. It helps if the soil is moist when you use it.  Mostly, we were pulling up dandelions. Of course, this tool left a hole where the weed was, & it didn't pull up the entire dandelion root...those things are long!  Depending on where we worked, we either kicked some dirt into the hole or put the grass back. We worked in our yard & flower beds the evening after a light rain, so the soil wasn't overly hard. It's recommended to rinse it with water after each use, and to oil claw pivot joints regularly.The Fiskars 7870 has an ""Ease-of-Use Commendation"" by the Arthritis Foundation. It's 'Earth Friendly' because no pesticides are involved. We can't get over how nicely this worked.

One trap is supposed to snap the mouse and thus kill it, and then you go and dispose of it in your trash (hopefully, while wearing gloves!).I would caution you to watch your fingers and set the traps very carefully. Also, sometimes, mice do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the mouse in it. Traps in general are a hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets.

The tiny rubberbands are a little tricky to roll into place, but the only real drawback is that you have to keep up a supply of them.I was kind of surprised this thing works so well.  I haven't had it long, but so far it's doing the job.  It IS all plastic - we'll see how long it lasts, but I never kept those spring-arm traps for more than a couple times...

3.0,"I love push mowers - quiet and when the blades are sharp, they do a great job. This goes for this mower, too. It is ideal if you have a small lawn or want to get a little exercise while mowing. The downside to any push mower is that apparently they require a special skill set to sharpen the blades & most garden shops do not sharpen the blades.  I was able to find one place that sharpens blades in the entire area and it is not cheap. It's not a good idea to do it yourself, quite dangerous, & dull blades are useless. The blades seemed to dull very quickly, if that is possible - maybe they weren't very sharp to begin with. I hope more people will buy push mowers, which will force more shops to consider getting the tools so they can offer sharpening. I have 4 friends who all have the same problem. This has nothing to do with the mower itself, just know that before you buy it, research your area to make sure there is someone who can sharpen it for you.",1383264000,2013-11-01
3.0,"In order for me to grow anything in my food garden, I pretty much need to get the stupid proof started plants from the nursery.  I can grow anything flowers but a vegetable planted in my garden is pretty much an invitation to die.This is a great collection of vegetables and some herbs, the perfect beginning for any salad.  I wish I had been smart enough to use the pull off stickers to make a map of where I put stuff.  On the other hand, one spin and they would all be lost again.I purchased 5 Apollo Plastics H012-MOCHA 12-Inch Self-Watering, hoping to be able to put them in my windowsill by the time the first frost arrives to have a year round vegetable garden in my actual greenhouse window above my sink in the kitchen.  Now you would think that is a pretty safe place for a plant to live, it being that close to a water source AND a hose.  This is where the stupid proof part actually comes in.In my defense, I don't actually have to water anything outdoors. Our summertime 75% standard humidity - to 90% on any given day - occasionally explodes into rain.Anyway, these were planted in hanging planters outside on a rainy day and they are hanging in the section of garden my husband tends so they have a much better chance of survival.Until then, I am off to the Farmer's Market.",1377475200,2013-08-26

5.0,"A couple years ago I bought a rechargeable string trimmer that was an absolute waste of money.  Unless I was trimming the thinnest possible grass it was useless - and the charge barely held.That's why I was so pleased to see all the advancements made with these products.  The 20 volt battery provides plenty of power for typical garden jobs around the house, and the set is nicely constructed while still being lightweight.  The two chargers and two batteries are also a really nice addition to the set.",1310342400,2011-07-11
2.0,"I live in New England was bought this for a christmas gift. Each snow fall I used this with I was not very happy. I could shovel faster than this thing works (with more effort granted). The ability to angle the snow in a particular direction was just above worthless. Half the snow you are angling always ends up going right in front of you. The problem with this, is that this is only rated for 6 inches of snow (though I have used it up to a foot) but as you push the snow you inevitably end up putting the snow right back in front of you adding inches to the snow you are trying to move.I like the idea of electric snow blowers and think it would be a great use for me but without the ability to direct the snow properly this becomes alot more work than necessary in heavy snow. Keep the snow less than 6 inches and you wont have too much of a problem.I do not recommend this product and would never buy this tool for myself. I will be buying the greenworks 12 amp snow thrower to replace this one.",1360540800,2013-02-11
5.0,"I have to say I am quite impressed by this weedeater...I honestly didn't expect much because it is running on a rechargeable battery and my drill isn't too impressive...but weedeating, come on??  Had to see it to believe it, well I am a believer now.  This little monster has some power and I had no trouble cutting thru tall and/or thick grass.  Flip the head and it has a roller for edging and actually did a pretty impressive job, I mean it won't compare to the clean lines you will get with a blade but it is definitely acceptable.  The handle for holding in front is adjustable, the head will also adjust for angle in addition to being able to be flipped for edging.  Pretty easy to get a comfy fit and the whole tool isn't too heavy or awkward to hold.  The only things less than par is that it is a single string trimmer, so allow a little longer in cutting the grass than one with multiple lines.  Also when the battery starts getting low, the power of it fluctuates when you first start to hold the button.  The line feed took me a bit to get used to since I am used to the ones you tap to advance the line, not sure of the need for a change on that issue.  Overall, very please. Battery life is great and there are places to hang up the charger and the weedeater to keep them out of the way.  Best thing...no mixing gas and no trouble starting.  Perfect!",1339113600,2012-06-08

3.0,"This flower box is very pretty and I really liked the option of the adjustable fitting to the deck rails and the expandable option in case I wanted a longer box.  However there seems to be a major design flaw.I got the flower box out of the packaging and put it together (screwed the plastic screwcaps to the brackets to size)  My deck railing is wide, 6 "" , and while it was wide enough to go over the rail it was evident that it wasn't going to stay on the rail.  I was able to just screw into the the decking through the back brackets to hold it tight.  I felt that if there was a return of some sort on the back of the bracket to grasp the railing that might hold it in place better (that is what my other flower box holder has and it stays up fine)If you don't mind screwing into your decking then this would work fine for you.I can not vouch for smaller railings, but this is what might be necessary for the wider ones.",1367712000,2013-05-05

3.0,"When driving this into the ground, I would recommend instead of pounding on the top of the main stake, use a stone or small cement block to pound on the perpendicular welded piece of metal that's attached about six inches from the bottom. The metal was welded on well enough there was no danger of deformation or detachment when I did so. A little paint did chip off, however. Because of this perpendicular piece of metal, you can only drive it down about 6"". If your soil is a bit looser on top, it's not deep enough to keep the stake from wobbling a bit, but enough to keep it in place.The connection threads are really short - less than half an inch for both sides. I would have liked it to be a little longer since I just feel as if there's a better, more secure connection that way. If you leave the included washer in on the incoming connection, the length to connect shortens to about 1/4 inch. I used teflon tape where I could, and have had no issues with leaking around the connections.The faucet points more horizontal than vertical so if you add connections (I attached a 4-way manifold), it juts out, I would estimate, about 70 degrees from the stake. Besides being unsightly, the water shoots out from my manifold mostly horizontally instead of down. It makes it difficult if you're just trying to drop water down from the faucet into a bucket or watering can. With a little testing, you can learn to open the faucet just enough with a low enough flow the water will flow mostly down, hold the bucket up next to the faucet, or just figure out where to place your bucket on the ground wherever the water ends up falling. More guesswork than I would like to bother with.This bib extender works for the basic need of placing a faucet in another location.",1400976000,2014-05-25

The arms on the hanger where the brackets go slid over the ledge far enough that I could put 2 screws through each arm (arms already drilled.)  I screwed it down, and that was that.  The bottom ""U"" shaped piece touches against my wall to give stability.  If your ledge slopes more then a few degrees, or is farther away from the wall then mine, this might not work.  You could probably cobble something together with shims if you wanted to.Besides that, it looks pretty good, and is strong enough for my flowers.  This worked out great for me.

I took my time, gently swinging the spreader around me, and the food appeared to go on evenly. I watered my lawn and let it go.  It's been almost a full month since I applied the food, and I can definitely see a difference between the two sides of my lawn. It's not a huge difference, but it is greener and looks healthier.

5.0,"It seems people are finding this useful so I thought I would write another update. This B&D; Hedge Hog Trimmer is a real work horse. As I have mentioned in the comments section, last week I cut through another cord, and it went through it like butter. This time I spliced it. I'm not paying for another 100 foot cord, those things are expensive! LOL. It was an easy fix, and it is wrapped up well enough that I don't think I will have a problem. I should also mention that I still haven't lifted a finger to maintain it, except for oiling the blades once. Yup, once! I'm so happy to have bought this! Just be CAREFUL!!! :-)UPDATE 2/18/2010:Just to update, I have used this to cut through very thick ivy, etc., and it is still going, and cutting fairly well. I should also note that I have not maintained this at all. I have not cleaned or oiled the blades, etc., and it still works very well. I am VERY pleased with this and recommend it VERY highlyThis is a really great trimmer. It handles thick branches very well. I cut half inch branches easily enough. It is well balanced, and I was even able to use it with one hand when I really had to stretch (I would not recommend this, as it is a bit dangerous). One thing that many people do not consider with these electric tools, sometimes, the extension cord releases easily. This is not the case here, I am happy to report. I am very happy I bought this. It makes my hedge trimming very easy. It is easy to maneuver, and I think you will be very happy using this product.June 2008 addition:Okay, almost a year has passed and this thing is still going strong. It cuts like butter....still. It is easily the best garden tool purchase I have made, and I have made some good ones. It does not bog down unless the branches are REALLY thick (read: do not fit between the teeth completely). Look no further and buy this trimmer. It's just great....the only annoyance is that the plug comes out easily using my new extension cord.....ehem....it seems while I was using the trimmer to clear out more ivy than anyone can imagine, the cord got hidden underneath some of the iyv I had not reached and when I did get to it I might not have been.....ehem....paying as much attention.....cough, cough....as I should have, and, well, you know, ehem, the trimmer stopped working. When I looked down I saw the cord was still plugged into the trimmer, but then I noticed the dangling piece of cord about 8 feet down and am happy to report that if needed this thing will cut through a 12 gauge extension cord with ease and better than any wire cutter! Luckily for me, I did not get any kind of shock, etc., (of course, it was plugged into a GFCI outlet). That's the good news. The bad news is I threw out the extension cord which, at 100 feet, costs almost what the trimmer cost. The good news is my friend later informed me that it is an easy fix to splice the wires back together. Bad news is, he told me this AFTER the garbage men took the garbage.....Lesson learned, and I only mention this in the hopes that everyone who reads this takes better care than I did. All joking aside, this could have had a completely different ending, and I am quite lucky to be able to edit this review. I can only imagine what might have happened if I were standing in a puddle, or something (I don't want to test the GFCI).

2.0,"I'm not totally into organics, but I do try to avoid pesticides as much as possible. And I try not to use chemicals where I don't have to. That being said, my feeble attempts at gardening have grown more weeds than produce, so I was quite excited about the possibilities this product posed for my lawn and garden.Unfortunately, the warnings on this product are a bit off-putting. You are cautioned to avoid contact with skin as well as to wear protective eye covering when dispersing this product. If that's the case, I don't think I want it near my food, much less my children. So, we were very careful about where we placed it--on the patio between pavers, and in landscaped areas where the children don't play. Even had it not been for the children, this weed preventer is not supposed to be used on grass, which wasn't clear when we ordered it. Likewise, it does not eliminate existing weeds, just prevents new ones from growing. For me, that was the biggest issue with this product--to have as many warnings as it does, I'd expect it to kill the weeds that already exist.The power spreader cap was actually not something that we found useful. The cap flips open, and the &#34;power&#34; is in the flipped lid. Basically, the product is like pebbles that fall onto the cap and then are dispersed outward. You are supposed to control the flow by tilting the entire bottle up or down, just as you would if you didn't have the power cap. Perhaps it might be different when the bottle isn't near to full, but it's pretty difficult to control the output. And it's not easy to disperse to smaller areas. Effective or not, I can't see myself purchasing this product in the future.",1399161600,2014-05-04
1.0,"I really like the Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap version . . . powerful, easy to set, and well-designed for a reliable catch/kill.  I looked forward to good results from this Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap, and in fact had a ready test subject targeted, as my daughter had been reporting a mouse intruder in her 100 year old Victorian home with dungeon like basement.  I told her to hold off on deploying her old wood traps so I could  try out these just-received Tomcat Mouse Snap Traps.This mouse version of the trap was indeed, like the rat version, easy to set.  Just push on the heel of the lid, and it pivots and locks open.  That was where the good times ended.First problem was stolen bait.  I didn't have any of the recommended ""Tomcat Mouse Attractant Gel"" in my possession, so I tried pressing on a little glob of trusty sharp cheddar.  Problem is there's really nothing to press the bait onto but an essentially smooth plastic bait/trip platform.  I suspected the bait might get stolen.  It was.  And the second try also.  By this time, I was sure the mouse would be back for try number three, as this trap was just essentially functioning as a feeding station.This third try, I fashioned a paper clip to slip over the edge of the bait/trip platform and help hold the bait in place.  It worked.  A successful capture this time, but . . . .It didn't kill the mouse.  I was left with the task of having to put a trembling badly injured mouse out of its suffering.  I felt as sorry for the little guy as I would have a suffering dog or cat, and felt terrible for having put it in this state of injury.  I have trapped many mice over the years with the old-fashioned wooden Victor type traps.  Nine out of ten times (or more) they produced an instant kill.  That's what I'm looking for.I give the Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap a star for being easy to set with no pinched fingers, and they are indeed not likely to injure your children or pets.

5.0,"I don't think I've ever been so excited to get something in the mail! Could have been the super long and miserable winter, but I could not WAIT to get this set up. Luckily, setup was a breeze and required no tools whatsoever. Screw about six things in by hand, loop the hammock over the hooks and you're in business. In less than ten minutes, I was enjoying my first hammock ever!Some others mentioned an odor/smell, but I didn't notice anything. I set this up outdoors in about 70 degree weather and didn't notice anything and I'm highly sensitive to smells, esp that new plastic/manufacturing smell.I didn't have any struggles putting the pieces together, either. It was so easy to put together and I truly did appreciate not having to use any tools to screw anything into place.I logged about two hours in the 'mock today and I have to tell you, there's no uncomfortable position. I initially was a little skeptical that I'd like a hammock that was so wide (seeing the hammock 'burrito' pictures some others posted left me curious), but I've found that the wideness can sometimes provide some shade, too. There are so many ways to lie on this and it's just so cozy. I opted for the cotton hammock (color: tropical), and not the sunbrella fabric. The cotton is super soft and durable.I will take the cotton hammock part in the garage when not in use, but will leave the stand in the yard all summer.The hammock and stand seem very well-made. I had no hesitation about moving around in it and getting in and out. This hammock can accommodate up to 450 lbs. I had my boyfriend join me in the hammock, but it was kind-of cramped and, as he said, ""it's not my thing"". Pffft - more hammock for me!The hammock and stand come with a carrying case, too. I don't imagine I'll be transporting my hammock any where, but it does indeed break down easily and fits in a very nice little bag if you want to hammock somewhere else. Nice addition.So far, I'm very impressed! I'll update this review at the end of the season and note any flaws or issues, if applicable. For $130 (as of this writing), I'm very happy and look forward to wasting away the summer in this!",1397174400,2014-04-11
5.0,"This is the second 'remote' thermometer that I have evaluated as review samples in recent months and of the two this is significantly better in ease of use and function.What I love about this is the app that you practically need to get the most out of this device is intuitive and far easier to use. The other thermometer I tested had as many features, but was so complicated to use that I almost gave up.Another feature that all of these thermometers share is accuracy. The probes are heavy duty and even the display and control unit is built to withstand the elements.There a few things you need to know because the instruction sheet is scant at best. To be fair, the information is in the sheet, but for some reason is easy to overlook. First, the real instructions are in a tab in the downloadable app. Second, when you go into bluetooth discovery mode you can pair this device to your phone or tablet, but it will not connect. The app does that for you.One other thing that you need to know is this has the same limitations as any bluetooth device. If you wander more than ten meters or there are obstructions between you and the unit you can drop the signal. That is not a flaw in this thermometer - it's part of the bluetooth specification. I tested the unit for distance and mine actually held for about twelve meters, so there is a little wiggle-room built in.I tested this with both a Galaxy Note 3 phone and a Tab 3 10.1 tablet. Both worked perfectly.Other things I love about this include the ability to use set temperatures for either gourmet or USDA for various meats and doneness, or set your own. And the ease of cleaning the probes after each use.Overall I am thrilled with this set. I know that borders on hyperbole, but that is truly how I feel. If you barbeque or grill outside and own a smartphone I strongly recommend this thermometer set.",1403740800,2014-06-26
4.0,"I think any experienced bird feeding hobbyist could take one look at this feeder and realize it is not squirrel proof, so I'm really not rating it on that aspect.  The cap on which the squirrel-proof claim rests has so far kept squirrels from going in through the top, but only because it's easy enough to access the seed from the feeding ports that they haven't bothered to try lifting the lid.  They can only get a little bit at a time, but my squirrels are oh-so patient and are content taking as long as necessary to empty a feeder.However, I have a more accessible hopper style feeder nearby of which the squirrels are big fans, so I am able to use this one with a fair amount of success.  The birds really do seem to like the U-shaped perches better than the straight perches on my actually squirrel-proof feeders (Brome 1024 Squirrel Buster Plusand Brome's similar peanut feeder), and this feeder is hands-down more attractive.  For twenty bucks it is not, of course, actually made of antique copper, but it does give the appearance and is a pretty yard decoration.  Time will tell whether the copper finish will age nicely, and I have low expectations for the plastic windows which, in my experience, take about one season to become scratched and cloudy.  For now, though, I am enjoying this feeder a lot and the price is reasonable enough that it won't break my heart if it doesn't hold its looks for multiple seasons.  It is sturdy and I expect it will continue to work, so I'll just move it to a less visible spot in the yard if that happens.",1368316800,2013-05-12

3.0,"Received this in record time however I should have known better than to order in mid July!  There's really no time for a tomato or pepper plant to mature to fruit before winter in Pennsylvania.  So I packed those ""pots"" away for next spring.As for the herbs I did put in the ground - some have started to sprout but I must say I'm disappointed with the packaging of the pots.  It was hard to pull off the labels on top and, of course, the dirt shook around.  The first thing I noticed were some seeds laying on top and not buried.  So I fixed them, put the biodegradable pots in the ground and started to sprinkle.  Well each pot has a very noticeable hole, 3 of them actually, where the seeds WERE....out of 7 pots, 2 sprouted.  The remainder are doing nothing so I fear the seeds either ""floated away"" with the mist or they fell out somewhere.  Probably not the best thing for planting. Grab a packet of seeds and put in a pot or garden box - it's the same thing.",1374451200,2013-07-22
3.0,"We've been using earlier versions of Deer Off with regular success in protecting lilies and hostas from deer for some time. The Deer Off III version contains the same basic repellent ingredients (putrescent egg products and pepper extracts) as its predecessors, and provides similar protection.You'll want to avoid contact with the liquid in this container. While it won't make you gag, rotten eggs are a principal ingredient, and it certainly isn't a scent you'll relish contact with.Now, about the battery-powered sprayer. In short, it's rather silly. Mine did not work with batteries it shipped with. The motor ran, but didn't deliver any fluid to the approximately three feet of tubing that extends from the container. The enclosed instructions suggested replacing the OEM batteries with new ones. This solved the problem, and I was soon spraying with battery-powered delight. Which leads to the question: is this necessary? I think not. Havahart has conventional trigger-sprayer version of this product in 16, 32 and 128 ounce sizes: consider one of these instead and stop worrying about the batteries.The included instructions for the battery sprayer deserve a prize for one of the most obvious safety tips ever presented: ""Never place the nozzle in your mouth"".  Always good advice when the nozzle is connected to a container full of liquified rotten eggs!",1344729600,2012-08-12

5.0,"One of those products that again, makes you wonder, ""What took them so long?"" When you hear of how many people have had heart attacks shoveling snow, this just seems like one of those ""obvious"" inventions. Not everyone has enough space to warrant purchasing a huge snow blower so well, what to do? We grabbed this machine the first year it came out and boy, has it been awesome! We've been bad too - blowing more inches that it was supposed to at at time but no matter, this guy just keeps on going! But one of the best things we've noticed is that it really comes in handy when looking for something for your elderly grandmother or grandparents to use. You just plug the thing in and go! No more worrying about them falling on the ice and snow, this thing just pushes like a vacuum cleaner and they have clear steps. Of course, you can do it yourself to really make sure but sometimes, that isn't possible in snowy weather. The kids think they're pretty fun too - they don't mind helping out with the shoveling when you have this thing around.  It shoots snow 12 feet into the all, making it look like a blizzard.  Lots of giggles on that!  But make sure you keep them out of the way of it though - too easy to pick up projectiles if you're not careful.All-in-all, this machine is really a lifesaver, one that we've appreciated for the past 10 years.

5.0,"I used this garden soil in my flower beds since I am not sure I want any nitrates in my vegetable garden yet.  It comes in the standard 1 cubic foot bag like other soils which helps it to stack well with the rest of my garden bags.  I followed the directions on the bag making a 3 inch layer of this garden soil and working it into the top 6 inches of my top soil.  The directions are slightly different for raised beds or for individual plants. But basically it ends up being a 50/50 mixed of this garden soil and your top soil.  I like that the nitrogen, phosphate, calcium and sulphate ingredients are coated which allows them to slowly release over time.  I think this may help them not to pollute the ground water and that makes it good for the environment. My flowers have already grown a noticeable 25% or more which has really helped to make my house look great.  Since they are still growing, by the time growing season is over I hope to get twice the growth like the bag says will happen..  I may need to adjust something in my soil preparation or watering.  I will keep experimenting.  But I am super pleased with the nice flowers I have now already.  I would recommend this soil for anyone wanting to more growth from their plants without trying to wade through the confusing world of fertilizers since the ratio of nutrients are already figured out for you in the bag.",1396742400,2014-04-06

2.0,"I hate gas powered tools! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem. Obstacles are a definite problem. The maneuverability is quite limited. With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great!

4.0,"We have several hanging bird feeders in our backyard (the squirrels love them!) and so I thought I'd try a change of pace and put a few hummingbird feeders out, too. Perky-Pet makes a line of beautiful antique bottle hummingbird feeders. These feeders come in a variety of colors (clear, red, green and blue) and are made of real glass bottles which screw (upside-down) into a two-piece metal/plastic base. A sturdy metal wire hanger is attached for easy hanging. I have several wrought iron shepherd staff hanging poles that we also use for hanging plants; this Perky-Pet feeder's wire hanger slipped easily onto the shepherd staff.This product only comes with cleaning instructions which are printed on a detachable tag in English, Portuguese and French. Anything else you may want to know about hummingbirds and how and what to feed them must be derived from your own research. Just Google it!According to my research, hummingbirds are attracted to bright colors. Except for the Perk-Pet red bottle, these feeders are color wise rather dull; pretty, but dull. The only bright color on my green-bottle feeder is the four red flower-like feeding ports attached to the top of the saucer-shaped base. The top of the base is chrome and the bottom is a dull brownish color. Whether or not this hummingbird feeder has enough bright color to attract hummingbirds remains to be seen.These 24-ounce antique bottle feeders are designed to be hung up but may also be placed standing up on a flat surface. I found out that Perky-Pet also sells hummingbird nectar. It comes as a concentrate so all that is necessary is to add water (makes 48 ounces). It's fairly reasonable, but making hummingbird nectar at home is so easy and much less expensive. Just Google it for a simple recipe and instructions. Besides its attractive appearance, one of the best characteristics of the Perky-Pet feeder is, unlike the plastic kind, it doesn't leak! This is a real plus because leaking hummingbird feeders attacked wasps and other bothersome stinging insects.It probably comes as no surprise that hummingbirds are fragile animals. Taking care to keep your feeders clean is essential for their survival. This Perky-Pet feeder is very easy to clean; just screw off the bottle from the base and separate the two halves of the saucer-shaped base for easy washing. The feeder care instructions that come with this product read in English as follows:""FEEDER CARE: Hand wash with warm water and soap twice a week. If extra cleaning is required, a solution of vinegar and water should be used.""A Perky-Pet Antique Bottle Hummingbird Feeder will look great on any patio, balcony, garden, is easy to refill and clean, and doesn't leak. My only recommendation to Perky-Pet would be the addition of more information about hummingbirds. This feeder is manufactured with parts made in China and assembled in the USA. It retails new for around $20. Recommended.",1370304000,2013-06-04

4.0,"I've been using a cordless Earthwise model for the past few years, and it's finally showing its age, so we switched over to this one.  All in all, the Green Works seems like a step up, at least in power and battery life.  In exchange, it's definitely heavier.  The Earthwise I could use until the battery ran down, a good 45 minutes.  My arms are feeling the weight of this one before a half hour is up.Pros: Battery life.  I've gone more than 45 minutes with this on one charge, ample time to get through the yard and driveway areas.  It's very convenient to be able to get the job done on one charge.  It handles grass and low-level weeds very well (however, we have one section in the back that had overgrown with scotchbroom, wild peas and some thicker weeds, and the Greenworks couldn't keep up).  It also adjusts well - I am on the short side and my husband is 6'4"", and we can both use this trimmer easily.  The rotating head for edging is also a nice touch, something our previous trimmer did not have.  It's handy for going along the driveway.Cons: The heft.  I definitely feel the muscle fatigue in the arm with this one.  Also, I have yet to master trading out the spool.  It always takes me three or more tries to get everything fed through correctly.  Our Earthwise model was much easier in this department.Overall, it's a solid battery-powered unit with plenty of power for most jobs.  I'd recommend it.",1369699200,2013-05-28

It appears to be of fairly good quality but the  unmistakable touch of a product of China, for one example, is the plastic plate that is supposed to fit on the handle. It does not fit on my mower. This is not an item necessary for the mower to cut grass but I just mention it to illustrate the lack of manufacturing precision that is inherent in some other country's products. There are other examples but not sufficient to detail. If other Fiskar products are  also now being manufactured in China then it is adios Fiskars for me.I received this mower from the Vine program and it does a fairly decent job of cutting grass.

This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.

The stated purpose of having a battery in this product is so that it sucks up the water that you squeegee off, but is that really necessary? I don't think so.  I used it and found it no better than using glass cleaner and a paper towel.  I also used it to clean my bathtub (I like to clean the tub after each use and leave it dry to prevent mildew, and this does the trick).

4.0,"The reason I got this product was to get my cucumbers up off the ground, as they tend to take over a lot of territory otherwise.  (See my note below on how I stake my tomatoes.)As stated in some of the other reviews, I agree that the five-foot stakes that come with this product are pretty short, but I love how this design works. The product is designed so that you can place the cross supports anywhere you want.  They don't have to be three in one location as shown in the picture.  If you need to move one cross-support up or down to accommodate a heavier, fruit-bearing branch, just do it.By the way, if you think that that 5-foot stakes will be too short, the stakes that come with this are the same standard green metal rods covered in green plastic that you can buy at any garden center.  So -- if you want more than 4 feet of stake showing above the ground, you can get longer green stakes at a garden center and use the three 5-foot stakes that come with this unit somewhere else.  The cross-supports will clip on the longer stakes in exactly the same way and you'll still be able to adjust them as needed.The bottom line is I love the simplistically clever design.  If you cage tomatoes, these are a good alternative to regular wire cages.  I just wouldn't use them with any plant that gets TOO heavy or has to withstand high winds.  As for my own personal use, this product will work just fine for my cucumbers.**RE: Tomatoes -- After many years of trial and error, I now stake my tomatoes using a single 2x2x8 pounded one-foot deep about 5 or 6 inches from the plant, then pinch off all suckers, tying up the main vine along the stake as the vine grows.  Using the single stake method is, by far, the best I've found for better production on tomato plants.  I also get more plants in less garden space, and it's easier to work around them, too. Cages were always a pain -- falling over with heavy growth, bending in high wind, and breaking.  I learned the single-stake method from a tomato grower who moved here from Romania, and after a bit of online research I learned that commercial tomato growers use similar methods in greenhouses, hanging strings from the greenhouse ceiling.  Because I don't have huge greenhouse, I tried the 2x2x8 single stake method--with great results.  That said, if I was told I had to use a cage, I would choose the Ultomato cage design over traditional wire cages, as the modular design provides greater flexibility to change/adjust the set-up as the plant grows.",1367193600,2013-04-29

4.0,"I am not an outdoors-type person. One of the main reasons for my distaste is the constant barrage of bugs landing on me, biting me and making me itch. I have tried many bug sprays in the past and while they worked to a point, I was always left sticky, smelly and not 100% protected. It seemed like a lot of hassle to just be outside. My answer is to always choose the indoor activity.I decided to give Cutter a chance. It went on less wet than others. I suppose I was expecting it to go on like a powder but it wasn't quite that dry. It did evaporate fast and didn't leave me feeling sticky. The smell wasn't something I would choose in a perfume, but it wasn't as chemical as others that I've tried. It also didn't linger quite as much.I found it to do a decent job with the bugs. I feel like I must be like candy to mosquitos. They will pass by all others in my family to go right for me. The spray worked more for them than me. However, I do not follow the suggestions of wearing light colored, loose clothing either. So this might have something more to do with it.All in all, this worked better than others for me and I'd choose to purchase it if I was looking at a shelf of choices in the store.",1404518400,2014-07-05

2.0,"My first reaction to this product is that it is very expensive for a single unit. But if it works better than the others, perhaps it is worth it. I bought 2 units and plugged them into different locations in the house. After two weeks of testing, they have only caught 2 mosquitoes and 1 small unidentified bug. I have seen fruit flies cruise right past them and there is still a pesky fly buzzing around my house who seems to have no interest in the traps.In addition, the UV light is rather cheaply and flimsily inserted into it's holder so it moves around and causes a loud buzzing noise which requires you to readjust the light from time to time. The buzzing noise is loud, you will hear it if you are in the same room. Finally, this unit is missing an on/off switch so the ony way to turn it off is to unplug it from the wall and find a place to put it which is ackward because of the sticky tape which slides out very easily and the fragility of the UV tube and the fact that it is not terribly secure in the socket.I realize a good trap is hard to come by and none of them are perfect, it could be that this unit is one of the better ones on the market but at $34 a pop, it just doesn't strike me as good value for money. At this time, I cannot recommend it.I'm debating if I should give Flowtron a try, the only thing holding me back is that it is not designed for indoor use which is what I require.",1299369600,2011-03-06

5.0,"We feed the birds 365 days a year in our back yard. Of course in Ohio we only have to worry about the hummingbirds for the summer but they keep us very busy.The thing with hummingbiords is that you have to change their sugar-water with great frequency, (we replace the sugar-water at least every other day in multiple feeders), for a couple of reasons. The first is that the sugar water will ferment quickly in the high temperatures of summer and you'll make the little fellers drunk if you don't change it out. Second, the sugar water will turn milky in a few days and it's no good for the birds at that point. Some people have trouble with ants accessing the feeder to get the sugar-water but we prevent that with a little Vaseline or axle grease rubbed on the shepherd's hook pole on which the feeder is placed. [Wrap some duct tape on steel poles and put the grease on the tape to help prevent it from melting and running off due to the heat -- re-apply as needed.]This feeder is quite easy to take down, disassemble, clean (you'll need a bottle brush), and fill. You're wasting money if you *buy* the liquid to go in these feeders. Simply make up your sugar-water ahead of time, three parts water and one part sugar, stir it up, microwave it until it is very hot and fully dissolved, and then cool it before pouring it into the feeder bottle. If you want it to be red, (which attracts the hummingbirds), just add a drop or two of red food coloring to the blend. Keep a couple days' supply in reserve in your refrigerator.This feeder has a nice antique look and it functions just fine -- we like it a lot.Highly recommended.",1340841600,2012-06-28

3.0,"ON the positive first, this planter is what it says- a hanger for potted plants so that one can mount on rails or other horizontal surfaces. The paint and fittings appear to be weather resistant- so I don't anticipate anything rusting out.  The wire frame is heavy enough to adequately support a pot, soil and plant.  The mounting system is designed well, I hung this on my deck rail and feel comfortable it will be good there.  It looks nice and the black color I choose doesn't conflict with anything.The negative is in the hardware.  I don't want to be too insulting, but it literally looks like someone at the factory said, ""hey, we've got a bunch of these- use them!""The hardware consist of flat head slotted screws that come up through the bottom of the part of the frame that goes over the rail.  That seems like a good idea, except the bottom of the frame is an non-camferred slot- so the screws stick out.  The nuts on top are plastic acorn nuts that don't have a metal inside.  This makes them easy to cross thread, easy to over tighten and generally, difficult to deal with.  It seems to me that a combination of a carriage bolt (so you didn't have to hold the bottom, it would hold itself) and a better nut could have made this so much easier to deal with.So, maybe what I'm saying is that this is a perfectly acceptable hanger- but that its harder to deal with then it should be.",1368144000,2013-05-10

4.0,"As you can see from the original review, I had my reservations but overall, Greenworks has a decent product.  As it turns out, the weak battery life ended up being a DEAD battery after less than 6 months.  Greenworks customer service was contacted with no mention of Vine participation.  They handled the issue very quickly and professionally, exceeding my expectations (some other reviews report less than satisfactory experiences)  After trying the new battery, I can say that it performs better than the prior one, but still goes to 2 bars within about ~15 minutes.Original review from October 2013 below....I have a Black and Decker corded electric blower/vac, and it's supposedly rated at 225 mph.  This, at 185 mph seems every bit as powerful.  The aur speed is like the PSI on a pressure washer - it can be a little misleading.  If you get a large amount of air at 185 mph, it can be more functional than a small stream of air at 225 mph.It's a little heavier than my corded blower, but the convenience far outweighs this.1) There's an odd little nozzle extension that I decided I didn't need - this also gives the blower a larger exhaust.2) Using the extra power mode eats your battery pretty darn quick. My guess is that it will last less than 15 minutes on the high setting.  That should be enough for most jobs, however.3) Charger is annoying - you have to push hard to get it to click in, then removing it is also very tricky since you have tu simultaneously release the latch which is now upside down, and pull away from you.  My wife was unable to do this after several tries.4) On/off and high/low switches are really low cost ""membrane"" switches - very small and hard to use with gloves.  I also don't know how well they will hold up over time.  They really should have gone with something bigger and more robust.",1381363200,2013-10-10

5.0,"I've been feeding birds for almost the last twenty years, and I've continued to look for the perfect feeder during that whole time.  This sturdy all-metal feeder is close though not perfect.  Most notably it doesn't actually deter squirrels entirely as advertised, but it DOES discourage them.The feeder is very solidly constructed, very heavy, all-metal, and the hanging loop is just the right size to fit on the hook of my bird-feeding post, with the loop snug enough so local racoons can't pull it off.  The design does not allow for a post-mount.The design works by placing a metal grid over the sunflower seed (about an inch deep).  You pour seed into the feeder, shift the grid around so it's sitting on top of the seed, and voila!  The birds on top of the grid can put their beaks through to get seeds from the bottom of the feeder but squirrels can't quite reach the bottom with their little arms.  Unless you overfill the feeder, in which case the squirrels can reach from the sides of the grid.The problem that makes this feeder not truly squirrel-proof is that if a squirrel sits on one edge, the feeder tilts, the seed slides to that side, and the squirrel can now reach the heaped seed.  My squirrels discovered this technique within just a few days.Even so, the squirrels aren't able to get to ALL of the seed...just much of it.  So it slows down your seed disappearing, and it is extra work for the squirrels, so they don't park on the feeder quite the way they would with an unprotected one.  So squirrel-discouragement rather than squirrel-deterrence.Note you can't put mixed seed in this feeder, it is designed for sunflower ONLY.  Mixed seed quickly clogs the mesh bottom.I give this 5 stars because it's a great feeder for sunflower, but solely as a squirrel-proof feeder, I'd give it only 3.5 stars.  Recommended, but don't expect to defeat the squirrels; at best you'll slow them down.UPDATE FEB 2014: More than 6 years later, this feeder is still going strong despite having been outside near continuously through harsh winters, hot summers, thunderstorms, nor'easters and occasional hurricanes, and having harbored lots of birds, a number of squirrels, and even some racoons. The grate is still solid and intact, the metal shows some weathering but is still in good shape (no damage).I've pressure-washed it a couple of times and had to retighten the nut that holds the whole thing together every 2 years.  That bolt/nut connects the bottom of the feeder to the hook in the top, and slowly works loose over time. When it has worked loose enough, it has come apart under a racoon's weight 2-3x-- but no damage from falling to the ground, and the nut/bolt didn't even strip from that rough treatment. Definitely a good, solid feeder worth its premium price.  Highly recommended, I'd buy another.",1190160000,2007-09-19
3.0,"The Bodum Fyrkat 13.4"" Grill is a great little grill for backyard/camping grilling.  It has a rubber-coated handle as well as rubber coated grill cover clamps - which can come in handy when around hot steel.  In addition to Orange, the Fyrkat also comes in three other colors for those people who are tired of the basic black.  The lid handle also turns to actuate the air vents in the lid which is a nice feature.  The charcoal platform/ash collector is removable to allow for separate cleaning.  This should theoretically allow for the interior to stay extremely clean, since the charcoal bits will fall into a separate compartment, and not the bottom of the grill as with a Weber model, but so far I haven't been able to figure out how to remove this piece w/o some of the burned charcoal rolling off into the bottom of the grill.  Guess I need more practice.Big drawback and why I've lowered it to 3 Stars is that the grill is very expensive.  List price is $94.99 which is REALLY high considering comparable portable grills such as the much cheaper Weber 10020 Smokey Joe Silver Charcoal Grill (lists at $34.70, Amazon sells at $29.70) or Weber's upgrade model the 40020 Smokey Joe Gold Charcoal Grill (lists at $39.70, Amazon sells at $34.70).  Considering I see little difference in actual operation and function between the Bodum and Weber grills (especially between the Fyrkat and the Smokey Joe Silver - both of which I now own), I'm wondering what you are paying for in the additional $60.  The rubber-coated devices, although a really nice touch, and a little higher quality construction can't be worth almost 200% more can it?Good grill, but unless the color variations and rubber-coated handles really do it for you, seems like a little pricey for a backyard/camping/tailgate grill - unless you are using it to cook your Salmon and Bris...******** UPDATE **********(9 July, 2012) Word to the wise - DO NOT LOSE ANY PART OFF THIS GRILL!!!  I recently left the grill top at a park after a cookout and after looking around Bodum's website and after several calls to their customer service line, I learned that they DO NOT sell replacement grill tops (or for that matter, any kind of spare parts).  One guy took my name and number and said that he'd call me back if they took a grill on return (still hearing crickets chirping...).  So now I am left with a charcoal grill that I already thought was somewhat pricey but now it has no cooktop.  Of course, Bodum's kettle is a non-standard diameter so no other brand makes a grating that perfectly fits into the space (not even Webber and their many different sized options) so I'm left with either improvising a cooktop that doesn't fit or retrofitting the interior of the kettle to make the replacement grate that I bought fit.  I chose the former and went with a larger grill that we can lay over the kettle - and - we've only used it once since.  A crying shame...******** UPDATE **********(27 March, 2014) Bodum is in the process of discontinuing this product and has increased the price to $94.99.  I've updated my review to reflect this new price.",1279756800,2010-07-22

I like the fact that it has a tank for water storage, no need to hook it up to a water faucet with a hose. The solar power is a great idea, but it does need to be placed at a place with good sun exposure ot make it work, and the battery strength indicator tells you whether the battery is strong or weak, a great feature.

5.0,"Be patient and try cheddar cheese.  Our story: I kinda felt bad about killing the little buggers, but they had been eating our tomatoes and pestering our pets. THEY HAD TO GO. Being the soft-hearted person I am, I felt mechanical traps had the potential of being cruel, as did rat poisons (never mind the smell of decaying rat bodies), and we don't have a pet store who would take trapped rats as snake food because they were wild. It took over a week for the first kill. We were watching and saw the rat enter the trap. He/she simply died. No death throes. No sparks. No smoke. Just sudden, instantaneous death. The rat's tail didn't even so much as twitch. If you have problems getting your rats to go inside, you must be patient. Ours went after cheddar cheese chunks--not peanut butter, not bananas, not tomatoes, not dog food, not chicken, not sunflower seeds, not even oatmeal. Try to touch the bait as little as possible. Try setting a big chunk in the very back of the chamber and a smaller one just in front of the zapper pad. Then just walk away. Just walk away. Leave it alone. Don't move it, don't touch it, don't breathe on it. The red light will flash when you need to check it.

2.0,"PLEASE SEE THE UPDATE AFTER THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW.We have been plagued with squirrels for years.  Our neighborhood has vast numbers of large oak and pecan trees with a smattering of fruit trees.  These provide food and shelter for these little critters so they multiply like crazy and typically overrun the area.  They dig up flower beds, destroy container plants, dig holes in the lawn and devour one small bite out of every pecan and piece of fruit before it matures.  If that's not bad enough, they have chewed through the wood trim on our home and made nests in the attic.  Squirrels are NOT cute little cartoon critters.  They are destructive tree rats.  Over the years, I've tried to keep them at bay by using various home remedy methods--from putting ground red pepper around plants to using a pellet gun to permanently remove individuals.  Nothing worked.  They liked hot pepper and for every one I killed, three more would take its place.With this in mind, I was skeptical of ""Deer Off"".  But I was willing to give it a try and I actually think it may be working...at least for the short term.  After spraying a liberal amount of ""Deer Off"" around the base of trees, in flower beds and around container plants, the squirrels seem to be staying away.  It's been a little under two weeks since the initial application of the product and I've only seen one squirrel at a time in the back yard.  In the past, they came in gangs of more than a dozen--sometimes as many as two dozen at one time.  So far so good.The label says ""Deer Off"" deters animals by smell and taste but it is odorless to humans ""once dry"".  I never noticed an odor as I sprayed it and I have a pretty sensitive nose.  It's also supposed to last for months even after rain or watering of plants.  I can't verify this but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  If there's anything I dislike about the product it is the silly battery-powered sprayer container.  I've noticed this trend in lawn care products recently and I don't like it.  Batteries and battery-powered pumps add an unnecessary expense to the products, they add unnecessary complications should electrical components fail and they add unnecessary waste to landfills.  It's not difficult to pump up a sprayer and let air do the work.  And, of course, air is free.  In my opinion, the advent of battery-powered sprayers is a dumb marketing idea that should be rectified as soon as possible.I'm giving ""Deer Off"" four stars due to my short term observation that it appears to be working with the local squirrels.  Docked one star permanently for the battery-powered sprayer.UPDATE 06/12/2012:I guess I was too optimistic.  The squirrels are back.  Digging in the lawn, digging in the flower beds and digging in the plant containers.Yeah, that didn't last too long.  No big rains to wash it away either.  It just quit working.  And at over 30 bucks for the large bottle, I can't recommend it as a temporary solution.",1338681600,2012-06-03

4.0,"This feeder is easy to fill and holds about 3 pounds of mixed bird seed per fill.  The adjustment springs are easily accessible and simple to operate.  Lengthening or stretching the spring increases the weight required to close off the feed ports and shortening the spring by hooking it in the highest adjustment hole causes the feed ports to close with less weight on the perches.I hung my feeder on a 6' tall shepherds hook well clear of tree branches and no squirrels have been able to get at it.  I have set my feeder on the shortest spring travel in an effort to keep flocks of blackbirds from emptying the feeder before the smaller birds get a chance to eat, and that worked for about 10 minutes - - - until the large birds discovered they could support their weight on the flange at the bottom of the feeder with one foot and grab the wire of the sliding cage with the other.  When 2 or 3 blackbirds do this they can feed until they are full.  If more birds land on the perches, the ports do close and all the birds leave, but then they return and repeat the process.  It slows the blackbirds down but does not stop them, so only 4 stars.This feeder does work well with cardinals, song sparrows, chickadees and similar birds when not harassed by the larger more aggressive birds.  I believe the flange around the bottom of the feeder would allow squirrels to get at the feed as easily as the blackbirds did however, if the feeder was placed in a location accessible to the squirrels.",1364428800,2013-03-28

4.0,"I wanted a small, light mower, and I didn't want to have to deal with a gasoline engine. I was a little wary of the small deck size, and I was wary overall of the battery powered mower, but I had no interest in a corded electric mower. This mower seemed to be a good fit. Here's what I found:Pros:It's so light. It's so easy to move around when mowing and easy to put away.It mows pretty well.It's very quiet.I've not had any problems like some other reviewers reported with the mower knocking itself onto lower height settings when backing it up.Cons:- The battery is advertised at 10,000 sq. ft. That's .23 acres. I am telling you right now there is NO WAY you are mowing 1/4 acre with this battery unless maybe if you have a perfectly manicured flat yard. My lot is about 6,000 sq ft. Take out the house and the sidewalk and I'm under 5000 sq ft. The problem is that the 10,000 sq. ft. is for the &#34;Intellicut&#34; mode, not the &#34;heavy&#34; mode. With that mode the mower died before I finished my front yard, which is probably a little less than a third of my lot, so maybe 1,500 sq ft. Obviously that mode is going to draw more power, but I was disappointed at how fast it died. It's just enough battery for my yard, but I am a little disappointed in it.- The deck size is so small it's really easy to miss spots. You should already be expecting this, but it is difficult.- The bag is super-small. Again, this shouldn't be a surprise. Just set it to mulching mode. The problem is if you get a lot of rain and the grass gets a little out of control before you get a chance to mow, it's too high to mulch, and you have to empty the bag a billion times. Also there is a little orange tab which tells you when the bag is full, and it keeps falling off.- The mower gets bounced around a bit on lump lawns.- The only con which is something I wasn't really expecting is that it seems like it just missed cutting some taller blades of grass. Specifically crabgrass. The blade just doesn't spin that fast on Intellicut mode, and after mowing my lawn I always find some wisps of grass popping back up. It's a little annoying.I know I talked a lot more about the cons, but all in all I really like this mower. I would not recommend it if you have 1/4 acre to mow. With the deck size and the battery, it's just going to drive you nuts. I would definitely recommend this mower for folks who have five or six thousand square feet to mow. It takes a little extra time with the small deck, but it's so easy to move it around.",1369094400,2013-05-21

It's super lightweight, the fabric is gorgeous and it is very stylish to look at and comfortable to pick up and carry, and I loved the concept of an expanding hose. If I had a patio or townhouse garden and needed a hose, this would be among my top picks.However, the issue here is one of quality. The fittings are plastic and feel like a flimsy plastic to boot, the fabric is not heavy-duty by any means, and other reviewers have noted problems with its longevity. It also is not meant to be safe for drinking out of, which is fine, but should certainly be noted as that was a major factor for me the last time I bought a hose.

That is saving me from having to re-fill this as fast as I have had to fill some other supposedly ""squirrel proof feeders"".The mechanism on the bottom where the food come out is very clever in that it tilts and provides no way for the squirrel to hang on for more than a few moments before dropping to the ground.

4.0,"This expandable weathered wood finish window planter is perfect for anyone who wants to get a head start on herbs on a window sill. Its hinges open to give 5 compartments for planting. Each is lined with a thin plastic so that soil stays put and water damage to the wood, or any underlying surfaces, is minimized. There is no outlet for drainage so keep that in mind when deciding what to try to grow. The largest compartment on the top measures about 8 1/2 by 3 1/4 inches with the other 4 smaller ones at 4 by 3 1/4 inches. When fully opened, the planter is about 23 inches long and stands 7 1/2 inches high. It could also be used for small flowering plants, catnip, or small succulents.I planted some seed of herbs for transplanting outside when the snow melts and placed it on a sunny windowsill. This is a great alternative to my usual sundry assortment of plastic seedling pots!",1363996800,2013-03-23

Setting this to the largest setting, using one nut/bolt on each bracket, it was a perfect fit.  The support bumper rests perfectly against the slats on the deck, and the planter inserted is level.  I may have to insert a screw on each bracket to anchor it more securely to the decking, but I'm not too happy about having to do that on a older 1"" piece of wood.  The planter I put in was one of the smaller ones I own, that dries out quickly, and not too heavy when soaked, so I figured it would be a good first test.  I will experiment with heavier boxes down the line.  Honestly, I don't see this lasting too long, since it is less than sturdy.  But for now, it does it's job well.

This Quantum Hand Lopper is replacing a Lopper I had that a neighbor ""permanently borrowed"" :)Fiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper- my fault for lending because they are so amazing that there are always more projects to do with them.  My other Loppers were over 8 years old and holding strong .... but they have found a new home.That said, I decided to try the Cadillac of Loppers!  That would be these, the Quantum Hand Lopper by Fiskars.  This one is different.  It's different with it's cork coated handle that absorbs some of the shock and it's light materials.  The mechanism is flawless and it cuts branches and small trees (2"" max) like butter.  The leverage these type of loppers provide is amazing.  The handle takes some of the shock out of the last phase of each cut.  These really are a lighter option too ... and that makes for an easier lopping experience when you are doing it for several cuts.These are superb and you are going to pay for that.  If you take your pruning seriously and need the best tool to lop, buy these.  They are nearly 4X more expensive than others but you do get what you pay for.  Made in Finland with lighter materials and patented gearing technology that multiplies your effort.Fantastic!",1377129600,2013-08-22
4.0,"I'm writing this review from the perspective of a fairly sedentary woman (i.e. not strong). Overall, I really liked the Black & Decker Corded Mower with Edge Max. It's quiet, easy to push and mows neatly. I got this mower out of the box, assembled--and mowed my entire front yard--within an hour!When I first opened the box, I was horrified--it looked like nothing was put together. I slowly began to assemble the grass catcher, and voila, I was able to lift the (assembled) mower out of the box WITH ONE HAND! It's quite light. Once the grass catcher is assembled, the rest goes pretty fast.However, while assembling the mower, I was disgusted with Black & Decker for their low standards: pieces that should have snapped together relatively easily took so much strength because of misaligned parts. They're like the opposite of LEGOs--pieces do *not* fit like a glove. In face, I needed a butter knife to help me push pieces together--more than once. I had to do both butt & chest presses on the grass catcher to have a couple of pieces finally snap into place. Thank goodness I did this in the privacy of my living room. I was sweating because of so much physical exertion (not the worst thing, mind you) to get that grass catcher put together correctly. Seriously, B&D;: Try Harder!Keep in mind: this does not come with a extension cord, so if you want to mow immediately, make sure you have a long one ready.The mower is so easy to push and control. I have used both gas power mowers and push mowers. This electric mower was the most pleasant mowing experience for me by far. The power one is hard for me to keep up with, and weights about as much as me. The push mower I used, a Fiskars mowers, was entirely abysmal: very hard to push and left your lawn looking like a terrible haircut.The one caveat I have is this: cords are a pain! Not just on this mower, but on all corded mowers. If I had the means, I'd totally buy an electric mower run on a battery. But for this low price, if you have the patience for a cord, this is a total deal. Drape the cord over your shoulder and not around your neck. Live and learn.",1398816000,2014-04-30

5.0,"Setting this trap is as easy as lifting up a handle. Releasing what you've caught is just as easy. The paddle sensitivity is right for the larger creatures this trap is meant for. I've not had any luck catching the vegetarians in my yard. I'm talking about groundhogs and rabbits. It seems they are too cautious to enter the trap. I've tried all kinds of fresh veggies (assorted greens, tomatoes, carrots, celery, etc.) without any catches.  Meat-eaters, mainly skunks where I live, are another story. They go right for the left over meat or dog food I use as bait for them.Transporting and releasing a skunk is bit of a chore but is not as difficult as I would have thought. I approach the trap while holding a blanket or similar type of shield. As soon as I'm close enough I drop the blanket over the trap, pick it up by the handle (which is underneath the blanket), and put it in the back of my truck. At the release sight I lift the blanket so one end of the trap is not covered. I then lift the handle, taking care that it engages, and step back from the trap. The skunk scampers away without incident. If I move the trap around too much, the skunk will spray but the blanket catches the liquid. The odor, as you would expect, is awful. Most of the time skunks will spray while they are getting bounced around in the back of my truck.",1371686400,2013-06-20

5.0,"This grill is very simple to set up and use, and we have grilled chicken on and off the bone, lamb, sausages, fish, vegetables, shrimp and scallops, and have also baked potatoes and sweet potatoes with success. However, the grill is somewhat limited by the amount of heat that can be generated by an approximately 1500 Watt element. So, you would not necessarily have the best of luck preparing food that requires very high heat or an actual flame. You also do not have the option, of course of using smoke woods as flavoring.

I was hopeful that many of the seemingly obvious design problems in the original had been addressed, but sadly, this sequel is more of the same.In fact, the only thing that's really notable over its predecessor, is that this works out of the box (the original needed to be left outside for a day or two to charge). Other than that, the top still inexplicably pops off of the base, getting any sort of accuracy out of the spray head is a bridge too far, and the tank empties out much faster than expected.Where it does excel, intentionally or not, is that the noise of the activated sprinkler is enough to scare animals away before a drop of water hits fur.

5.0,"There are usually numerous fire ant mounds in my horse pastures and all over my lawn in the summer. It has gotten so much worse over the last few years that I had vowed to do something about it. At the beginning of the summer I treated the visible nests, mounds, hills, whatever you want to call the forts from which the fire ants attack humans - just kidding, sort of. I should have remembered that treating the home of the ants will get rid of them by driving them down and over to another location unless you go deep with the treatment.So I was clipping a hedge in my front flowerbed when my legs started stinging horribly. I looked down and there were fire ants all over my legs and ankles, all the way up to the knees. I was standing in the middle of a mound the size of my kitchen table - about four feet in diameter. After swatting and smacking and dancing around and taking my shoes off and banging them on the ground, I got rid of the ants, but of course not before they had bitten me in about 20 or 30 places. The bites itched so badly I was nearly wild with a need to tear my skin off. The expected little blisters full of venom formed shortly after and I won't go into what I went through for two days after that.As the sun rose on the third day, I picked up my bag of Terro Ant Killer and, with a grim gleam in my eye, I made my way to the enemy lines. It was all over pretty quickly. I shook out the Terro and wet it down with the hose. The bag would have done a larger area, but I wanted it to saturate and go down as far as the ant tunnels reached so I used all 3 pounds of it. After a couple of days I was assured the mound was neutralized  and I have yet to see another eruption in the lawn, the pastures or the flower beds.Again, the key to fighting ants is to go deep. Just destroying the ones outside the nest or even a couple of inches down is only going to make them divide to conquer. Terro seems to do the job.",1374019200,2013-07-17

We spread this stuff around some plants that require lots of water.  The water attracted slugs.  There was a slug convention on these particular plants.  Since we did not authorize the convention, we decided to rain on the slugs' parade in the form of Dr. T's Slug and Snail Killer.It took little time for the slugs to start dropping like...slugs (you thought I was going to say flies, I bet).  The little pests keeled over quickly, forming plant fertilizer in the process.  Life seemed to be heading in the right direction.Then we noticed that our plants had little holes in them where we sprinkled the slug and snail killer.  In fairness to the slug and snail killer, our plants were quite dense (probably forming slug habitat).  So, some of the slug and snail killer remained on the plants for a lengthy period.  At the same time, we entered a period of dry weather.  Therefore, there are many things that may have contributed to the formation of holes in our plants.You may also wonder just what kind of plants these are.  Sadly, I do not know the formal name.  Plants that like to be wet, is what I call them.  So, if you use this stuff and you are using it on plants that are outside the mainstream, the mainstream being roses, petunias, cucumbers, and the like, then you might want to test this stuff first.The bottom line:  I give this stuff accolades for killing slugs.

Our original bench sits outside on our deck in direct afternoon sun and is holding up very well (the bench is only slightly protected from rain by a bit of an overhanging eave).  The finish on the bench is very attractive, and the bench itself is so sturdy and easy to put together that we decided to buy a second bench to use inside our house in an enclosed walkway between our house and our garage.I also recommend the cushion for the Strathwood three seater bench (we bought the Pearwood color - a nice green - the first time around, but this time we're purchasing the less expensive Neutral color). The 20 inch accent cushions in Pearwood are also very nice, and while they seem tough enough for outdoor use, we only leave them out on weekends when they see the most use.  Important: Strathwood's price on this bench and the two seater bench have radically changed (up and down) over the span of a few months, so for the best deal track the price over the course of several weeks.  For instance, just before Christmas 2008 this bench was under 100, then after the holidays it jumped to nearly twice that (170, I think).  Right now, it's slightly above the Christmas price, which is why we're buying another one.  Recommended!",1246924800,2009-07-07

3.0,"A trimmer that's really light weight, mows, and is cordless? Fantastic! But...when it works it's great....but it's getting it to work that is the tricky part. It is so light weight that it's great for tiny yards, steep hillsides, or for the elderly or younger kids to use. It's a less dangerousness mini mower with the deck on. You just make sure the lithium battery is completely locked in, push a button and squeeze the handle. As an edger it works well too but with no shields attached watch out for your bare ankles getting hit by debris.The problems: let's start with the battery's. Each battery only lasts 15-20 minutes tops depending upon grass length. So if you have any sizable job it would take you forever to get it done. Especially since each battery then takes about 4 and a half hours to recharge. So 9 hours of charging for 30-40 minutes of work time. Out of the box my husband and I used this as a mower. We each used both batteries once, so there was a recharge between uses. Then I went to recharge the batteries only to get the flashing red light signal that indicated overheating. We tried this off and on for over 24 hours plugging the charger in inside the house. Finally I emailed Black and Decker who responded with a statement that I should be charging them in a cool area ( it was mid May and our house was no warmer than 71) but that since I had a time period I needed to review this in I could take it to their service center an hour away. We went out of our way to get there to be told that this was a known battery problem, they were in a minor redesign and we would have new batteries in about ten days. The new ones finally came- and still when we went to charge them the same overheat signal came on and the batteries wouldn't charge. So another trip to the service center where they finally decided it was the fault of the charger. A new one was ordered. But a second set of batteries showed up instead. So those then had to be mailed back and wait for the charger some more. Now that the waiting game is over the trimmer/ mower is great as long as it has that tiny amount of juice but from my perspective this product still needs a lot of work to make it better for the user.",1402963200,2014-06-17

Actually, that should tell you what kind of inattentive gardener I am. :-)In any case, the Ivy and rosemary grew and rooted after a week or so. The unremembered plant did not do so well. I really wanted the rosemary to grow, so I guess it's all working out fine so far.A couple of hints for those of you who are inexperienced gardeners like myself:1. The instructions say to keep the leave moist by misting them at least once a day.2. Keep the soil very damp until the new plants become very robust.3. Rooting hormone is dangerous to breath, so please wear a dust mask when prepping.Now, I'm off to see what else I can root. Hmmm, I have these 2x4s in the garage &#8230;",1395187200,2014-03-19
3.0,"This is the product for you if you are looking for extreme convenience and results.  It's good soil with some slow-release fertilizer mixed in.  However I'd be more inclined to just get some cheap potting soil at the local garden center and mix it with a cup or so of palm or citrus fertilizer.  You'd save 50% of the cost of this and have a lot more soil at half the price.But as for this soil, I used it on the lemon tree and that tree is very happy.... lots of blooms and fruit on the way.  Miracle Gro knows what they are doing but they charge a premium for that.",1395532800,2014-03-23
3.0,"Disclaimer: Yes, I received these traps for free from Amazon via the Vine program. That being said, I always review products as if I actually paid for them.The Victor M265 Kill and Seal does what it says. It kills mice and seals them into the trap.When using these traps, the thing to remember is that a little bait (peanut butter worked well) goes a long way.To bait the trap you unscrew the bait plug, put a small amount of peanut butter (or whatever you want to use) on the inside of the plug, put the plug back into the trap and screw it in tightly. That's it. And you screw it in tightly to seal the chamber so none of the fleas, ticks or other parasites, along with blood and other body fluids, can seep out.To activate the trap you pull down the red handle and the door opens. Place the trap. Always make sure you put the trap along the base of a wall or similar as this is where the mice frequent. It is very rare for a mouse to travel into the center of a room.I received these a couple days ago. I took the time that evening to bait and set them and literally the next morning I had 2 dead mice.As it states, it kills and seals the mouse. In order to keep things sealed and prevent leakage of fluid and parasites, these are SINGLE USE traps. At MSRP $10, these are very expensive traps. The only reason I can see someone using these over other traps is if you have a real aversion to mice. These traps keep you from seeing the dead rodents or having to touch any odd fluids that may be released. As far as keeping fleas and ticks at bay, my guess is most people with pets who worry about fleas and ticks already use preventative measures for their pets, which sort of negates one aspect of these traps.The traps worked really, really well. I have no complaints from a mechanical standpoint; I have complaints about spending $5 a trap only to toss said $5 into the trash, when the traditional style trap still works well and costs what, $5 for 5? It's really difficult to get past the price on these. They were somehow made to be reusable, I'd be all over them (if I can't eliminate the mouse problem in my garage) if they weren't so relatively expensive.The bottom line, as other reviewers have stated, is they are expensive but they work and would be perfect traps (and money pits) for those that are mouse squeamish.",1293840000,2011-01-01
5.0,"I have received more compliments on this birdfeeder in the short time that I have owned it, than I have on any other feeder, ever.  It is a very sharp looking feeder.  It really stands out.One of the things I like about it is that it holds a lot of food.  The feeder that I replaced was one of those thin long cylinders and I found myself having to refill it every day.  And whenever I was refilling it I happened to notice how much food was lying beneath the feeders.  With this feeder there also seems to be a lot less waste lying underneath it.The chord that it hangs from is a very durable and thick wire; I don't see it breaking very soon.  But what I like the most is the fact that it seems to deter the gluttonous grackles, starlings and various other piggy black birds.  They swoop in too hard and heavy and it sets the feeder spinning - those birds fly off!!I will be purchasing this feeder for the bird lovers in my life - it's a great feeder.Cherise Everhard, May 2013",1368316800,2013-05-12
4.0,Before I opened this product I was prepared to have several dozen parts-large and small-to assemble with this product and was pleasantly suprised. There was only about ten parts and it took a total of a whole 15 minutes!  That is a good start. The metal is very strong and nice looking-not cheap like so many of these are. The wheels did not need air which I was prepared for that too but no need for worry. It is very curb appealing-when I pull up it is the first thing I see and makes my house look better. Did not have any problem with the hose hook up either.So from start to finish it was about 25 to 30 minutes for assembly and then the water flowed. Can't wait to start using this summer!Thumbs up!,1398988800,2014-05-02
5.0,"I own two cats and recently purchased a property in a wooded area. The first time I went to the property to look at it I noticed ant traps  placed randomly inside the house with a line of ants comically walking right past the traps so when I got my Safer Diatomaceous Earth Powder, I was excited to give it a try. I placed the powder in the openings by all the base boards. Application was effortless and not at all messy. I wasn't worried about the Cats because of what I know about how Diatomaceous Powder works. In a phrase, the evidence of ants was remarkably gone within the first three days. Since then, I've surrounded the house with this and made sure to get the seams that would be hard to get. My realtor noticed the absence of ant traps and we laughed that after all my hard decorating and moving, THAT is what she noticed.

3.0,"we have a huge bird problem here. maybe it was just too many birds for this product to work? they were bathing in my pond, and pooping all over , rising the ammonia levels and skunking up the water.so I hung this around the pond, it did nothing to stop the birds. it did get the mourning doves off my deck where I hung one there. so maybe doves are easily spooked?  it does catch light and flashes around. it might send too much flashes of light in your windows and drive you away....  it did not stop the robbins from nesting under the deck, they have a nest right now, next to a strip of it. oh well.

4.0,"I use this trap to kill moles in my yard. Lately there has been relatively significant traffic of moles under the soil in my yard. I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you leave it for couple of days. I usually leave it right next to the walls, on the outside of my garage. After three or four weeks, I have noticed that the poison has been consumed by the menacing rodent. This trap is safe and the bait station encloses the poisonous material inside (Bromethalin), and it is resistant to weather. It is preloaded and you don't have to handle the dangerous substance by hand. It is also kids and pet-proof. It contains a tier of bait-station which is about four ounce of bar bait. This is pretty large and long-lasting than one ounce station. This disposable bait station has a top which is clear translucent plastic. When the poison is consumed, you can see through the clear plastic, and usually the rodent dies in its dwelling. This can be safely disposed in the trash. Another plus is that this can be used either indoor or outdoor. This is a good alternative to glue-traps that immobilize the rodent and kills slowly and painfully. The good old-fashioned spring traps kill the pest instantly but are also dangerous to kids and the pets. I have rated this product four stars for overall satisfaction.",1404259200,2014-07-02

1.0,"I've used many traps for mice and rats over the years, and the Victor kill and seal is another one that just doesn't work.  I know all about proper baiting and placement of traps, and I definitely have mice in my attic, but they won't go near the Kill and Seal.  The only difference between this trap and a regular spring-loaded trap is that this one has a cover over it so you don't have to see the dead mouse or look at it.  That is the only advantage, yet you're paying several dollars per trap more.  I guess another advantage is that the mice can't steal the bait from the trap, but that doesn't really matter if they never go for it.Unfortunately, the best mouse trap available is a glue trap.  However I think they are incredibly inhumane and an awful way to kill mice and rats.  If you absolutely have to get rid of mice and no other way is working, that is your best bet.  If you are looking for something similar to this trap and don't mind seeing a dead mouse, try theSnap-E Mouse Trap.  If you are looking to get rid of rats and have some money to burn, the best thing I've found is theAgri Zap RZU001 Rat Zapper Ultra(this product will not work with rats so make sure you know that your problem is mice).The Victor Kill & Seal is a good idea but poor execution and way too expensive for a single use product.",1290038400,2010-11-18

5.0,"I've never seen a kitchen appliance quite like this - the Emson Electric functions as a pressure cooker, a hot or cold smoker, a vegetable steamer, and a rice cooker.  It comes with all of the parts you will need for each of these cooking methods - cooking racks, wood chip holder, rice measure cup, rice paddle and scoop, both melamine.The outer pot has an electronic front panel with a series of cooking controls - timer, steam and heat, delay.  The inner cooking pot has two small contacts that must touch their mates on the outer pot; works perfectly if you just match up the bright red dots on the edge of the pans. I practiced putting the lid on, then marked the open and lock position with small labels (see my photos above). Once the machine was ready, I followed one of the recipes in the booklet for Pork Tenderloin BBQ to the letter to give it a try.I rubbed the 1# loins with a Penzey's grilling rub, folded the small end under and held it in place with a tooth pic.  Following the steps in the included recipe, I poured 1/2 c. water into the inner pan, filled the charring pot with wood chips,and fitted the small lid in place.  I arrange one loin over the lowest rack, and the next roast two levels higher.  Fingers crossed, I locked the lid in place, and pressed start on the digital timer.Within a few minutes we heard the gentle hiss of steam escaping, and then smelled SMOKE! I opened the windows to keep the air fresh, and made a pilaf while the meat cooked.  In 40 minutes it was complete.  The meat was dry-smoked, perfectly tender, with both spices and smoke throughout the slices of the meat.  Tenderloin is really too lean for a recipe like this; the pressure-smoking should render fats from tougher cuts of meat, and coax out their sweet tender sides.The smoke flavor was maybe a bit too pronounced, using a full cup of wood chips.  For two pounds you could easily use half as much. The instructions do not mention pre-soaking the wood, though I think it might temper the smoke flavor.  When I was cleaning up, I found that the wood chips were actually cinders, more burned than I usually see on my Weber charcoal grill.Pros:Excellent pressure cooker for counter-top use (no beans or legumes, though)Low-fat pressure cooker for meat/poultry/seafoodHot steamer for meat/poultry/seafoodCold steamer for cheeses, cooked meats, cooked seafoods.Rice cookerCons:Wire rack is wobblySmoke flavor can be over-poweringAll major parts require hand washingIf Emson 5-qt Electric can continue to earn its space on the counter, it will be terrific for preparing chicken breasts for salads or sandwiches in the winter, preparing specialty meats for Asian recipes, and trying our own smoked cheeses.******Update:  See additional photos above*******There are four paired buttons on the machine and an LED display to show minutes/hours of cooking time or delay until start.Hot Smoke/Cold SmokePressure - Steam/DelayBrown/WarmStart/StopSo you could choose to BROWN your meat, then add ingredients for a soup and turn on a DELAY, and later cook under PRESSURE for 45 minutes (no smoke).Or, as I did, follow the Pork Tenderloin recipe in the booklet (and pork tenderloin isn't really a pressure cooker meat), HOT SMOKE, PRESSURE, 40 minutes, START (no delay).  The drippings were too smoky, to my taste, to use to make a sauce. I'd use a traditional barbeque sauce without hesitation.Full directions are included in the booklet, and it is helpful to run through them before you are in a dinner-prep time-crunch!  This isn't like any other kitchen appliance I've ever used, and it takes a bit of time to learn to use.*****Update #2*****Let me say that this is PURE GENIUS as a pressure cooker! I started out using a primitive Presto that I bought at the hardware store in 1980.  Version #2, stainless steel Kuhn-Rikon, big improvement.The Emson is genius as a pressure cooker.  It cooks split peas, lentils, anything else that would normally burn on a stove without a problem. Today I cooked 4-1/2 quarts of a favorite curried lentil soup that I've made for many years on top of the stove in a Le Creuset pot, stirring every 15 minutes to avoid sticking.  It took 30 minutes in the Emson on PRESSURE, letting pressure drop naturally. Oh, I sauteed onions, garlic and ginger on BROWN for 5 minutes.Genius, I tell you, pure genius.  This one gets shelf space, and the Kuhn-Rikon is going into storage.",1319587200,2011-10-26
5.0,"This is a great and useful pack shovel and I've been really happy with it.  It packs down extremely small and comes with a nice, heavy bag with drawstring and cord lock.  You could easily stow this thing under the seat of your car or truck.  The folded dimension is approx. 4.75"" wide X 8"" long.  Unfolded, it becomes 15.75"" long, so it really is a small tool and the handle gives you limited leverage.  It is heavy for its size and is well made.  Though the handle is plastic, it seems durable enough.  The blade is stout and is not likely to deform from use.  (anything is possible, of course!)The blade is not sharpened, but I prefer this anyway; the edge of the blade can easily take an edge from a large metal file, grinder, or grinding wheel, if that's your preference, but I find it just dulls too quickly anyway and makes it unnecessarily dangerous.  The dimensions of the blade itself are about 4.75"" X 6"".  It is tapered to a nice point, is slightly cupped, and has a folded-over edge at the top in case you wanted to give it some oomph with the heel of a boot.  It has a hammer function for use on tent stakes and such and is actually capable of performing that task without distorting or otherwise breaking the tool, unlike some other camp shovels I've used in the past.  This one is heavy and well-made.That said, this is an excellent and useful tool for car camping, camping with larger groups (where you have more backs to carry heavy little goodies like this), and for winter or desert duty with your vehicle where you may find a small shovel useful.  (It's small enough to leave under the seat and forget it until you really need it, versus forgetting to take a larger shovel that you wouldn't otherwise carry all the time)  When I'm backpacking, however, this baby is way too heavy.  Instead, I take along a much smaller, lighter plastic trowel for sanitary duties.",1270080000,2010-04-01
4.0,"I will have to create this review with one caveat.We just got the box today and assembled it today--it is untested but seems great.  It's main purpose for us is to hold pool chemicals over the Winter instead of housing them in our larger pool shed.  It fit MORE than enough buckets of various leftover chlorine tabs and algae stuff. Fantastic room!Here is why I gave it two .  There were no problems with assembly except for the fact that there were two straps in the box designed to keep the cover from exceeding 90 degrees when opened.  Ok, I see the absolute use for that.  The problem in assembling this part if the box (and I heard no one else mention these straps so perhaps they are new) is that screwing the into the hole assigned on the lid is practically impossible because of the placement of ridges on the inside of the lid.  We could not find a tool to do this ... so we opted for another set of holes directly on top (obviously meant for a divider if some sort).  I think that the placement of those screws holes on the top should be rethought.Looks like it's going to do it's job.",1252108800,2009-09-05

They are placed high where the birds can see them but I cannot get up there to change their position, so maybe that is my fault. The others have heads that move in the wind but they do not move now so this is an effort to get a head moving. These all need ballast so you need some gravel or sand to fill in the bottom; they need weight as these are hollow and light and the wind will blow them away. I think it is a nice, natural, way to attempt to discourage bad birds; better than a BB or pellet gun. Expect them to last a season or two (one spring or one fall, or one year), as they oxidize and quit moving. The wind, cold, snow, and rain can affect them, too.",1367107200,2013-04-28

4.0,"We love our summer cardinals, finches, and hummingbirds.  We love our cats, too, and lowlying birdbaths and birdfeeders are just too tempting for our furry friends.  I was thrilled to see this hanging bird waterer.  It's the perfect solution to the backyard dilemma.  I've hung it in a tree so it's handy for perching birds, but out of reach of marauding felines who are too fat to climb.  Truthfully, the backyard balance of power is pretty equal, and we've had very few casualties.The waterer itself is large.  It'll hold 64 ounces and the top is semi open so it can accept rainwater.  It's a little tricky to assemble, but operates on the same principle as the dog and cat waterer that invert a reservoir over a bowl and the water level is controlled by physics and a spring.  The unit is pretty heavy when full, and the hanging loop isn't all that sturdy, so I hope it can stand up to the outdoors and the water's weight.This is a wonderful offering to our backyard birds, who seem to like us in spite of the Meowing Menaces.

3.0,"This fire pit comes with all you see in the picture, plus a tool so you can lift the lid once the fire is lit a vinyl cover to protect it.  So assembly is easy, if you do it the right way the first time, lol.  My husband is great at assembly required projects and has even built many wonderful things from scratch.  My husband looked at the pieces and said ""this doesn't make sense"" they way they have the bolt, screw, and washer connect to the bowl so he put it together the way he thought it should be, and it was wobbly.  Then, he figured out the legs have to be on a certain side for the base to fit so that it has a stable base.  So, he took it apart and put it back together, and it holds together fine.  Unlike other reviewers, it hasn't moved on its own or made noise, despite recent bad weather so ours seems stable.  I agree with one reviewer being puzzled by the suggestion of sand at the bottom of the bowl, when it has holes in the bowl.  We put tiny stones.  Perhaps they don't want you to put a fire directly in the fire pit, but that seems to me to defeat the purpose for some people to have to buy extra things for it to be safe. We already had the tiny stones. When I read about not putting it on the deck and then what they said about sand, it made me wonder if they said those things so people can't sue them, lol.  We got it for free because I review for Amazon vine, so can't speak whether it is worth the cost, but those that paid for it seem to think not.  It looks great, but of course you want to be able to use a fire pit safely.  I will send updates if anything happens to the product after we have used it more times.So to recap for us it is stable, looks great, and is usable.",1367625600,2013-05-04
3.0,"Let me start by saying some positives about these planters. First, I was surprised at how big they were. Guess I couldn't tell from the pictures their size. The larger one could easily plant a small tree in (i.e. if you were in the south, you could plant a small orange tree). Second, they were heavier and sturdier than I anticipated (no fear in leaving it on the patio and having it blow over). What I didn't care for it was the color first (a super drab grey), the feel of the pot (some kind of a metallic) and most importantly the fact that there is no drainage in the bottom (not good for root rot). I planted a rose bush in the large one to put out on my outside patio. Given that I don't have any kind of drill to make a hole in it, I am just hoping that the watering I am doing will not collect on the inside of the planter to harm the plant (I have several inches of potting soil beneath the roots and the bottom of the planter). I am sure, if I were handier or if I was more of a horticulturist I could have figured out how to solve this dilemma.Follow up 06-04-2011: Well, the inevitable happened. Without drainage holes in this, my rose bush died last year. There was so much collected water in the bottom (from rain) that although you couldn't see it from the top, the roots goet all rotted. The planter sat in my garage over the winter. Last weekend, a friend drilled five holes in the bottom of the planter for me and I replanted (this time with a large tomato plant). I will let everyone know how it goes. If I had the opportunity, I would have changed the rating of this to 1 or 2 stars for the aggravation and death of my rose bush. Never saw a planter that was set up like this before, really bad design. These are not cheap either, but honestly they are not worth the money at all.",1242777600,2009-05-20
5.0,"I have a 2001 Weber Genesis Silver B, and last year it started being reluctant to heat quickly and all the way to 600.  Last week the grill never got hotter than about 400, so I knew something was wrong.  I took the grill apart and looked at the flame, and it was fairly yellow.  Also, the bar that connects the three main burners wasn't working to transfer the flame from one bar to another.I bought this set from Amazon and installed it today.  You have to take the grill apart, including taking the control panel off, the manifold off, disconnect the gas, take the flavor bars and grates out, etc.  After I had everything uninstalled I elected to drag mine out in the yard and pressure wash it.  After it dried I installed the new burners, new flavor bars, new grates, etc.  I went all stainless this time.  The flame coming out of the new burners is blue, and is very hot.  I also put a new starter in, and the grill starts so nice and easy and the bar that connects the three burners transfered the flame from one burner to another.  It reminded me of when I first bought it.  The grill heated up to 500 in about 5 minutes...a night and day difference from before.You might think I'm crazy for investing $160 in grill parts, after all some grills only cost $160 for the entire grill.  I know that my Silver B is good for another 5 years at least, and I LOVE this grill.  Who knows when they'll stop making parts for these grills?Anyway, my advice to you is if you have a Weber gas grill that is more than 6 years old and you haven't replaced the burners yet, and you are experiencing any of the symptoms I described, don't hesitate to put in new burners.  It's relatively easy, and it makes a huge difference.",1258156800,2009-11-14

5.0,"I have a dandy almost new gasoline power washer with a 2,500 PSI capacity, but I can't get the Honda engine on it started--old gasoline screwed it up I think.  I bought this AR North America AR383 electric washer hoping it would be less hassle to use and its 1,900 PSI capacity would not be all that much less powerful than the gas one.  Actually, my gas washer has Zero PSI at the moment.  Anyhow, the electric power washer did not disappoint.  It was easily powerful enough for the tasks I had for it today.  Frankly, I thought it was very similar to the power my gas machine produced the last time I had it running.The extensive research I did on these electric power washers took me to the AR383 as I passed over the yellow one, the green one and the Costco `snappy' one.  I even rejected electric washers that claimed to be slightly more powerful and a couple that were cheaper.  The AR383 was priced right for what it offers and had the features I thought were the most important.I got the deck cleaned off.  It was not all that dirty, but had a little algae and mold on it from the winter weather.  The electric washer did a good job with that.  I also got the metal garden shed cleaned of lots of algae and dirt and the machine performed well with that as well.  The work on the shed went a little bit slower than it did with the gas washer last year, but quickly none the less.I tried out the detergent applicator to speed things up and was not all that impressed with it.  It works OK, but a squirt bottle or a pump up garden sprayer full of deck wash would probably do as well.  As it turned out, I really didn't need to apply the detergent anyhow.  The power washer did the job nicely without any Chemical help.The thing I like best about the new electric power washer is how the motor and pump shut down when the trigger on the wand is released.  It is also relatively quiet and does not leak.  The electric wire is pretty long, but I had to use a short heavy duty extension cord to get the washer close enough to the garden shed way out in the backyard, but that was no problem really. The high pressure hose is a squirmy snake like all of these things are and it tangles once in awhile, but I suppose that is a nuisance to be endured with power washers.  The overall quality built into this machine is quite good.Do I like my AR North America AR383 electric washer?  You bet I do.",1305158400,2011-05-12
5.0,"This is a good size trap for those mixtures of animals from cats to racoons.  You can release the ones you didn't mean to catch and get rid of the ones you did.  I like to use a trap of this size to catch pests when I'm unsure of what it is.  Sometimes you think it is one animal and then you find a different visitor.First the trap is sturdy.  It handles well and sets easily.  Once you catch something, it stays there until you're ready.I deal with a lot of groundhogs, raccoons, opossums, etc. even with houses all around.  There is a lot of woods they come out of looking for something to eat.  This allows me the choice of releasing someone's pet versus a wild creature that is going to keep coming back.If you're looking for a solid trap...this is a good one to have.",1368576000,2013-05-15
3.0,"As others have stated, it is a very good blower with plenty of power.The 40v 4AH battery lasts almost 45 minutes, depending on the power setting -- which depends on the type of leaves and condition.Two switches control on/off and hi/low, plus a variable dial for speed. Seems to me, they could have incorporated hi/low function into the speed control because having a separate hi/low switch is an extra step.At maximum power (needed for vacuuming) it only lasts 15 minutes, so I use extra battery packs from other G-Max tools I own.The suction is insufficient for some smaller/heavier leaves -- they get sucked in, but tend not to get discharged unless broader leaves are also used, even at maximum power. Also, needle-like leaves tend to get stuck underneath the sensor wire at discharge nozzle.For this reason, I would suggest getting the blower-only model if you do not need the vacuum function.FYI - I also use Toro 51609 blower/vac which is excellent! It is AC-corded, so it is pain to drag out extension cords, but it is more powerful and the work can be done in about third of the time compared to this GreenWorks DigiPro. I use the DigiPro cordless when it is too far from the outlet, though.The charger is disappointing. It wastes power even when not charging and they say to unplug it when not in use. It is a pain when several chargers are used. Two LEDs indicate power and charging status. There is a label wrapped around the plug that explain how to interpret the LED color and blinking status. This could have been better handled if they printed the marking next to the actual LED or just added a couple of LEDs.",1382227200,2013-10-20

5.0,This is the perfect gift for the hummer lover or bird lover.  I have had butterflies stop by once in awhile and once I had a oriole drink from it.  I also have the cobolt blue one and the green one and love them all.  They are a very sturdy product but make sure to screw on the bottom properly or it will leak.  Everything needs to be lined up just right.I make my hummer juice from 1/4 cup sugar to 1 cup of water and bring to a boil in a pan.  Remove if from the heat once it starts boiling and let it cool before you put it in the bottle otherwise you might crack the glass.  Having a few of these keeps my babies from fighting so we are all happy campers as they get to feed and I get to watch.  One of the best things I could have gotten out of all the versions out there.,1369094400,2013-05-21
5.0,"I'm a big fan of the 18volt B&D; line - have their regular hedge trimmer, the extended trimmer, the pole saw, the chainsaw, blower, and several others. I've always wanted one of the Alligator cutters since it came out, but the fact that it was corded held me back. Most of the time, the time and hassle of dealing with an electrical cord makes doing it by hand easier.So pleased to see that B&D; came out with a cordless version of the Alligator! Works great, and solves one of the biggest problems of cutting limbs - chopping them into smaller lengths for disposal. The cordless chainsaw does a great job of getting the limb to the ground, but you have to prop up the limb before cutting it into pieces so you don't hit the ground with the chain. This is where the Alligator shines -- the protective cover keeps you from hitting the ground, so you don't have to spent the time propping up limbs. Just grab and cut.It's also very helpful on limbs. While it can't cut through as thick of a limb as the cordless chainsaw, for smaller jobs it's all you need. Also fantastic for cutting thick, overgrown bushes -- it handles the thick stalks that stops even the biggest hedge trimmer.The downside with this, and all other B&D; cordless products, is battery life. Get a spare battery (or two) and the one hour charger. When the battery dies, swap it out and keep going. If you need batteries, keep an eye out for sales on the cordless blower. It comes with two batteries and, when it's on sale, is cheaper than buying just the battery.Oiling is a bit of a pain -- wish they provided a system like they have on the cordless chainsaw. It's workable, but you nearly always dribble out some oil, so make sure you're standing where a couple of oil drops won't cause a problem when they hit the floor.Fantastic product that is easy, safe and (at least for me) fun to use.",1226966400,2008-11-18

5.0,"Effortlessly cuts - a truly superior tool. I own, or have owned a number of branch loppers because my yard is filled with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Elm tree runners. The runners grow so fast that it seems like within a few weeks the trunks are an inch in diameter. Let a couple of months pass by and a lopper like this is a necessity.The first lopper I bought over ten years ago was a Fiskars brand. It is smaller model, and I needed something larger because of the seemingly endless job of cutting off large runners, and the desire to clip them off as close to the ground as possible - something difficult to accomplish with a saw. I purchased that bigger lopper in a big box do-it-yourself store. I was unfamiliar with the brand. That should have been a red flag because the tool was so difficult to operate, required great strength to close the blades, cutting was quickly exhausting. Being that tough to use rendered it essentially worthless, so I donated it to charity.After that disappointing purchase I returned to the brand that had worked so well for me in the past, so three years ago bought a twenty-six inch ultra-blade Fiskars lopper with the same power head design as the model used for this review. I always associated quality with this brand, and although I was happy with the surprisingly inexpensive price tag, after briefly working with the twenty-six inch lopper, it was clear that along with the dropping price, the quality had also noticeably declined. While a great improvement over the lopper that didn't work at all, it wasn't nearly as smooth to operate and didn't seem to stay sharp as long as my older Fiskars.So, I viewed this latest lopper with some suspicion but when it arrived it was obvious that it was of better quality than my last Fiskars model. I compared them side-by-side and although the mechanism is similar, the quality of the materials and workmanship is different. On this model the steel is more refined, less coarse, the edges on the head are finely finished, the bolts are of higher quality, the handle much more comfortable to grip, and it operates smoothly and so far the blades haven't dulled as quickly.My last Fiskars lopper, model which cost just under $30, was made in China, and this much more expensive version is made in Finland. It appears the old quality has returned. And although there is a market for both products, the reality is that finding inexpensive, lower quality items of all sorts isn't difficult, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find quality made items. This is welcome news because it is always good to have options. And, if interested, read a discussion about quality differences in production locations in the Fiskars scissors reviews on this site after all production for that product line was moved out of Finland.I've been working with the lopper for the last few weeks, and since I ignored the Elm tree runners for far too long, there was much to cut. It was a big job, but this new model cut through everything smoothly and effortlessly. As far as quality, it puts my last Fiskars lopper to shame. I don't like wasting money, and if this was a tool I just used occasionally perhaps the quality difference wouldn't be so noticeable, and the price difference hard to justify. But with tools that get a work-out, I find it is best not to scrimp.",1379462400,2013-09-18

4.0,"Feeder is sturdy as well as attractive- I was impressed with how solid it felt out of the box. Easy to fill and set up- each tube has an adjustable setting for either food or water so you do not have to worry about which is which. The tubes balance themselves well on the copper hanger- though I do worry a little about wind if it is hung anywhere overly exposed as the tubes are able to move along the hanger a bit. The water tube allows enough water in the bottom bowl that smaller birds can enjoy a splash or two.The only downside I can see is a lack on the user side, not design. Make sure you are regularly and thoroughly cleaning out the water side between fillings. Otherwise it is the perfect environment for interesting and unsavory things to grow.

It heats up quickly and evenly right through my car's cigarette adapter. The coating on the grill is not non-stick, but handled hot dogs, vegetables, and fish very well with minimal sticking, and was easy to clean. This is a big plus when I'm out in the woods with little access to cleaning supplies. Actual cooking was handled very well, and surprisingly, I was even able to get a nice sear from it, which I wasn't expecting from an electric model.

3.0,This is about the most solidly built light expanding hose that I've seen - so maybe it will actually be quite durable.  The brass fittings are solidly made - not those ultra-thin fittings that break the first time.  It helps that it comes in my wife's favorite color purple.  We have a large yard and our sprinklers do not cover everything perfectly.  To reach the farthest corners of our yard we need 150 feet of hose.  To cover that with this hose we'd need  6 hoses (3 for the front and 3 for the back).  That's rather expensive.  But 150 feet of regular hose is soooo heavy.  What we do is use 100 feet of regular hose and then put one of these expanding hoses on the end and that works as most of the weight you are lugging around is the final 50 feet.  because of the solid brass fittings we readily change sprayers as needed.,1397779200,2014-04-18

It takes about six batteries worth to do all that we have to do. I've solved this by buying their tiller (see review) and a second trimmer. I now have 5 batteries and three chargers.

It appears ""stuck"" and I'm not a weakling.  I have not been able to get any response from the B&D; Customer Support people and I've been trying for 3 weeks now to get some help on how I can ""free"" the battery from the mower.  As it is, I can't recharge the battery, so I can't use the mower.  I have a $400 mower that worked work because the battery is stuck in a position that won't allow the battery to recharge.  If I can't get any help from B&D;, which looks less than promising at this time, I'm dropping my rating to 2 stars.",1305849600,2011-05-20
3.0,Power wise it will never compare to a gas blower but I like the quick fast startup and instant power with battery powered tools.  I just dreaded starting up the gas blower.  Plus I like that I'm reducing my carbon foot print.,1387756800,2013-12-23

3.0,"For the most part, I really like this fire pit, but there were a few drawbacks.Pros:1. Assembly was really non-existent.  The copper bowl just sits in the legs and, viola, it's assembled!  I have another fire pit that required legs to be screwed on, handles to be put on, was missing screws, etc., so this is a big bonus.2. The hammered bowl is beautiful.  I didn't have any issues with dents in mine at all.3. The entire fire pit is bigger than I thought it would be.  For some reason, I expected something smaller in diameter and was thrilled when it arrived and was bigger.4. LOVE the cover.  It has thick elastic and it big enough to tightly cover the entire copper bowl.  If take care of, this will eliminate the water getting into the bowl which is a big problem I've had with other fire pits.5. It is heavy, in my opinion, which makes moving it around hard, but will also keep it in place when the wind blows.  I'd rather have it stay in place!Cons:1. I agree with those who said the screen didn't fit perfectly.  It's almost like either it or the bowl aren't completely round.  I can make the screen pop into place, but for the price, this should be an exact fit.  I read the other reviews complaining that the screen rusted.  I haven't had the pit long enough to see if that is an issue for me or not, but I'll update if it is.2. I wish I had come with a poker.  Again, for the price, the user shouldn't have to buy an extra accessory to tend to the fire.Overall, it is a very beautiful fire pit and would be a great addition to any patio.EDITED 6/9/2013I changed this from four stars down to three.  The weather finally got good and I was able to actually use this pit for a fire.  While it worked perfectly, it is no longer a pretty fire pit.  At first, I thought all the discoloration was because it needed to be cleaned out, but after a thorough scrubbing, it looks awful on the inside and outside.  I added a photo for you to see, but it's in the main photo lineup.",1366848000,2013-04-25

Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy, and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be, which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now, and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue, it's great!

2.0,"What good is a feeder if birds don't use it?  This is the second Perky-Pet feeder we've gotten that just doesn't seem to attract anything, even though birds (and squirrels) are aplenty.  The feeder's weight-activated slammer is an appealing feature, but the flimsy tension knob which controls weight settings has a mind of its own.  The knob turns but produces insignificant (almost non-existent) tension changes.We have feeders of all types set up on several acres of land, and birds frequent every single one.  Not so with the Squirrel Slammer--even pesky squirrels haven't gone near it.  Wondering if the little dome was a deterrent, I took the advice of another Amazon reviewer and broke it off with a rock.  The plastic dome easily snapped in half.  Now a few clinging birds (chickadees, nuthatches) occasionally use the Squirrel Slammer, but it is readily apparent this is not any birds' favorite feeder.  I think the ill-designed perches and distance from seed has a lot to do with it.Perhaps colder weather will change usage, and we'll actually get to see if the product lives up to its name of slamming out squirrels.  Regardless, I look for bird products that offer immediate appeal.  For whatever reason, such little activity indicates birds just don't like this feeder.  If they aren't happy, neither am I.",1377993600,2013-09-01
5.0,"I&#8217;ve used Preen products as a fertilizer/weed preventer in my flower gardens for a long time &#8211; for initial planting and later in the spring.When planting I mix Preen with the soil before dropping in the plants so it can work at the level of the roots and then sprinkle some along the top of the soil after planting is complete. I still end up weeding but like to think that I spend less time weeding than if I had not applied Preen.The new Preen for 2014 comes with a very nice feature &#8211; a battery-powered spread to give a more even, balanced coverage with less strain on the back. All you have to do is flip the cap to the open position, tilt the container down toward the bed and move it evenly across the soil. This really makes it easier to apply makes me love my Preen even more!Preen is formulized to kill 200-plus weeds and is supposed to kill weeds for up to three months. That might be so but I still reapply once a month just to be sure. You can refill the container when it empties by purchasing a 5-, 10- or 30-pound bag and keep using the battered operated spreader. And the batteries are replaceable.Lebanon Seaboard Corporation, which produces Preen, also makes fertilizer, grass seed, turf products, and wild bird seed.

4.0,"Even when I received the box and looked at this feeder in person, I still thought the caps and bases were going to be actual brass...  but they were plastic.  It definitely does look nice though.  I've had lots of birds coming to visit it.  I am having an issue with the water side though because sometimes the wind blows hard enough to tip the feeder enough to make all the water come out.  I would have loved it if the water side had a deeper base so the water wouldn't spill out so easily.  Once I discovered this issue, I moved the feeder to an area that was less prone to the wind and I haven't had as much of an issue.  I actually had a neighbor comment on the feeder and how nice it was.This is a great looking feeder, but I don't expect it to hold up for more than 4 years or so (especially with the amount of use it is getting).",1307923200,2011-06-13
3.0,We have either a roof rat or some sort of squirrel or chipmunk in our attic.  There are small piles of spindle-shaped poop scattered all over part of the attic.We set a few different traps to see which one would work as rats are notoriously cautious about changes in their surroundings.  Right now the Tomcat Wooden Rat Trap is baited with peanut butter and birdseed. Our Victor Wood trap is baited with peanut butter and bacon grease.  Plus we have a Victor battery powered zap trap set just in case.So far we haven't caught anything and the poop is still fresh and shiny.  I will report back when we do (or fail to) catch anything.,1403827200,2014-06-27
4.0,"First of all, I love this trimmer. I have had it less than a year, so I can't comment on durability, but it is very light, and very easy to use.The handle adjusts for perfect balance. You can (and I often do) use this trimmer one-handed, then switch hands.This item is very light, very easy to use, and very quiet. No noise from a gas motor, no hassle of dragging around very long extension cords.The trimmer string advances automatically, so there's no need to mess around with the spool or tap the trimmer to advance the line.The head pivots so you can switch back and forth between edger and trimmer modes in seconds.I use this for edging, weed eating, and to cut grass on a steeply sloped portion of lawn.  It works great.When the battery is at full charge, this item has decent power. Shortly before the charge is gone, there is a sharp drop in power, which lets you know it's time to switch batteries and plug the one you're using into the battery charger. The unit comes with two batteries and one charger.My only complaint is that the batteries only hold a charge for about 15 minutes, after which it takes 9 hours to recharge them. The unit comes with two batteries and one charger. So you can do your front yard one morning, and your back yard the next, if you remember to swap out the battery being charged before you go to bed.If the unit came with four batteries and two chargers (or if the batteries held charges longer or took less time to recharge), this item would be perfect.Update after two years:  After one year, the batteries only last 5 minutes.  After a year and a half, they don't work at all.  Replacement batteries are very expensive.  The Black and Decker replacement battery I bought was better than the originals, but only holds a charge for a short period of time after a few months of use.  The third party NiMH (not NiCad) battery I bought has been the best of all, but it originally lasted 30 minutes and now is down to 15 or 20 after a few months of use.  The replacement battery charger I bought charges batteries in two to three hours instead of nine, but the two original batteries have died since I started using the new charger, and the replacement batteries are fading fast.I still like the trimmer a lot, but the batteries are so expensive, I will buy a different when these batteries die out.  I hope they last the rest of the year.",1335398400,2012-04-26

4.0,"The Zareba battery operated electric fence kit works perfectly at keeping our geese off the new sod and out of a garden area. I was really surprised at how quick and easy it was to install. There are only eight steps, and they are all only one sentence long, pictured on the side of the box. The only tools needed are a pair of wire cutters, which are only used twice, and a hammer to drive in the ground stakes.This is the way I like to set things up, no dragging the whole tool box out, and no 25 page instruction manual that I have to read three times to understand.Another nice thing about this product is it comes with a charge tester, so you can see if the wires are charged and sending out a shock without actually having to touch it.The only thing that I feel could have been better in the design of this product is the stake that holds the energizer(the control box). It is made of plastic and not designed to be driven into the ground by force like the fence stakes or ground stake. So unless you have perfect soil conditions, installing this involves softening the ground with water or digging a hole. Also the box said 4 batteries included which was not the case, and actually it only requires 2 batteries. Could have meant an extra trip if I did'nt have some.All and all an easy to use product that works just like it says.",1346544000,2012-09-02
4.0,"This unit works very well, and does so for mice as well. Slight nit-picking in that that LED only notifies for a 24 hour period of a kill. I keep this in my garage, and might not go in for 2-3 days. If there was a kill on the day after I was in, I wouldn't see the light blinking if it was a couple days later. It would've been just as easy to design this with a longer blinking ""Kill"" light. After all LED consumption is very minimal. But this doesn't affect the effectiveness, so it still gets 4 stars!Safe for kids it says on the site here. I guess it is safe in the sense that there are no poisons. The included instructions say to keep away from kids and pets. I imagine it would give a bit of a jolt if they stuck their hand/paw into the trap.",1308182400,2011-06-16
5.0,"I&#8217;ve been using food contact safe gloves for years when I use my smoker since it&#8217;s far, far easier to pick up cooked food by hand versus using tongs. The gloves I&#8217;ve been using were fabric that was coated with a heat resistant material. They worked, but the safe temp limit was about 200 degrees, which meant while I could pick up food with them, I could not use them as general heat protection mitts.These, however, are made of silicone and have a far higher temp resistance while still making it possible to use them to pick up food. They do have some quirks &#8211; the silicone is sticky, which can make it a bit tricky to get them on your hands. But, a little finger wiggling and stretching the silicone gets the job done. They are also short &#8211; they don&#8217;t go past my wrist. A longer extension would be a useful addition.Finger and hand mobility with them on is decent. They are more than limber enough to allow me to pick up not only food, but roasts and kitchen tools. Cleanup is simple &#8211; with the gloves on, drizzle some dish detergent and then wash your &#8220;hands&#8221; under water. Quick and easy!These would be perfect if they had a cloth liner to make it easier to put on, and an extension cuff (also fabric) to protect forearms from spatters. But, even as-is, I&#8217;m finding these to be very useful and handy to have not only for BBQ/smoker use, but also for general kitchen tasks. Novel product that is very helpful to have.[Sample provided for review]",1403481600,2014-06-23
5.0,"I live in an area with lots and lots of deer.  They consider our landscaping to be a private salad bar, eating the more delectable perennials right down to ground level.  I tried a lot of different deer repellents, none of which worked very well.  I spoke with a fellow who runs a nursery about half a mile from my house.  I figured he must have a solution to protect his thousands of bedding plants.  He swore by Deer Off.  I tried it, and it really did keep the deer from eating my landscaping plants.  The only problem was that it was inconvenient to mix and apply the product.  So I was eager to try this ready-to-use version that comes with its own sprayer.  I can report that it's super convenient, and the sprayer works well.  Convenience is important, since inconvenience means procrastination, and procrastination means chomped plants.On the downside:  This is a more expensive way to buy Deer Off, and the sprayer requires batteries.  I wish it were a pump sprayer, but based on experience with similar products I'm guessing the batteries will last a long time, so no big deal.  You could achieve the same result by buying the concentrate and a pump sprayer, and leaving the sprayer filled with Deer Off.  That would probably be a more efficient solution if you have a lot of plants, but this package is convenient for smaller areas.",1338076800,2012-05-27

5.0,"This hummy feeder was a surprise in that it is much nicer in person than the Amazon picture shows.  Refer to the customer images posted to get a better idea of how it looks.  Having had many feeders over the years, the two things that I really look for is that (1) it does not lose half or most of the liquid when I flip it over after filling and (2) does not leak, hence, this one gets five stars from me.  This feeder is one of the most easy to fill that I have ever used.  At 10 ounces, I wish the size were a little bigger, but you are supposed to be washing this out twice a week, and you will need to have or fashion a hanger. It is a little pricey at $15; if Amazon ever marks it down to $10, it would be a real buy.",1339459200,2012-06-12
5.0,"I'll be brief as most everything has already been said.I'm surprised at how well it's made.  While the perfectionist may find improvements, and will make modifications such as adding thermometer probe ports, it's a great cooker.I originally ordered a 22 but because of the reviews citing how huge it is, I changed my order to the 18.  While it's perfect for what I need, I wish I would have stuck with the monster 22.  I've learned that fuel usage varys greatly from person to person.  A friend goes through a lot more fuel than I do with the same 18, but our technique's are different, and he's changing to what I do now for better results.But on the plus side, the 18 is also more portable if you have a need to take it with you, or even just move it in the yard as I've had to do a time or 2.  I could not pick up the 22, assembled, especially hot, and move it.If I were to find 1 negative, the only thing I'd like to see changed is the shape of the water pan.  It's big which was an improvement over the older models, but it's big enough to make it more difficult yo manage the coal/wood when and if you need too.  It can be done, but it could be easier if the pan was not so deep.Free tip, for ribs, which can be a challenge because the space they take up when laying flat, buy a 2nd top grate (easy to find for about $15 at any Home Depot, Lowes etc.)and flip it upside down and set it on the top grate.  You'll have a double decker rib rack without using a rack to stand them in.  Cutting the racks in half makes it much easier to handle, plus configure on the grate.Bonus tip, find a good meat market!!",1313625600,2011-08-18
5.0,"This Toro Trimmer replaced a first generation Worx GT in my yard care arsenal.  I loved the design of the Worx but the NiCad battery was a gutless wonder.  I was considering upgrading to their new Lithium-ion model when I was offered this Toro to test.  The comparison is night and day.  You can charge up the Lithium battery ahead of time and a week later it will still be ready to go like you just took it off the charger.  It has really good power and cut through all but the most hard core weeds I could find.  My dry run was on what is essentially a vacant lot, untended and overgrown.  I put the trimmer on the ""power save"" setting (the blade is positioned closer to the center so the cutting swath is less and the motor uses less juice due to the shorter line length)expecting the battery to run out long before I got finished.  I was nearly done with the yard and hadn't noticed any drop off in power so I switched out of power save mode and still had power left after doing the entire lot.  The trimmer easily switches to edger configuration and rolls easily to trim along walkways.  I did not ever see the line auto feed but it is so easy to manually feed it (just push a little button and pull out some more line).  Actually this will probably prevent wasted trimmer line in the long run.  I took off the little wire guard since it seemed to keep me from getting as close to my desired targets as I wanted.The only think I miss from the Worx trimmer is that the head on the Toro is fixed.  The Worx pivots so you can get a better angle to go under shrubs.  On the Toro, you just have to compensate with the angle at which you hold the shaft so it is more something to get used to than a big design flaw.The weight, balance and height adjustment of this tool work great for both me and my husband.  I used to dread edging but now we fight over who gets to do it!",1336435200,2012-05-08

4.0,"I'm really happy with the assembled product but we had to work through some issues to get here.Packaging & Shipment- The box for this was huge so I wasn't completely surprised that it took some beating in shipment.  I was disappointed to see that there wasn't hardly anything to keep the product protected.  I wish there had been Styrofoam around the edges to prevent damage.  My box had some holes punched into it and it had evidently been banged around so much that it caused some chunks to be broken off of the unit.  One of these chunks caused a bigger problem as described in the assembly section below.Assembly- The instructions were pretty easy for the most part but it was just copied onto a normal 8x10 piece of paper with the ink being way too dark that you couldn't even see the pictures to refer to as the directions instructed you too.  Luckily there wasn't much too it and the wording was enough for me.  It was pretty easy to put together with the exception of the damaged section that was caused during shipping.  There was some pre-assembly done prior to packaging up the product and where a chunk was knocked out during shipment it caused 2 screws to pop out of places causing the front panel to not stay in place where it was supposed to.  We had to remove these screws and attempt to find a place to insert them.  We couldn't put it back in the same spot as it was now stripped out so we had to be a little creative and put some screws in where they weren't necessarily supposed to go.  One other issue we had was the cheap screws that they included and the lack of a spare screw.  The 2 screws that we had to remove came out bent and one of the screws that we were screwing into the top for the lid broke in half so there's not top to that screw.Look & Quality- I'm very happy to say that I'm pleased with the final product.  It looks very nice now.  Luckily most of the damaged section is not seen from the outside so it look really good.  There are some scratches on the back but luckily those won't be seen.  I love the size of this box.  60 X 28 X 24.  I can store a ton of stuff in it.  The quality of the ""plastic"" pieces seems pretty good.  We have the Weathered Acorn and I really like the color of it.  I'm new to the Highwood brand and was confused and thought I was getting actual wood.  That wasn't the case.  I thought it would've been nice to have a nice sturdy lid that could be used to sit on as well but that's not the case.  There will be no sitting on this box or it'll break for sure.Overall this Storage Box turned out great in the end and I would recommend it.  It looks very sharp.",1361923200,2013-02-27

3.0,"I love the look of this, and the style is definitely prettier than the typical red plastic hummingbird feeders that I already have.  But here's the thing:  the birds are ignoring it.  I know that it's not necessary for red to be present for them to drink, and I even make my own clear hummingbird water for my feeders (four parts water to one part sugar).  Yet the birds that flock to my feeders love the ones that are red plastic more than this.  On this feeder, only the flowers are red, and a dark muted red at that.So, while a nice shabby chic style, I'm not sure it's going to work well for the birds interest.  I experimented with putting it near my other feeders and also away from them, and while I have eight ""regulars"" who show up all day long, none of them were feeling like breaking out of their comfort zone.I will edit my review is something changes, but for now, it appears to be just a pretty piece of garden art.

4.0,"I have a manual pole saw that i've used for years but it doesn't reach as high as this saw and is much more difficult and time consuming to use. The fact that the pole comes in 3 parts makes it even more useful.The manual says that the saw is for cutting off limbs and not to cut down trees (saplings) with it. I have a JawSaw which can cut trees up to 4&#34;. I had some trees which I had cut off about 4 to 5 feet up because they were bigger below that. With most of the tree already cut off, I was able to cut the remaining part at the base when less than 6&#34;.Cons:1. The manual warns many times not to touch the tip of the chain bar to anything, but when cutting a limb high overhead (which is the purpose of this saw) with such a short chain bar, it is difficult to see and control where the chain bar is contacting the limb.2. Other reviewers have mentioned oiling the chain when you change the battery. The manual says: &#34;After every 10 minutes of use... check the bar and chain for correct tension and lubricate...&#34;.  Stopping work every 10 minutes is pretty disruptive and time consuming, but apparently is necessary. I tightened and lubed the chain before using it the first time (per the manual) and sure enough, after 10 minutes, the chain was too loose again.",1383350400,2013-11-02
3.0,"The ""easy set"" mechanism is finicky. When it works, it is truly ""easy set"". But I have encountered extended periods where I pull down the easy-set handle and the trap refuses to stay set. I have been unable to determine what the difference is (and I am mechanically inclined). What *tends* to work for me during such episodes is to hold the easy-set handle down and use my other hand to lift each of the doors in turn to fully-open: This is only a fraction of an inch higher, but it lets the cables go slack. When I let the doors settle back into position (with the cable taut), this usually fixes the problem, and if not, repeat of this does.Advantages in locating the trap:--------------------------------I use live traps for mice and rats. While one can be reasonably successful setting traps for squirrels and chipmunks in relatively open spaces, my experience has been to be successful with mice and rats, you need to locate the trap in sheltered locations. This poses two basic problems:1). You need to be able either to position the trap without triggering it, or set the trigger with the trap in position. The trigger on the small Havahart traps are so sensitive that they will be set off by even slow movement into position (no sudden changes in direction or speed, no bumps). This model is no exception. However, the Easy-set handle makes it easier than sibling models to reset in a location that is awkward or hard-to-reach.2). There needs to be suitable clearance around the trap for the mechanism to move to release doors. The classic Havahart design has a rod that swings out and up from the side of the trap, requiring too much space to be located behind furniture (such as a couch). On this model, you need very little clearance on the sides, but you do need clearance above the trap for the handle to swing through. This is a potential problem: Years ago, I had rats in my attic and the trap was constantly being triggered without catching anything. I borrowed a surveillance camera and what I saw was that the rats, being cautious, would climb on top of various platforms to look and smell for danger. They used that Havahart live trap as such an observation platform, and while getting on top (before venturing in) they were triggering the trap -- sometimes by bumping the mechanism and sometimes simply by jiggling the trap. Putting something like a single sheet of newspaper over the top of the trap *might* discourage this behavior (It didn't impede the trap springing shut in my experiments).Construction Quality--------------------Excellent. Heavier duty than my earlier model (with which I never had a problem).One issue: There doesn't seem to be a reasonable way to replace the cables (between the doors and the lever) if such should become necessary (each cable terminates inside a part riveted to the door).Issues with baiting the trap----------------------------If you read the instructions and/or watch the videos, there is very little about baiting the trap for mice and rats, yet this is one of the most difficult aspects of setting up this type of trap. With a one-door model, you can put the bait on a tray in the back of the trap (enticing the critter to climb over the trigger plate to get to it). Even this is not simple because the tray tends to spill if you need to maneuver the trap into a hard-to-reach location. With a two-door trap for rats and mice, the only real choice is to suspend the bait above the trigger plate -- this encourages the critter to put its full weight on the trigger plate, to jiggle it, and if this isn't enough, the additional weight of some of the bait falling on the plate can help. My practice is to use tissue paper to create a small bag holding some nuts or sunflower seeds (remember you want a material that lets the smell of the nuts/seeds reach the critters). On some models, I can push a narrow metal rod from one side of the cage to the other just under its top and suspend the bag from it (the rod passes under the string that ties off the top of the bag). I haven't been able to do this with this model because the clearance between the top plate (with the handle) and the cage's mesh is very narrow -- too narrow for any of the rods I have on hand. I have thought of adding a loop on each side to hold the rod up high enough (using wire, string, cable tie,...). However, for my first deployment, I ran string from the bag through the two holes in the top plate. For me, this is unsatisfactory: The bag doesn't hang as high as it would with a rod, and it took too much readjustment to set up. See photo under ""Product Images from Customers"" (not at the top of the page, but to the right of the beginning of the reviews).For a single-door trap, you can temporarily remove the door at the back of the trap to insert and position the bait. With a two-door trap, both doors are spring loaded -- when your hand is inside the trap, the door is pressing down on your forearm. The pressure is annoying but not painful, but it does impede the free movement of your hand inside the trap. One solution is to latch the door in its open position. The manufacturer provides no instructions on how best to do this, or any mechanism to make it easier. What I did was slide a metal rod across the cage just under the door, using the mesh to hold it in place.OK for long-tail critters-------------------------When the doors snap shut, there is a fraction of an inch at the bottom left for the animal's tail. Note: if you trigger an empty trap, momentum takes the door all the way to the bottom, but I stuck various small objects there to confirm that it would crush or hold something similar to a rat's tail (my neighborhood has Dusky-footed Woodrats and their tails are very long -- 150% of body length).Explanation of my rating/my priorities--------------------------------------I down-rated this product primarily because the ""easy set"" mechanism failed to engage too often. I saw the advantage of that mechanism as being better suited for hard-to-reach locations. With earlier models, one often couldn't maneuver the trap into such locations without triggering it, and resetting it in place was difficult/unpleasant. If the easy-set mechanism were reliable, it would have eliminated much of this problem of putting traps in such locations.A lesser part of my down-rating this model was the difficulty noted above about baiting. This review is targeted at a typical consumer, not the professional trapper, and thus *their* ease-of-use is important. Many homeowners are unlikely to have readily available the metal rods I mentioned above. Many will not have the mechanical experience to quickly recognize what should be done. Tiny improvements in the design and instructions could have alleviated this issue.Caveat on ""Live Trapping""-------------------------Note: Many people mistakenly think that live-trapping an animal and releasing it in a distant location is humane. I have been told my knowledgeable people that it typically isn't. If you are releasing an animal in a location suitable for that species, other members of that species have almost certainly claimed it as their territory and will attempt to drive off the intruder, with injury or death (immediate or deferred) for one or both. Consequently, there are often laws against relocation of wild animals (the bottom of the product's instructions advise the purchaser of this possibility, but without explanation).I use live traps to relocate mice and rats from inside my house to my yard immediately outside. The rats occasionally find a way into my attic and after I plug the hole, I use live traps to catch any that might remain in the attic. Also, I get mice in my house when my cat get irritated at being ignored for too long -- he zips out to the yard, grabs a mouse and drops it in the middle of the living room. His notion of ""quality time"" with me is not catching the mouse, but the cooperative chase. Sometimes I catch the mouse, sometimes not. However, I do know where mice like to hide and I leave a live trap there. Aside: Before you say anything negative about my cat's behavior, recognize that his need for ""quality time"" is part of what makes him so lovable.Live traps can be useful in the office as well as the home. I once worked in a building that had an infestation of rats -- they had relocated from an adjacent building that was being torn down after sitting empty for a decade. One morning as I was about to sit down at my desk, I noticed a large snap-wire rat trap where I normally put my feet. I negotiated with the Facilities Dept to let me use a live trap in my office area (and save my toes).-- Douglas B. Moran",1398988800,2014-05-02

2.0,"Tomcat Mole & Gopher Repellent is a spray application that is to be used with your garden hose. The active ingredient is castor oil. Castor oil mixes with water to penetrate the soil. You can use it immediately after seeing the presence of moles or as a preventative treatment.The application is easy to use but I'm not sure that this is the most effective way to deal with moles in the yard. It is just a repellent so it's used to repel moles not to kill them or eliminate them. I think it depends on what type of solution you are looking for. For me, if you repel them, they are just going to move to a new spot in the yard.The bottle will cover an area of 100' x 100' area. It also is necessary to apply again if heavy rainfall falls right after application. It may be necessary to purchase quite a bit of product depending on the size of the area that you are having the mole trouble.

5.0,"I've been using this mower for a few months and so far I've been loving it.  No noise and no more fumes.  Its nice to be able to cut the grass while talking on the phone or listening to music.  I can cut the grass early in the morning before it gets hot without disturbing the neighbors.  The mower adjusts from 1"" to 4"" so I can cut my fescue at 3-3.5"" which is higher that my old gas mower could cut.  This mower weighs around 35lbs or so, which makes it much heavier than other reel mowers on the market.  However the flywheel and the extra heft allows you to easily push it through thick grass.  It doesn't produce that perfect cut like a gas mower, so you will have a few stray blades that didn't get clipped, but it cuts the blades so cleanly that its almost like someone cut the grass with a pair of scissors :)  I'm amazed at how well it cuts without stressing the grass.  My old gas mower is forsale on craigslist and I don't think I'll ever own another gas mower.  My yard is roughly 1/4 acre with a fairly steep hill in the back yard and it only takes about 10 mins longer to cut using this mower than my old gas mower.  The only downside is that this mower doesn't handle overgrown grass very well.  You will have to set it to its highest setting, and make multiple passes, so be sure to cut regularly.PROS:- No Noise- No fumes- Can cut higher than most gas mowers- Only reel market on the mower that can go as high as 4""- Adjustable handle to suit your height- Much lighter than a gas mower, so easier to push on inclines- Cuts grass into confetti/ribbon strips for easy grass-cycling- Transports easily (handle quickly detaches using 2 cotter pins)CONS:- Very difficult to cut overgrown grass- Difficult to cut wet grass.- No way to collect clippings which could be an issue if you have a lot of weeds.- Would be easier to turn and handle dips if rear wheels were larger.- Doesn't cut tall/bendy weeds well.  They bend under the mower and pop back up.- Only cuts when moving forward, takes longer to cut around obstacles than it would with gas/electric mowerSpring 2011 Update:This mower has made me a victim of my own success.  The yard looks better than ever but I now have to cut 3 times every 2 weeks to keep the grass in check, and if we've had rain, my tall fescue is on steroids and I get a real workout.My grass cutting time has increased as tall leggy weeds have popped up in the back yard.  They bend and go under the blade and pop right back up.  So I have to back up several times to get the head of the weed in the mower just right to cut it.  My front yard has few weeds, so this isn't a problem.  However its a real pain in the back yard.  This will get better as the turf improves.  However if you have more weeds than lawn, a reel mower might be very frustrating.Fall 2013 Update:I finally gave it up.  I've put a lot of work into my lawn over the past few years and it is really starting to thrive.  So much so that I don't have the time to cut it every 5 days with the fiskars, and if you ever get behind with this mower, you will regret it.  Since I have tall fescue, it can easily grow to 8-9 inches in just over a week.So I purchased a battery powered mower.  I went with the green works 19"" lithium ion gmax mower and love it.  Much easier to cut tall grass and around obstacles.  Cutting the grass is significantly less work now.  Only downside, is that even though the green works is quiet, I miss the silence of the fiskars.",1295740800,2011-01-23

One day after applying...What a surprise I found... you could see that the pellets had already broken down and a richlooking yard waste was well on its way to rich compost, I turned it over, deeper this time and again placed a layer of pellets, closed the top,This watering and turning and placing the pellets has been around 12 days now and 3/4 of the container has a very black compost, really black.  What is really great there is no odor,Amazing stuff, The packaging comes in a 2 pound box, it took very little of the pellets to start and to keep activation.  Very, very pleased with this product.Now, the only thing to await is to see how well the fruits and flowers react to this rich mixture.Here in the desert a heavy loam clay is about all there is, so a rich compost that has a rich black color is a delight,Happy with this product and will be sure to keep a box available.  Recommend this for 5 stars.",1365120000,2013-04-05
5.0,"This pool brush is the only one that I've found works on our pool. Our pool is a custom curved kidney-like design with curved corners and a connecting, in-ground circular spa. The curved outer parts of this brush work great for all of those otherwise frustrating rounded nooks. The brush head is nice and long too, so it's great for brushing the bottom of the pool in long swoops.The one negative thing that I can say about this item is that it started shedding. Now, I find this understandable due to the fact that we do live in Florida, and this plastic-bristled brush was regularly used in chlorinated water, which will eventually eat away at any plastic. There were also times that we forgot to put it away in the garage, so it would sit in the sun outside. However I would like to point out that it was a good two years of this kind of neglect before it started shedding, but when it did, it did so with gusto. I do still recommend this brush though, and I am sure that this new one I just purchased will last longer as long as I remember to be nicer to it!",1371427200,2013-06-17
4.0,"Black & Decker in Europe is synonymous with high quality craftstools for the semi-professional and the do it yourselver!In USA however, it is known as a run off the mill, common Chinese company, that at best can do what it's supposed to do, but the rest of the device is made out of plastic, not withstanding daily abuse!In this case the same! The device can cut thick bushes, and when trying to cut a thick branch, it can cut through 0,75"" branch, if you cut it from 2 sides.0.66"" ,like mentioned, is about the max branch you can cut from one side.However, the blades are made of some sort of light material! When using the blades to move 3-5 pounds of light wood cutting away from you, the blade bends.Yes, it seems to be made out of lightweight, low strength aluminum, that even your 5 years old son in law can bend!So the blades are created out of very 'soft' steel, with perhaps hardened cutting edges; or the holder is made out of very soft steel, and the blades are made out of spring steel; being bendable!Another bad about this device is that the power cord keeps on falling out, the provided cord holder/cable lock on the back of the handle does not work very well.My power cord still falls out of it.This brought to mind another security and safety issue, I have never thought B&D; has never thought of:Namely: When the power disconnects, and you have the power trigger lock on, the power switch does not de-activate. In other words, plugging in the device while the switch is locked, would immediately activate the device!When it's facing down, it could cut your leg or feet!Then again, a hedge saw is a dangerous tool that should not be in an environment near children or people who should not use them!Second to last, the device is pretty loud. Not loud enough to hurt your ears, but loud enough to not have it run next to your head all the time!And lastly, I've noted that all B&D; tools that I've bought in US, you have to mount some parts by yourself. Usually with Philips screws, without a screwdriver provided. No biggie for most MEN, but it might be for someone who expects the device to be ready and working out of the box!The good is that it's pretty cheap, and lightweight. I am not very strong, and have long arms, and barely can stretch out the device (is like lifting a 15 pound dumbbell) with a single stretched arm.The blade can turn 90 degrees, but I won't be needing that.It's purely made for hedges, and small bushes, not small trees!",1322611200,2011-11-30
5.0,"Cant recommend this product highly enough!  I like to bbq and smoke ribs, but I only have a Weber kettle to use.  I got a Smokenator, to set it up for offset cooking and low and slow bbq.  Temp control is critical for bbq, and can be hard to maintain on a grill that is not a dedicated smoker.  I have found a good setup and can usually stay around 225-250 for upto six hrs.  While I have found what works for me, I would never trust it, and need to know the temp of my bbq at grate level.  This thermometer set works perfect for that!I set it up with the temp probe hooked to the cooking grate, with the cord running under the lid of my Weber.  The cord is metal and can handle the heat.  It is also small enough to go under the lid without letting extra air into the kettle,  This is very important as airflow is the main means of temp control.  This thermometer works great and tells me my exact temp at grate level inside my grill.  It works wonderfully, but that is not the best part, many thermometers can do that...This baby has a remote!!  I can set it up, synch it with the remote, leave the receiver on the back deck with the grill, and take the remote inside the house!!  It works great and seems to have a good range.  I love the fact that it can be 90 degrees out, and I can be inside the air conditioned house and look over and check the temperature of the grill out on the back deck, having never left the comfort of the air conditioning or even leaving the couch!  It allows me to keep an eye on whats going on outside in the grill, while being comfy inside.  Without this remote, I would be outside about every 10 mins checking the temp on the receiver.  This allows me to watch it and only go out to make changes to the vents as needed to keep the temps in the zone I want.Not only that, you can set alarms on it.  You want to bbq at 225 degrees?  Set the alarms!  You can set an alarm to go off if the temp drops below what you want (say 200) or goes higher than you want (say 250).  This way you dont even really have to watch it.  You can also set an alarm on the meat probe to tell you when your food reaches the temp you want.This thermometer has turned smoking on a regular Weber charcoal grill from a worry filled 6 hr journey of uncertainty into a 6 hr ride of air conditioning and comfort, with a few trips here and there to make adjustments as needed.  I can not recommend this product enough, and anyone who is serious about grilling and smoking should definitely own one of these!!(I have not used the meat probe, but it does come with one.  Allows you to check the temp of what you are cooking (such as a brisket or butt) from inside the house in the comfort of air conditioning as well!  Like I said I havent used it, but imagine it works just as well as the other temp probe does.)P.S.  I used the meat probe for the first time while smoking Boston Butt the other day.  Worked as well as the grill temp probe!  Allowed me to know where my meat was at over the course of the entire cook (14 hrs).  Waited till the meat his 200 and it pulled with ease.  I have had this thermometer for a while now and cant recommend it enough.  Has made me much better at BBQ!",1382572800,2013-10-24

1.0,"In order to be prepared for whatever nature threw at us, we set up the Mosquito Magnet quite early in the season.  Right from the beginning, we got a red warning light, signaling that the unit wasn't working.  We tried to clear it but nothing seemed to work.  Next, the Magnet signaled a low battery warning.  Since they were new and advertised to last the season, we were a bit taken aback but my husband removed and tested them.  Sure enough, they were fully charged but reinstalling them didn't help.  He substituted other new batteries to no avail and then he called customer service.  The woman to whom he spoke was quite pleasant but unable to provide any solutions.  At one point, after he explained that our device didn't exactly resemble the pictures in the literature, she suggested that perhaps we had been sent an earlier model as if that sufficed to explain its failure.After the call, he once again removed the batteries and decided to wait a few days and try the trap again.  The green light came on and we thought it was working but after going through two cycles with the attendant replacing of the propane and the lure, the Mosquito Magnet which is unobstructed and situated just a few feet from our patio area, has caught pitifully few insect pests and our yard is no more mosquito-free than it was before we set this up.",1310774400,2011-07-16

4.0,I bought this a replacement for one exactly like it.  The old one finally was put to rest after many years of use by my parents.  This compact grill is easy to use and uses up very little space.  Perfect for a small deck.  Great construction and easy set up.  The one drawback was that the new grill did not come with the two side tables that the original grill had. I took them off the old grill and installed them on the new one.,1200960000,2008-01-22
5.0,"This is an excellent value, with 2 caveats:- Actual bench is not as shiny and glossy as the Amazon photos. It has a light brown matte look to it, not the rich shiny orange look that's in the photo.- Wood slats for seating have no give, so they are quite hard on bony butts. If sitting for a prolonged period, you may wish to use a padded cushion for extra comfort.That's it for the negatives. The attractiveness and simple elegance of the design is what drew me to this bench. It looks great, even if it isn't as shiny and oiled up as the Amazon photos make it out to be. It is real, solid wood (scientific name: Dryobalanops, sold under the tradename ""Kapur""; product origin: Vietnam), not veneer, laminate or MDF, so the $[...] price tag is reasonable.Assembly is somewhat painless, once you figure out the diagrams. There are no text instructions, and some of the drawings can be a bit confusing. It can be assembled by one person, although having an extra person hold the ends makes it a lot easier. If going at it alone, you just have to assemble it with the back resting on the floor. Sturdy and solid once all the bolts are tightened, it seats 3 people with room to spare.It looks nice in my TV room and I expect this bench to last me a long time.",1245715200,2009-06-23
5.0,"Like many (if not most!) home gardeners, I've been using Miracle-Gro products for years.

The combination provides an immediate boost, plus a long tail.Application &#8211; The package says that a single application lasts up to three months.  Because many of the trace minerals are water soluble and not in a time-release form , I prefer to use the recommended amount for the first spring feeding, and then feed roughly 2/3 of the recommended  amount every two months thereafter.  This 4-1/2 pound package will feed roughly 135 sq. ft. if you&#8217;re using it in a vegetable garden or flower bed.  For outdoor pots use 1 tbsp. for an 8&#8221; pot; 1.5 tbsp. for 10&#8221;; 3 tbsp. for 12&#8221; and 5 tbsp. for 14&#8221; pots.

5.0,"This is one huge grill cover. So large, I when I pulled it out of the packaging to try it out on my Weber charcoal grill, I realized it could almost fit two of them under it. So I decided to try and fit both my Weber and my electric smoker under it. While the base of my smoker is bulky and square like the top, the bottom of my Weber is just slim metal legs. So even with this grill cover cinching closed at the base, both my grill and my smoker are able to fit inside it together, as it's the bottom that's shaped more narrowly than the top.It's much softer than I expected it to be. Other grill covers I've had have been a more tarp like material. This is softer, like fabric, and drapes around the contours of the grill underneath it. The cover has sewn on handles and vent flaps on either side, and even a large pocket for keeping thing like dripping utensils.I really like the light color of this cover. It matches the siding of my house, and has a cleaner look to it than the black covers I've had in the past. The brown color blocking at the base is nice since it keeps in mind that this section of the cover would be the most likely to rub/drag against the ground, porch, garage floor, etc. Since it's the most likely section to get dirty, being dark brown helps hide what dirt might get on it.I'll be very interested to see how well this cover holds up to our brutal northern Minnesota winters. Where sub zero temperatures and non-stop snowstorms last many months every year. During these snowstorms the winds are relentless. Last year an wrought iron bistro table I had on my porch was picked up and flipped, causing the glass on the top to shatter. So I will be eager to see how well this grill cover helps protects my Weber and smoker in the coming months. I plan to update this review with how well it holds up this winter.A product sample was provided for reviewing purposes.",1376179200,2013-08-11

5.0,"When I was a kid, our neighbor had a reel mower and I can still hear that gentle ""clacka clacka clacka"" of him mowing his lawn.  Sadly, my children only hear the loud growl of our neighbor who rushes home three times a week to mow his grass in his work clothes AND in the middle of the night.  His lawnmower is loud and smelly.Personally, we have an electric lawn mower which is what we were using to cut our grass for the past several years.  It's quiet, easy to start and easy to push.  But the cord is a little annoying sometimes.  A few years ago, someone gave us an old reel mower that my sons LOVE to use.  Unfortunately, it's rusty and old and doesn't really do a good job, they end up using the electric mower anyway.Enter our new Fiskars Push Reel Mower!  Maybe I am a little TOO excited about getting a push lawnmower but I don't care, I love it.  I put it together myself in about 15 minutes and my 14 and 13 year old sons were fighting over who got to use it first.And no, I'm not living in a parallel universe.  My two sons were seriously arguing over who got to mow the lawn.  That right there should be enough to convince anyone to buy one.  But, not everyone has children so I'll outline some of the technical stuff I like about it too.-The blades are sharp and don't need to be sharpened very often.  Low maintenance is a big deal.-You can adjust the height.  Generally, reel mowers are set at a fixed height.-It's VERY smooth to push-It has an adjustable handle which can be adjusted depending on your height.-The way the blades are set up, the wheels do not get in the way of cutting in tight corners or around flower beds.  Usually you'd have to use a weed whacker or something similar.-It's well made and sturdy-The way the cuttings are discharged is great, they don't fall back on your feet and are instead thrown forward.It's an all-around great mower.

3.0,"The first time I used this type of product was when introduced toMonterey Sluggo Snail & Slug Control For Organic Gardening - 2.5 lb Shaker Bottle LG6500.  Many other companies have gone ahead and created their own version...and now, for Dr. T.On the first use, the difference between Dr. T's and what I believe is the best of the slug killer (Sluggo), the products were very similar.  Sluggo is small white pellets, Dr. T is small red pellets.  Living in the Pacific Northwest where we have the rainy season from October until July, the differences became vast.  While Dr. T's says it holds up to water/rain, it's not quite in the same neighborhood as Sluggo.  This stuff ends up growing as it gets waterlogged and looks like some cheap dry catfood that was left in the rain.  And then it just sort of disintegrates and apparently isn't appetizing to slugs at that point, since they bypassed it and went straight for the veggies and strawberries.If you live in a drier climate, this may be a slightly less expensive version of Sluggo that'll work fine.  For me, I'm sticking with the original.

As someone with not particularly strong hands or wrists, I really appreciate the design of the hose coupler.  It is easy to grasp and I could turn it tightly enough not to leak without using pliers.  A big thank you to whoever came up with this design.  Another welcome feature is that the hose curls the way I want it to.  I keep it in a large pot, so I want a larger circle of hose and not the tight ring it came in.  It was so easy to place it neatly in the pot, and it willingly goes back into the new, looser curl.  The hose it replaced wanted to curl tightly, even after years of use, so it was always tangled.  I have four garden hoses, and this is by far my favorite.  Eventually I'll replace the other three with Scott's MaxFlex - it is the best garden hose I've ever owned.Added 5/6/2014: I have learned that I need to carefully unwind this hose out of the pot.  If I simply pull it out of the pot as I walk across the yard, it will kink in multiple places.  It is still the best hose (by far) for curling into the pot, it lies flat and it never tangles, so I'm not deducting stars for the kinks.",1395273600,2014-03-20

5.0,"Gosh, I hate to not be sure about this product.  However, I got it free through the Amazon Vine program, and must review it within thirty days, or else they'll send me to the guillotine or something.I just got back from a weeklong trip to the coastal mountains and coastline of Oregon.  This trip included hiking along the Salmon River Estuary.  There was heavy rain the day I arrived, and that was followed by unseasonably warm weather, including record highs along the coast.  Perfect mosquito weather, one would think.  I used this product, and am happy to report that I did not get one single bug or mosquito bite.  BUT, a little voice in the back of my head is telling me that it's too early in the year for mosquitoes to be out and about. I was there the last week of April, and two days into May. From what I can see online, mosquito season doesn't usually get rolling in Oregon until June.So, unfortunately, an element of doubt must accompany my positive review.  It's difficult to repel mosquitos that aren't hatched out yet.The best I can do is promise you that I will update this review once mosquito season really gets underway.Sorry....",1399248000,2014-05-05
3.0,"NOT THE PRODUCT FOR MEI am a weekend gardener, who doesn't know the difference between a pansy and a petunia.  I plant, I water, I fertilize, and I hope for the best.  Occasionally I even spray for bugs.  I was excited when I saw the bottle of Safer 3 in 1 Garden Spray because it is an organic product that claims to be not only an insecticide, but also a fungicide and a miticide.  However, after reading the instructions, I doubted whether this was the right product for me.  My first concern came when I read the label, which clearly stated that the product is ""gentle on most plants.""  Most plants?  That caused me to dig a little deeper.  The instructions state that 3 in 1 Garden Spray is not to be used on about twenty different plants, most of which I don't know if I have in my garden or not.  Then I read that the product is to be applied once a week.  Once a week?  My guess is that it will require at least two 32-ounce bottles to complete one application to my medium-sized garden.  At $12.50 per bottle, that's $25 per week.  Holy crapinoly.  That's when I realized that this is definitely not the product for me.",1305590400,2011-05-17

5.0,"Like many of the reviewers here, I grew up using an older version of the Havahart trap (the trap I grew up with is still handed about within my family).Ease of setting and trigger plate:This trap is brilliantly simply to set.  Fold a handle from one side to the other and DONE.  3 seconds.  I LOVE IT.  The older Havahart trap my favily owns was a pain, the plate had to be balanced just so on a pivot point.. and that would reset way to easily.  This is a vastly improved design (I expected a better design given that the trap is several decades old, though I am still surprised at how blindingly simple it is).Just one door:The older trap had 2 trap doors, which helped lure the animal in, but I've had problems with quick little critters (in this case, a not so little rat) be able to scoot out the trap of my old Havahart before the door in front of it dropped.  I think the one door is a better approach, the animal is facing away from the only door when the trap is sprung, so is much less likely to get out.Sturdiness:My older trap is made of much heavier gauge wire than this trap (the 1085)and the panel opposite the opening is held on by small wrapped pieces of metal which appear flimsy.  While being smaller gauge than old traps, nothing that is going to fit into that trap is going to break that wire.  Maybe bend the panels or break the wraps, not the wire.I tested the panel opposite the opening to see if there was any change a panicked animal could pry the wire wraps off, I was not at all gentle with it (I'm good at pushing things beyond their breaking point). I was impressed with how well the seemingly flimsy metal wraps held.Overall, I am very pleased to own this trap!",1307059200,2011-06-03

When I opened it, there were flakes of red stuff all over the thing. They washed off easily, but as others have stated, I would have preferred red glass, rather than red flakey plastic crap *on* the glass. But, it's been hanging a month, the birds have found it and use it regularly, and I haven't yet had any issues with red stuff flaking off when I wash it.Anyway, it looks nice, cleans fairly easily, and works fine.

5.0,"Break a sweat using the Fiskars 6208 Push Reel Lawn Mower!  Burn more calories!I have Kentucky blue grass that needs to be mowed at least once a week and at 6 days the Fiskars worked just as well as my 12 year oldBlack & Decker MM875 Lawn Hog 19-Inch 12 amp Electric Mulching Mower with Rear Bag.The blades spin after you have stopped walking, so you can slow down around corners.My first pass was vigorous, and the mower left many tuffs of grass sticking up and a blanket of 4"" stems of grass (I had the mower at the highest setting of 3.5"").So, I raked the lawn and then mowed it again with the push reel to get rid of the tuffs.  The second pass ""erased"" the lines of my first attempt and I can see lines just like when I mow with my Black & Decker.This might be obvious to you, but push reel mowers only cut when going forward.  I caught myself a couple of times trying to mow backwards, it doesn't work.On the property there are three tucked away small pieces of grass and the Fiskars dealt with those admirably, but those areas don't grow vigorously and did not require raking.With the raking it took me 45 minutes to mow the lawn, and 15 minutes of that was raking.  When I mow the vigorous part of the lawn twice with my black and decker, I still need to rake but less, since it mulches, and I don't need to rake in between mowings, I can mow back to back.  With the Fiskers, if you don't rake up the tall grass, the level of effort is almost that same as the first pass, if not worse.  So, I raked and the second pass was a breeze.Also, this push reel mower is so much easier to transport up and downstair when compared to a gasoline or electric mower.  There is a handle by the blades (it probably exists for the June 2012 grass catcher, I can't wait!). This handle allows  you to pick up the reel mower and balance it with the larger handle, just make sure that the blades have stopped before you pick it up.In conclusion, if you have small patches of lawn (20' X 20') that do not grow vigorously, like under trees, or shaded by a building, or a fence, than this mower is more convenient than a gas or electric one.  If you have larger areas (50' x 50') that grow fast and thick, then you are going to rake less with a mulching mower than with the Fiskars push reel.  Also, grass does like some thatch, so raking every time is not healthy for your lawn.  I will still wheel out the mulching mower, sigh, but I would rather not have to do so.UPDATE: 4/29/2012 --> I mowed again after 5 days and it worked great, I did two passes, criss cross and the lines came out beautifully and I did not need to rake in between and the second pass actually mulched what was leave on my vigorously growing lawn.  I would still like the grass catcher for the perimeter.  The push mower has the tendency to throw grass to the left, so if you keep the mulch edge to your right, then less grass will fall on your mulch, if you go around left you get a lot more cut grass in your garden/mulch area.",1335398400,2012-04-26

While getting them out of the yard in the first place takes a bit more work, castor-based products has proven effective in our experience when it comes to preventing repeat invasions.This particular repellent is similar to others on the market, but seems to be a finer grain and, as a result, dissolves more easily in water than others I've used.

4.0,"I own two of these classics, and have for some time.  Let me tell you right off that unlike a lot of squirrel baffles that can cost as much as this entire feeder, this squirrel buster really does work.  The internal spring action system immediately closes the wire cage surrounding the feeder when a squirrel, (or anything else similarly weighted), attaches itself to it.  As anyone that is at war with squirrels in the bird feeding business knows, squirrels don't give up easily when trying to get at your bird seed.  They have spent hour after hour crawling all over this thing trying to get at the seed somehow, but so far I have never seen any varmint beat it.  The top of this unit is rounded, and the wire hanger is long, thus preventing the foothold at the top that is the Achilles heal of so many baffles and so called squirrel proof feeders.  The squirrels will definitely test every inch of this model, and as such will keep your birds away until the entire community of them is satisfied that there is no way in.  But eventually they give up and drop to the ground, and your feeder is now open for business for the clientele you intend it for.Now for the minuses.  Despite the effectiveness of this unit, it still has a cheap feel to it inside.  The actual tube that holds the seed is made of a very thin and light flexible plastic that will eventually come to be the first place this thing comes to fail you.  It will dry up and crack when used in places of extreme weather variations, (like in New England where I am).  My Busters are both over 3 years old and still working well, but the plastic tube is definitely drying out and wearing.  I would put the life expectancy of this feeder at sometime under 5 years.  Either reasonable or disappointing depending on your track record with other feeders. Also, I am not at all a fan of the wire hanger is uses.  If this hanger breaks or fails in any way, it would be difficult to replace, and also its design would make improvising something hard to manage as well.  To really distract squirrels from finding a foothold to hang from the top the wire hangs very long, so expect to adjust your present hanger or pole if you like it at the present level.  (It's important to keep it high enough off the ground to keep it away from jumping squirrels, and of course cats).In conclusion, the price of this model is most reasonable when compared to the very effective, but ghastly overpriced Yankee Flipper. It's easy to operate, easy to take apart and clean, and durable enough to last for about 5 years or so.  And lastly, it does what it says it does, disappoint your community of squirrels big time.  Despite its couple of flaws, I recommend it.  Enjoy...",1305072000,2011-05-11
3.0,"Although I think this pen is great...I didn't receive the entire roll of polytape..even after calling customer service...and I think the height of the posts is misleading..hence the 3 stars.  If I wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:Easy one-page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...I needed this portable paddock for my goats because I have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  I was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so I called Customer Service...The rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  However, several days later, I called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  This particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. But he said I could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that I have.  I have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.I have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldn't be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  However, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, I measured and they are actually 47 1/8  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  The tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  Seems awfully short for horses but I don't know anything about horses either.The instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  I did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  I had to call Customer Service, and the rep said that you CANNOT unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  Since I had already unrolled it to the end, I had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then it's not easy to untie that knot.In lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  Guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but I saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.My ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  It had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  The posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not break with normal use.  I did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.There is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so I called Customer Service back to find that out. He said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is NOT low impedance.  So, I had to mow where I wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  Not very practical when out on the road.Planning the fence was harder than I imagined because I couldn't make a perfect square and I thought I had measured correctly but still fell short of where I wanted the fence to end.  I then discovered that I was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  Doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.I wanted something that was easy.  I'm a small middle-aged female and needed something that wasn't too much trouble so I could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  This is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.  It seems too short for horses but I posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses.",1310428800,2011-07-12
5.0,"If you can't have an 8-foot deer fence, this is the best way to protect your plants from deer, rabbits, squirrels, and other plant-grazers.  Stinky chemicals have to be purchased, reapplied, and ruin the fragrance of your garden. This method simply uses water and runs on 4 AA batteries all season. This is the way to go.For the past two years, we have used theContech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinklerto keep deer out of our flower beds. It did keep the deer away, but with a few drawbacks. The biggest disadvantage was that it was on all the time.  After my husband received a faceful of water while dressed in a suit and on his way to work, he became so concerned about inadvertent drenchings that he turned it off.  After all, showering your neighbors or their children who come into the yard to look at your tulips is not good for your reputation.  Also, the sensor didn't seem to work reliably.The Yard Enforcer solves the inadvertent drenching problem with a dial that gives you the option to operate it in daytime, nighttime or always.  Perfect!  The infrared motion sensor recognizes movement (people or animals) at about 30 feet, day or night.  The sprinkler is forceful and has very good range.  Unlike that of the Scarecrow, the ground spike is sturdy metal. Orbit has taken an effective concept and improved it.Tulip Munchers, beware!

5.0,"This zapper rocks.  I have owned one of these before and always had trouble with others being flimsy, getting an occasional shock from, and most of all, having to clean dead bugs out of its grill.  This Stinger is very well constructed with a thick insulated handle.  Its grill area is big enough to easily run it into a fly or anything else buzzing around that refuses to land, and, it is also flexible so you can lay it flat onto a bug in the wall and just bend it to zap them.  It works on two C batteries, (not included) and is operated with a push button that self releases when you let go of it.  A really nice touch that prevents anyone from accidentally leaving it on.  And a red power light illuminates on both sides when the power button is pushed.  Lastly, the mesh on this is very well designed.  The inner part is very tightly webbed so nothing can really slip passed it, and an outer grid is big enough that hardly ever does a bug get stuck in it.  Most of the time there is just a spark and a zapping pop and the moth, bug, etc, just falls away.  When it doesn't a quick little rap on it usually dislodges it..A to the safety of this thing, it should of course be kept away from children.  There is a hook at the end of the handle for hanging it in a closet or something high enough away. And remember that the power button has to be pushed to activate it, and self releases when you let go of it.  But even if a child was to pick this up and push the button, it will really do nothing more than scare them a little. I have touched the grid a couple of times and all you feel is a slight tingle of a shock, and a zapping sound with a spark is seen that will certainly make any little one drop it. A few tears maybe and some whining, but that will be about the extent of the episode.  Truly, I can't imagine anyone with children being afraid to have this in their house.

As you know the soot, the grease, etc. are one of the toughest grime to clean.- As long as you keep grease from dripping below, there is no flare-up.Cons:- You cannot let fire (or exceeds 500 degrees F) from touching the mat- Searing is almost impossible to achieve because you have to make sure you don't let the temperature exceed 500 degrees plus the fact that the mat practically converts the grill into an oversized frying pan.  The juices and the oil remains on the meat on the mat which makes it fried and not grilled.The skewer:It includes a pair of skewers.  The skewer might be the most durable skewer you will ever own (aside from a pure metal spits).  It is indestructible.  It is made of braided metal cable with solid metal tips.  The tip is rounded which makes it difficult to poke meat on it and makes big holes on veggies.  It is pretty long so you have to loop it or bend it around the grill surface to fit.  Also makes it hard to turn because the metal conducts heat. Lastly, I find pleasure on eating on a stick, which is something you probably find hard to do with a 27"" long skewer.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.",1402704000,2014-06-14
5.0,"We have had all sorts of birdfeeders, but I have to say, for some reason the squirrels don't have anything to do with this one. We've tried many squirrel-proof feeders, and well, most of them just aren't squirrel-proof. The squirrels can just take them apart if given enough time.I really can't tell you what it is about this one, but it does seem to work!",1380153600,2013-09-26
4.0,"Placement is absolutely crucial for this trap to work.  It needs to be along the paths that the mice take in the room.  Usually this seems to be along the walls, but not always.  I had the trap out for a month without catching any mice along where I thought the mice would walk in our garage.  Obviously I do not think like a mouse.  I then set out Victor snap traps in various areas in the garage and promptly caught two in nearly the same area, which was not where I thought the mice would be as it was near where we enter and exit the garage.  I then moved the electronic trap to that area and the electronic trap started catching mice.  This area was closer to the door of the garage.  I used peanut butter on the back wall as well as a little smeared along the stairs.  I knew peanut butter worked because we use it in all our snap traps.The good thing about this trap is that you can catch several mice in a row. However, for the cost you can also buy a lot of snap traps.  Disposing of the mice in the electronic trap is less ""icky"" though and there is less risk to small kids or pets from the electronic trap.  If you are willing to put some effort into finding where the mice travel it is useful.I wish it had the option for a AC adapter, although that would limit placement somewhat.",1314489600,2011-08-28
3.0,"I took 16 raw, unshelled peanuts, and marked each with a number.  Then I treated 8 with ""Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent"" and kept 8 as a control.  I placed all 16 on the deck where red squirrels forage when they are not eating sunflower seeds from my bird feeders.An hour later, I looked outside and they were all there.  Thirty minutes after that, I looked outside, and all were gone, both the treated and the untreated peanuts.The active ingredient for this product has a scientific literature that supports its repellency for true herbivores.  Squirrels are not true herbivores, so I wouldn't expect it to be particularly effective, but I did expect my treated peanuts to last a little longer.  Red squirrels are known to eat eggs, the active ingredient in this product!  I'm going to try it out on some plants browsed by deer, and see whether there is an effect.Of course, the effectiveness of any repellent is influenced by the available and palatability of alternative foods.  My suggestion?  Make sure you use this product on plants in a location where an animal doesn't have to choose between starvation and this repellent.Need more information on the science behind repellents?

4.0,I have a Weber gas grill with a smoke box at the side.  The first thing I used was made of tiny little splinter type things.  Too small too fast.  These pieces are larger;  most are too large to fit in the smoke box.  I hate having to wield a hatchet to break them up.  3/4&#34; to 1&#34; would be a lot better.  However once these catch the flavor is right on.,1400112000,2014-05-15
5.0,"This product is nicer than I expected it to be.Although the individual feeders are made of plastic, they seem to be well constructed.The hanger allows you to suspend from a building, a tree or just about any structure or support.It's great that you can use it as a double feeder, double waterer or fill on container with seed and one with water.It's both attractive and versatile.",1306368000,2011-05-26
5.0,"This is a big feeder so refilling is minimized.  While little birds can enjoy several models, medium sized birds need the extra perch space this feeder provides. For whatever reasons, the Indigo Buntings prefer this feeder even though they're small and the Rose-Breasted Grosbeaks don't fit on the small perches of my other feeders so this is the only one they come to.  The little birds use it as well as the others.Squirrels, of course, can't get any food from it, although they can get the ring off sometimes.  There's nothing else for them to get a grip on although they have tried, but apparently the word went out, because they don't come around anymore.  I've got the ring on there pretty tight at this point.  There are easy directions if you have to replace it or tighten it.The feeder is also guaranteed forever so if the ring gets lost for any reason, it will be replaced free.  You don't actually need the ring, as there are perches around the bottom with access to the seed openings and not using it even further deters squirrels, but my birds seem to like it.  Even though the Grosbeaks are only in my area for a short time, they are so pretty, I'm eager to provide an environment that attracts them.The large tube of this feeder makes it easier to fill than other tube feeders and it's easy to hang high as it has a rigid hanger that allows you to hold it over your head to reattach on a tall pole.  It is a durable feeder and popular with the birds because they can still feed in large numbers even when the feeder is almost empty since all the feedholes are around the bottom.  A great squirrel proof feeder.  Highly recommended.",1229558400,2008-12-18
5.0,"I am impressed with this shovel.  I just dug a couple large tree planting holes in our backyard with it and it worked great.  I like the all steel handle - don't have to worry about breaking like a wood one.  The step edges on the top of the shovel are large and really let you sink your weight onto it.  The shovel blade is large and sharp (I know since I just nicked a service cable in our backyard and severed it before I knew what had happened).  Being all steel, it is a bit on the heavy side but I'd prefer to have a bit more weight and an indestructible shovel than a cheap lightweight one that is going to break in a year or two.",1332892800,2012-03-28
5.0,"I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older Perky Pet, 4 flower models.  The old 4 flower model has a design flaw which sometimes led to dripping and also attracted ants and wasps.  The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well.  It is over-sized for our needs, so I just fill it with less food.  Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.  A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers, fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top. It works great, the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days!I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent, highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010, Just bought my 3rd...",1277683200,2010-06-28
2.0,"I really wanted this thing to work.  I wanted to see tight little green necklaces around trespassing mice.  But I'm sorry, this thing was in continuous use for over a month, and it didn't do a thing.Yeah, we still got mice.  Little vermin in the attic, under the deck, and in the garage.  They're cute, actually, and I don't really want to kill a living that's doing nothing but what a few million years of evolution has wired it to do to survive--he's just being a mouse, after all--but they're not welcome in my house and I don't want them around.  We've been using glue traps, and they've done okay, catching about one a week in the attic, but not so great for the garage, where there's a lot of dust, and other critters; I accidentally snagged two blue-tailed skinks and a snake this summer.  While I managed to free the snake, both skinks didn't make it, and I still feel bad about that.I like the packaging of this contraption, first of all easy to get into, and not a major garden tool operation to get through the plastic and get the product out and into action--thank you.It's a one-piece thing, that pulls apart into two pieces, the black tunnel (isn't that a thrash metal club in Berlin?) and the semi-clear housing.  The instructions are okay, but Step 1 says simply ""separate the clear tube and the black tunnel.""  There are no instructions on how this is done, nor is there a diagram or anything helpful stamped into the plastic pieces.  There are no mechanical parts, but it still took me a few minutes to discern the nature of the trap and its construction, and figure out how to get these two pieces separated without just yanking and likely breaking something.  Some improved text and diagramming would help with this specific action.The trap's action centers on the green ring, which closes tight around Mickey's neck and chokes him right out.  The packaging notes that the critter dies outside the trap, which makes it nicer for dealing with the trap, resetting it, etc.  There's nothing holding the mouse inside, no mechanical engagement that does him in, no blood.  I like the secondary effect of the mouse lying dead next to the trap, the classic fascist warning to all the others.The packaging says there's no mess, and that's fairly accurate, no squashed or perforated mouse with fluids spewed out.  But you've still gotta pick the sucker up and get him into the trash can.  That's gloves, tongs, or some other implement.  If you're a total miser I guess you could re-use the green ring, but that would necessitate some pretty intense interaction with the mouse carcass--really not worth it.  Yes, Amazon.com does sell the extra green rings, but I note that they were not for sale at my local independent hardware store, nor did I see them at the closest Lowe's.Even if the sucker misfires/fires prematurely, and it did not for me, there's no snap, no threat to your fingers or anything else.  All you have to do is pull the two parts apart, re-roll the green ring back into place, and put the trap back in place, a few seconds of nuisance, but no threat to your digits.  That's an improvement.But did it work?  Well, I put it into action in the garage immediately on receipt, 25 September.  I baited it with peanut butter (Jiffy, smooth), and nothing.  I changed the bait after a week to some crumbled dog chow, which the mice keep coming back for--nothing.  I changed the bait after another week to dog jerky treats--nothing.  I changed the bait after another week to breakfast cereal--nothing, again.  So, after a full month of attempted use, and with four separate types of bait, I had no dead mice to show. In this time a glue trap all of three feet away has caught one mouse.Bottom line: It's been a month since I received this product, and it's been in continuous use since, per the instructions, in a garage where mice are present. In that time this trap has killed no mice.  That's not a good mousetrap.  I rate it at two stars rather than one for the innovative design.",1351123200,2012-10-25
1.0,This bird feeder is a total piece of crap.  It's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together.

3.0,"I've tried everything I can think of for our raccoon problem - powdered mountain lion urine and various sprays, and nothing has worked for more than a day.  Unfortunately, the Havahart Critter Ridder joins the long list of things that have tried and failed to keep them from trying to get into the kitchen or tear apart the deck.The Critter Ridder is made from various peppers and capsaicin oil.  It does not smell very good, and you have to use gloves to apply it to make sure it does not get on your skin or in your eyes.  The raccoons seemed stymied by this for two days... and then they were back.  I reapplied the powder, and it still didn't seem to matter - they were rattling the cupboards at 3 am like always.  So, in my experience, failure for raccoons.I gave this product three stars because it did seem to work in the garden to keep the deer from eating the flowers.  I apply this once per week and so far so good with the deer.Other reviewers have also mentioned the cost factor, and I agree - if you have to apply this weekly or even more frequently as a deterrent, it is going to get pricey quickly.  I do not think it worked any better or worse than the lion urine or Keep-Away, which due to the quantity you need to apply was actually more cost effective.If you want to keep deer away, I think this would be a good choice.  For raccoons, I just can't recommend it.",1343433600,2012-07-28
4.0,"Well, as others have said this is a really nice cover.  It looks great, has clips to hold it in place, and does a nice job of protecting the grill.  But - just like anything else you leave outdoors all the time, it doesn't last forever.  I purchased mine in Feb 2011, and last week I went out to use the grill, and the cover ripped from dry rot as I was trying to remove it.  I just put a piece of brown duct tape on the outside and inside of the rip and kept using the cover.  It will last a while longer before I have to replace it.I'd buy it again, but just don't think of it as the last cover you'll every have to buy.",1357084800,2013-01-02
2.0,"SEE UPDATE at end for the rating change from 3 star to 2 star.I obtained this item through the Amazon Prime Program.  I have a large yard with bird feeders  and that attracts a lot of squirrels and rabbits.  I have tried chasing them off, but that is almost like swatting at a fly with a tissue.  A lot of exercise on your part, entertainment on the critters part, and nothing changes.I thought that since this product is safe to use around animals and did not appear to be a bio hazard that I would give it a try.  Here are my thoughts on the product:First, the Sprayer:1.  While the unit comes with batteries (4 AA batteries), they did not last more than a few minutes.  I had to install new batteries to get anything out of the sprayer.2.  The sprayer is supposed to put out a stream and a wide spray.  While it will put out a stream, it does not go very far.  As for a wide spray, I guess wide is in the eye of the beholder.  It is not very wide and it only travels about 3 feet from the sprayer.  I good hand pump sprayer that you can re-use for other sprays would work much better!  I have a 1.5 gallon sprayer that is pumped up by hand and it sprays this material 4 times farther and gives a nice fan spray!  I would have to rate the electric sprayer a 0 Star product as it is just not worth using and it comsumes batteries quickly.Second, the Deer Off Product:1.  The product seems to work as the rabbits and squirrels have not been back at the feeders since I used the spray.  Of course, it has only been on for two weeks and it has not rained, so I do not know how long it will last.  Still, it is working and that is saving my plants and the seed for the birds.2.  Having a premix product is fine, but it is a very expensive way to do anything, especially if you have a large area or if you need to reapply the product after a few weeks.Overall, I would rat the Deer Off product well, but the packaging and the battery powered pump I would not recommend.  If you can buy the product as a concentrate, I would recommend it.  I gave the product a 3 star rating due to the battery powered pump and the fact that it is a premix.UPDATE:Well, I guess two weeks is about the limit.  Just a couple of days after writing the review the rabbits were back.  I put the rest of the concentrate I had into a hand sprayer and then sprayed the plants again.  That worked until we had a small rain shower pass through and then the rabbits were back.So, I now have to say that for the price this is definately NOT a good solution!!",1344470400,2012-08-09
5.0,"The frame measures: 9.5' long, 4' wide at the base/legs and 3'9"" high. The entire frame is made of what looks like industrial grade steel; very strong and well made. Rated at a 400lb (200KG) weight limit. The entire package weights about 27lbs (12KG).The package includes:5 knob style bolts for securing all parts of the frame together.2 hooks for the hammock with wing nuts for fastening the hook to the frame.1 hammock1 duffle bag that holds the entire set-up, frame, hardware and hammock.2 sets of instructions (English & au francais), both stitched to each side of the duffle bagSetting up and taking apart the frame and installing the hammock takes about 7 minutes,  no tools necessary. The hammock is held in place on the frame by two steel hooks, the hammock's loops have a metal inner frame/hook for added security and durability.The hammock itself is actually much better than I expected, it isn't hot at all either, so you won't be dissapointed, but, as the instructions say, the hammock is made of cotton, and so will stretch, at which point, you must place the frame hooks at a lower position to compensate for the fabric's elasticity. Which brings up an important point to note about this frame, the hooks can be placed at different levels on the main posts, so you can use a larger size hammock, in case you don't like the one included or for future purchases.This bit is important:Something happened when I first set the frame up and started using the hammock. The bolts at the bottom of the frame would touch the floor, making the frame's legs tip over from side to side, creating a very bumpy feeling wen swinging on the hammock. The problem is the legs and the direction they must be installed in. The instructions do not say anything about this, so I had to figure it out myself. So you don't have to go through this, check the clearance between the bolt and the floor, try it both ways, install the legs in one directions, then switch. It's hard to see the difference by looking at the legs shape, the look exactly the same, but trust me, they're not.In conclusion, this frame and hammock combo is a great deal, I bought mine from Amazon at $150, an it is now down to $130 and at that price, you can't find better than this. The entire package is great, ready for camping or to simply leave out on your yard. You get all you need, a tool-free set-up, a carrying bag and quality at a great price.",1343088000,2012-07-24

3.0,"Amazon sent this to me to review for you. I am a serious gardener so here is my review. I like the idea of it, it is nice and thick and sturdy. It holds the soil from leaking out the bottom all over the floor. It is easy to use. You just get a pot the approximate size and put it in the bottom or you can cut it up and put it in a smaller pot. At the end of the season you can take it out and wash it, dry it, and store for next year which is a good thing.  It is light and I imagine repels bacteria and disease and bugs.So far so good that was the good part, now for the bad part.It is expensive, I would never buy this for that kind of money.  It is too thin, I can bunch up a few newspapers and have the same effect thus recycling. Who wants to fish it out at then end of the year and wash it. I am sure it will have roots tangled in it, too much work for me.

5.0,"This feeder has everything.Pros:1. The size is juuuuust right. It holds a good quantity of seed (I'm going to estimate about 2 -3 pounds) but not so much that it can go bad before the birds finish it or so much as to make the feeder unduly heavy.2. It has small holes in the bottom so rain can't pool in the bottom.3. The construction is extremely strong, easy to clean and easy to fill.4. The perch also catches seed in the perch/trough so there isn't so much seed spillage.5. The perch is wide enough to make access easier for the medium-sized birds such as Cardinals and Bluejays.6. The top of the feeder is wider than the similar feeders this company has offered and it's an improvement. I have this one that is similar (No/No Bronze Original Bird Feeder  BZ00324) and I find that I like the size of the top of this Cardinal Bird Feeder much better.And, of course, it won't just feed Cardinals. I was watching it tonight for about 15 minutes. I had filled with a sunflower seed, nut and dried fruit mix and it was doing a fine job with Chickadees, Cardinals, a pair of Wrens, two Titmice and some Carolina Finches.There are no ""Cons"" to this feeder.I really love this feeder and so do my birds.

5.0,"I intended to build a raised garden bed last spring and kept intending to build it all last summer.  But my lack of DIY building skills -- particularly when it comes to making square corners with pieces of wood -- made the project seem too intimidating and I kept putting it off. All winter I thought about the raised bed I wanted and was thrilled to get these.These corners allow me to build the raised bed I want without having to worry about whether I could make square corners because the 2 by (6, 8 or 10) boards fit into the channels in the corners.  There are little flanges (the manufacturer calls them levers, but they don't move) that keep the boards in place.  It can take some adjusting the wood into place with a mallet, but the corners will be square!If you have to worry about frost heave, as I do in Minnesota, there are 4 holes in the bottom of each corner so you can put screws (or corner brackets) in to really hold the wood in place.  You may also want to put screws in the upper corner joints, especially if you use 2 by 10 boards, to keep the upper edges to stay together after you fill the garden bed with soil.  The good news for people like me is that the boards are already secure so you don't need to worry about the corners going out of square while the extra screws go in!The corners are 6 inches tall so they will look prettier if you use 2x6 or maybe even 2x8 boards.  But I wanted a deeper garden bed so I used 2x10s.  It isn't as aesthetically nice as with a smaller board, but practicality won out.  I expect that these will eventually rust being left out through Minnesota winters so I bought fir rather than cedar in hopes that the corners and wood last about the same time.",1400025600,2014-05-14
4.0,"A few short years ago I was happily ensconced in the Midwest. Trips between towns would afford the occasional glimpse of deer; sometimes we would be lucky enough to catch sight of a bambi or a stag. Imagine our joy when, upon moving to the northeast, we were visited by a herd of deer the first night in our new home. The deer were daily visitors all through the long winter. How lucky for us! Of course we knew that come spring and summer our deer friends would retreat into the deeper forest and, naturally, we would be bereft.Well, spring came, and with it a pestilence of deer. Large deer, small deer, rutting bucks chasing females in heat - a cornucopia of strong footed, long limbed voraciously hungry vermin! Nothing would deter them from feasting on my flowerbeds. Deer repellant sprays would work until the first gentle rain fell in the night. Come morning my hostas were reduced to stubble. Pepper solutions were apparently considered seasoning. Coyote urine? You think they fell for that? Nothing worked.We finally installed a fence and, to the kids delight, got a dog. Both have helped considerably. (Yes, some of them do jump over the fence and would probably eat the pup if they could open their jaws wide enough.) That said, the front yard is still open for grazing. I was pretty sure these deer repellant sticks would prove themselves unattractive yard ornamentation. The only action I foresaw was some high hilarity when I managed to back into them weeding. I have to admit these ugly sticks admirably impress me. We have a Japanese maple tree out front that has long been considered delectable deer cuisine by the marauding herds. We placed one pole to the front of it and then positioned the other two poles along the path leading to the front area. (Yes, our house is situated smack dab in the middle of what appears to be a long-standing deer path.) To date, the maple tree has remained unmolested. Now, full disclosure, I am still using the deer repellant spray. That said, we have had some terrific rains for days on end and I did not reapply the spray, so it would seem that the poles are helping.If the poles cease to be effective or if I am fortunate enough to actually see a deer get zapped I will update this review.",1307923200,2011-06-13
4.0,"I had been using a small electric trimmer for years.  I needed the light weight of it.  Plus, it was very cheap.  Dealing with the long and heavy extension cord while hot and tired was just too much.  I knew a gas trimmer would be way too heavy and bulky for me.Because my old trimmer was a black and decker, I was able to use the same string spools.  On one hand this was great, because I had 4 new spools.  On the other hand, I was hoping this trimmer would use thicker string.  I have chain link fence around the majority of my yard, and I would normally go through 3 spools of string each time I used the electric trimmer.  I assumed it would be the same with this Black and Decker LST420 trimmer.  Not the case.  I don't understand it.  Maybe it's because it rotates faster and is more efficient.  I don't know.  Whatever the reason, I am extremely happy about it.For my purposes, I am not a fan of the edging/wheel.  A lot of my sidewalk areas are higher than the yard level.  I found in these areas, the edger didn't work well.  On part of my driveway where they are the same level, it worked fine.  I also had trouble getting close to an area at the base of my porch, because the wheel seemed to hinder the reach of the string.I am very happy with this trimmer, and it is such a relief not to drag around that cumbersome mega-long extension cord (about 100' cord).",1403049600,2014-06-18
5.0,".I had despaired of ever finding a hose nozzle that did what it was supposed to do.  Not much to ask of a simple brass hose nozzle, right?  Buying them at a big-box store was always an adventure.  Would this one work better than the one I just threw away?Well, this one does.  It feels substantial in the hand, adjusts smoothly and easily and doesn't spray in spurious directions.  The water stream is focused and precise.  It's just a joy to use.  Simple things that work well are delight to use.In my opinion, you won't find a better one that does the job it was intended to do at this price.

4.0,"This is an easy-to-use and accurate thermometer, that works great for assessing the temperatures of meats and other items on the stove or the barbecue.I've used it mostly to check whether chicken breasts are done (165 degrees F) when I cook them on our grill. I've compared its measurements with other reliable thermometers I own and it's consistent.It's easy to turn on and easy to turn off, and easy to switch between celsius and Fahrenheit. It is very fast at getting a read. You can press the ""hold"" button to fix it at the temperature while it's inserted, so that when you bring it closer to read it, the reading won't change as it cools down.For some reason, when it arrived it was ""stuck"" and wouldn't turn off or on. Removing the battery and then putting it back in reset it, and it's worked just fine ever since then. (Product received for the purpose of testing and review.)",1405468800,2014-07-16

5.0,"I ordered this bird feeder mainly to attract cardinals. I recently moved back to Ohio after 20 years and the cardinal is the state bird, and one of my favorites. But when my wife and I hadn't seen a cardinal all summer, I decided to see if this bird feeder would do the trick.It ships flat -- and opens up when you hang it on something. It was a little tricky getting the sunflower seed (bird feed) into it as a result, but not too bad. Once it was full, I hung it on a tree branch visible from our dining room and it took about 5 days before we saw the first cardinal. So beautiful!We see all sorts of colorful birds (as well as the occasional pigeon), too. I added a couple of photos of a cardinal at our bird feeder under the product photo area. Two thumbs way up for this bird feeder.",1314662400,2011-08-30
3.0,"These traps are designed for people who are particularly concerned about hygiene and aesthetics. It's true, I'm sure, that mice carry disease, and let's face it, disposing of the mice can be  unpleasant and occasionally messy (although avoiding actual contact with a dead mouse is not usually very difficult).  These traps avoid any of that.Setting the trap is very easy--you place some peanut butter or other bait in a little plug that screws out and then screws back in, pull down the red lever to open the door and set the trap, and walk away.  When the mouse is caught, the lever pops up, and you just throw the whole unit away.If you have only one or two mice to catch and then you know you can prevent mice from ever being a problem again, these may be just the  thing.  But if you have a recurring problem, this gets expensive pretty fast, since the traps are not reusable.  So these traps are most useful for those who are willing to pay a stiff premium to avoid having to see or otherwise come in contact with the trapped mice.Also, the bait is enclosed in the trap, and unless you have some bait that has a strong odor, a mouse is not as likely to even know it's there as compared to a trap that holds the bait out in the open, so it's not going to be as effective as most other traps.  And another problem:  Sometimes the trap springs--the lever moves and the red door closes--without a mouse entering the trap.  When this happens, you can't open it back up, and the empty trap is now useless.  Like I said, very expensive.",1286409600,2010-10-07

4.0,"I am an amateur when it comes to wood working and building stuff, however I have recently started getting into a number of DIY projects at the house and wanted one of these sprayers, so I finally got one.The unit itself comes in a great case that protects the sprayer and containers. I have a dewalt tool set (recip saw, power saw, drill and flashlight) and this case is about half the size of the dewalt case.Everything looks to be of good quality and solid. I'm not concerned with build quality at all on this.The spray units are easy to assemble and containers go on and off very easily.When using this, there is a lot of over spray. It's possible the more you use it the more you'll learn it and be able to control that but be warned there is a lot of over spray from the nozzle, at least at first.Cleanup is simple, no problems at all. It all washes down easily and goes back into the case.This sprayer definitely saves time and puts on a nice even coat which I love, as I hate painting. It's fairly easy to use so I like it. I'll keep trying it out on other projects and see if my skill with it improves. I would not hesitate telling anyone to try this out, good build quality, and easy to use.",1387411200,2013-12-19

3.0,"It's a bit hard to give this product a fair review because I haven't caught a mouse with it, but that could be because we don't have any mice in the house right now. My husband weatherstripped our doors and perhaps that's preventing mice from getting inside. But I really don't know... you can have mice for weeks without seeing them, maybe longer.We've had mice before, and caught one in a traditional trap just a few weeks before getting these ""Kill & Seal"" traps. After that we set out three different traps before getting these, and none of them has caught a mouse. But I know from past experience that catching no mice does not guarantee you have no mice! Some mice just avoid traps.As far as the design of the ""Kill & Seal"" trap, I like the fact that our dogs aren't likely to get injured by the traps. I also like the ability to keep mouse blood and so on away from my fingers! I don't know whether people ever get sick from handling the old-style traps, but certainly a curious pet might. And the sight of a dead mouse in a trap is unpleasant!On the other hand, can you be sure you've caught a mouse without seeing it?I would feel better about these traps if they were biodegradable or at least made from recycled material. They contain a lot of plastic and that seems wasteful. There's a style of plastic trap that catches the mouse without injuring him and those contain a little less plastic and are supposed to be reusable; however, I don't think I caught a mouse when I tried to reuse them. Apparently mice can smell that a frightened mouse was imprisoned in the box.  By the way, those live traps seem less humane when you realize you have to release the frightened creature outside and it's bitter cold or snowy out there!Back to the product in question, it's expensive compared to the old fashioned traps. Also, the instructions for use are limited to diagrams on the box, and I had to puzzle over them for a while in order to figure out where to put the bait. I think written instructions should be included along with the pictures.",1297900800,2011-02-17

3.0,"QUICK UPDATE:  We've had a rough winter, and there were some days when my feeders were inaccessible to me.  As a result, this feeder was the only one with seed in it for awhile.  The birds should have been pretty desperate for a meal with all the snow cover and sub-zero temperatures, but they weren't desperate enough to empty this feeder.  I can't account for this, but it's a big strike against the feeder.This is a decent-looking feeder (more attractive than its picture, in my opinion), and the smaller birds like it okay, although it's not their first choice, and for some reason they like it less once the seed level has dropped to where only the lower half is filled.  It can't accommodate larger birds unless they are clingers (most aren't) because the ""fly through"" spaces don't provide roomy enough perching area.  I also don't see an advantage to encouraging small birds to sit in a spot where they soil the feeder and food while they eat.  It's not squirrel-proof by any definition, although it is squirrel-discouraging and slows them down enough that they will turn to another feeder if one is available.What will probably cost this feeder its place in the lineup here is the mess of filling it.  I made the mistake of filling it indoors the first time, yikes!  The seeds stream out nearly as fast as they stream in.  Even filling it outdoors where I don't mind some seed on the ground is too wasteful.  I'm not sure where the line is drawn between seed being easily extracted from the wire openings and seed spilling out, but this feeder errs heavily on the side of spillage.I do think it might work better with shelled peanuts and might appeal to woodpeckers with those, and I may try that at some point.  I have a Brome squirrel-proof peanut feeder now, and the birds' response to it is pretty lackluster (and filling it is a pain), so it will be interesting to see if the Fly-Through feeder is a better choice for peanuts.",1395273600,2014-03-20

3.0,"I have a horrific problem with squirrels eating all my avocados so I wanted to try this product as I am desperate. I diluted the product as specified (NOTE: you need a sprayer to use this) which wasn't difficult. The spray smells like hot pepper, so it's not offensive, at least it isn't to me. Apparently, the animals can smell other ingredients which keeps them away.It's hard for me to tell how well this product is working for a few reasons: almost all my avocados are gone so it's hard to tell if the squirrels are still coming around. I don't know how long the product lasts/works as I have only had it on less than a month. I can say I haven't seen any squirrels lately, and haven't found any avocados on the ground, so it could be a couple of good signs.Here's some things I do know:-the spray leaves a milky, white residue on the leaves, so it's not very pretty to look at-there's no way I can spray every part of the tree as it's so tall and wide-due to not being able to spray all of the tree, I think the squirrels will leave the lower fruit and just go up to the top to take those-in climates with lots of rain, I think this product would be useless (I'm in California, so at least between May and November it should be okay to use)I will update this review in a few weeks if I see any other results, or lack thereof.",1372377600,2013-06-28

5.0,"I thought this garden kit looked like so much fun, and couldn't wait to plant the 18 seed pods.  But so much happens in the spring and summer, and I kept putting off finding the best place or containers for the pods, until it was July.  Yes, I started my garden in July.  The experienced gardeners I know have all doomed my little garden, saying it's much too late.  I'm not sure why, since it often stays warm here until November.  But we shall see, and I shall update this review when I do or do not harvest anything from my little garden using Miracle Gro's little seed pods--which each contain at least two little seeds.Update Aug. 15th:  The cucumber and pepper plants are doing the best right now.  They were planted in the newest potting soil, so I wonder if that didn't help them.  Six of the seed pods produced nothing.  I didn't mark the plants, so I'm not sure what is growing in all the other pots, but it's all growing slowly but surely.Update Sept. 7th:  So far, I've gotten three really nice cucumbers from the cucumber plant, and some very nice butter lettuce and cilantro for my rabbits.  And it wasn't the pepper plant growing next to the cucumber plant; it was the snap beans . . . or are they peas?  Which ever, that is doing well, too.  The tomato plants are shooting up really high this week, with little green tomatoes on them. Also, the two spinach plants are doing very, very well.

4.0,"We don't get a lot of Hummers to our yard.  We're surrounded by trees and forest, so I sure do appreciate it when they show up.I've tried a number of Perky Pet feeders.  This is my most successful feeder thus far:Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder.  I like that I can purchase new bee-guards when the old ones get moldy, and I like that it's glass.I tried thePerky Pet Antique Bottle Glass Hummingbird Feederand it was a bust.  I hate the colored glass as you can't see if there are ants or other nasties floating in the sugar water; and the small opening makes it difficult to clean.  Worst, the Hummers don't seem to like it.So it's with great anticipation that I hung this new feeder to await warmer weather and for our regulars to return.  One thing I love about it is the wide mouth opening.  This is going to make it much easier to clean than it's 8-ounce glass cousin.  Though I must say that the greater size is not all that advantageous.  In Virginia, where I live, it gets far too hot to put out a full feeder.  The sugar-water just goes bad in a day or so.  (If you see cloudiness, it's time to pull the feeder and clean.)  What I do is make up two cups and pour only part of that into the feeder.  The rest goes into the fridge.  (note: no need to use red dye.)It's being larger though, is certainly not a negative.  As I said, it's really great to be able to have easy clean up.Another feature I'm looking forward to testing is the Ant Moat!  It's supposed to create a barrier to the sugar loving pests.  But so far no ants.  (I'm thinking of leaving crumbs to see if I can get them to the moat.  In any case, if you want a barrier, Vaseline works fine.  You just have to put a thickish barrier on the support rod the ants crawl on.)What I don't like are the white plastic flowers and the fact that it doesn't appear that the sipping access is going to be easy to clean.  I'm not willing to pass judgement though until after a season passes.This feeder is definitely worth testing.  It's sturdy and has many good features.  I do suggest though that you rig up a more substantial method of hanging it.  The little s-clip that was shipped with the feeder was too flimsy for my taste.Pam T~mom/friend of the feathered ones",1370390400,2013-06-05

5.0,"This is a great tiller for a smaller garden (say 500-700 square feet).  My garden plot is in a community garden without a good storage space.  My yard at home is pretty small and as a result I don't have any gas powered equipment and didn't want to start with the tiller (that I would have to drive to where I would use it).  This unit seem to fit the bill perfectly.  I can pop the battery out and it's light enough to store it up on some elevated storage racks in my garage when I don't need it (which is most of the year).  And no gas fumes in the garage!Performance is good.  I've used it on both wet and dry clay with no problems with either.  It doesn't till as easily as a big 4 stroke gas tiller, but it's much less hassle to maintain and much easier to store and move around.  Any tiller is a pain to handle in hard soil and this is no different.  I don't think a gas tiller in the same price range is going to do you much better, but clearly if you spend  2x more on a gas tiller you are going to get results you can get with this.I own a number of B&D; battery powered products and I have no complaints, but naturally battery life would be a concern.  Fairly new I've tilled about 700-1000 sq ft of garden, but that was reasonably dry and well worked soil  I'm pretty sure if it was mud I'd gotten half that.  I haven't had this long enough to say for sure the battery will last, but I've had a B&D; battery powered mower for about 3 years that is still going strong.I'm no expert on tillers, but I've used a number of gas tillers and the big ones clearly have more torque,  but I think this compares well to gas tillers in this price range.  Ease of use is high.  You can easily adjust the height, swap out tines or change the tilling width.  Occasionally you need to unjam something from the tines and it's easy to pull them off.  It's also nice and quiet.  Overall for small gardens this is hard to beat.",1358899200,2013-01-23

It fits in well with the four more that I just purchased for my growing collection. There was no user guide or sheet with this feeder. However, it was a simple matter to discover the button on the top of the feeder. Pushing this button allowed the top to slide along the hanging wire so that the feeder could be filled with one or two different kinds of bird feed. I filled both compartments with black sunflower seed. However, it would be very easy to fill one of the compartments with a different bird food since both compartments are filled from the top. If squirrels have access to your feeders then this is probably not the best choice. All 14 of my feeders hang from poles that have been squirrel proofed.

Once you get the top pushed down completely you will have quite a challenge to remove it for restocking the seed.There is nothing squirrel proof about this feeder. You will need to hang it from a squirrel proof pole to keep the squirrels away.

It will only go onto the blades one way, so there is also no chance of putting it on wrong.The scissors are sturdy and feel solidly built. The blades are sharp and glide right through paper. I have used them for simple fabric tasks, like cutting the legs off a pair of jeans etc and they cut very smoothly, fluidly. I have used them to cut open those annoying clear plastic packages that some items and small electronics come in and they worked great for that as well. I have trimmed flower stems with them and they make perfect slices in the stem - it won't shred or fray them. I used them for cutting wire and for slicing off the rubber coating of electrical wires when I installed a ceiling fan - again they worked great.I have not used these yet in the knife function by transforming them, but I am sure it would work perfectly well, given how sharp the blade seems now and it is definitely very handy to have this feature right in your scissors. I have used theseas a knife/blade without transforming them and just using one blade egde to slice open packaging tape and that worked perfectly well.I have not used the bottle opener, as I have had no need to, but again I am sure it works fine.The built in sharpener is is one of the best features.This is one handy pair of scissors and I definitely recommend them. The price is great and the quality is excellent.",1315785600,2011-09-12
5.0,This Toro 51496 Cordless 24-Inch 24-Volt Hedge Trimmer is just wonderful. It has a lot of power and the battery holds a long charge. Very easy to use.  I am so glad I bought it.,1361750400,2013-02-25
5.0,"I've been using various rooting hormones (both powder and gel) for years and they work incredibly well, particularly with softer stemmed plants. The process is very simple, you just take a cutting (I try to get cuttings that are healthy and at least 3-inches or so long) and then pinch off any excess leave (if there are any) and dip each cutting into the rooting hormone. Then you simply create a hole (I use a pencil) in a small tray or pot of rooting medium or starting soil and set the cutting into the hole and then compact the soil around the stem. If you cut the cuttings first and have the pots (or a big tray) ready, you can do dozens in just a few minutes.I can't really verify how well this product ultimately works yet because it's going to take a few weeks for my cuttings to take root, but it's been fun trying to root different houseplants. There is more than enough hormone powder in this size jar to do probably hundreds of cuttings, too. It generally takes from about two weeks to several weeks for a cutting to root, depending on the type of plant. In previous seasons I've created dozens of free geraniums using cuttings and rooting hormone and they have all survived. I also just tried (with this powder) to start 10 Christmas cactus cuttings, so we'll see how they do.I have also used rooting gel in the past and it works very well (perhaps a slight bit better), but it's more expensive. The powder works just fine--provided you keep the soil moist. I also mist them so that the cuttings take in some moisture from the leaves.Because cuttings need to be dampened before they are dipped and I don't want to get moisture into the jar, what I do is to dump some of the powder out of the container into a small plastic dish and do the dipping there. Once I can see that the leftover powder is dry I dump it back into the original container. By the way, price-wise, this is pretty inexpensive as rooting hormone goes.I'll update this review in a few weeks when I see what percentage of cuttings take root, but I'm sure it will be very high. Again, it really depends a great deal on the type of plant and keeping the soil damp and in good indirect light. Nothing is as much fun as getting free plants!",1392681600,2014-02-18
4.0,"After trying many repellents over the years that never worked, I gave this a try and was very pleased with the results. The repellent in this works by hiding the CO2 we breathe with the citronella smell so the mosquitos can't detect you and therefore, don't decide it's time for a feast! I used this several times at night when the mosquitos are the worst for several hours and only had one bite versus 10-15 like I'd normally get. So it's not 100% perfect at repelling but it definitely works! The fan inside the lantern is very quiet and there's an on/off push tab on the bottom to power it. It actually came with the 4 batteries it needed so that was another bonus.Now to the reasons I gave it 4 stars:1. The box indicates that the cartridge it comes with lasts 3 months but when you read the fine print, it says if you use it a lot throw it out after 2 weeks of use.2. The light in the lantern is pretty but very dim so the light part is useless especially if you are taking this camping.3. My biggest complaint is that the little container of repellent is not resealable so if you want to store it for later use, you can't.Overall, this product is highly effective and I'd definitely recommend it over other citronella candles and similar products.",1370390400,2013-06-05
5.0,"This is my twelfth season for using this tiller.  To prepare my garden I use an ancient Troy built that has been going strong for about 18 years now (I bought it used) and it looks as if this Mantis two stroke is going to last just as long.  To be honest, I am a rather lazy gardener and the job of all jobs I hate most is cultivating and weeding.  This little machine has taken away almost all of the excuses I have for not having a neat, well tended garden.  There are a couple of things you should know though before purchasing this little gem:First, this is not a machine that is suitable for breaking up new ground or ground that has not been tilled for several years.  It simply is not built for that.Secondly, you should not let your mind wonder when using this cultivator.  It can take out a garden plant in a flash if you loose control over it and indeed, if you are extremely inattentive, it certainly has the capability of taking off a toe or two.Thirdly:  I would strongly recommend you use gloves when using this for any extended period of time.  They give you protection of course, but they also allow for a better grip, ergo, more control.Forth:  Try to avoid running in through bailing twine, wire or even vines if possible.  Getting the stuff untangled is truly a odious task.Fifth:  Perform the preventive maintenance on it as recommended and then double the timing on it.  Keep the tines sharp and keep them replaced as needed. (Yes, the tines are guaranteed against breakage, but I promise you that they will bend if bounced off enough rocks...hey, I live in the Ozarks, rocks I know!)Sixth:  Watch out for larger rocks.  Not only can the bend tines, but they can cause the machine to go out of control.Seventh:  Watch and take great care with your gas/oil mix and at the end of the season follow the directions as to winter storage.Now that being said, this thing is a snap to use.  As a matter of fact it can easily be handled by a knowledgably and trained child with very little supervision.  It can go into places a larger tiller cannot possibly go.  It is light and is very easy to maneuver once you get the hang of it.  Now I admit that I am a complete and absolute klutz when it comes to fixing anything mechanical (well, truth be told, non-mechanical things too), but I have had to take this into the shop only once in the years I have owned and used it.  Everything else I was able to fix myself using only the manual provided, and over the past couple of years a few sites on my computer.  No fancy tools are needed; only the ability to read and a smudge of common sense. Hey, trust me, if I can do it, then just about anyone can.  I mean we are talking here about someone so inept that my wife use to have to put the children's Christmas toys together as I could not manage it.I am like another reviewer here.  I doubt if I would still be gardening, vegetable and flowers, if I did not have this cultivator.  If and when it finally goes belly up (which will probably be long after I go first), I plan to purchase another.  I do wish I could give this one more than five stars.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",1237593600,2009-03-21
5.0,It works great. I would recommend getting squirrel out ASAP if you plan to turn them loose. Also be sure and drive at least ten miles away. They are like homing pigeons and come back home,1387065600,2013-12-15

1.0,"I want to start out saying that anyone that wants to save a mouse is borderline retarded.  They are disease carrying vermin on the bottom of the food chain.  When caught by a fox, cat or other predator, they are slowly torn apart live or chewed live.  Setting one loose in the woods thinking you are saving it will likely do one of two things.  1. Sentence it to a much more violent and cruel death.  2. Allow it to breed so you can have hundreds (yes, hundreds) more in its place.  And many of these will find their way into homes.I tried these traps along side much much cheaper glue traps and snap traps.  The glue traps and snap traps were effective.  Not one of these caught a gosh darned thing.  When placed adjacent to traps of other types, they never touched the bait on the door entrance and never went in, but were snapped or glued instead every time.The mice choose the death traps over and over in favor of these useless pieces of plastic junk.  And now that I have them, they will likely end up at a local dump for 50000 years before they break down.Nice.",1307750400,2011-06-11

2.0,"We tested 7 different products over 9 months, and came out with a clear winner (traditional Victor trap).We didn't catch a single rat in the Victor Electronic trap - but I suspect it's because we were catching Norway rats that are pretty big, and we suspect the electronic trap is too small for them. There are many reports here of this trap working - we wonder if users would have caught their rats faster using the traditional Victor, & also we wish the other users would say what kind/size rats they are trapping.We baited all the traps the same (the Victor web site has great advice if you need more information on baiting & identifying the type & quantity of rats you have). Also, we rotated all the traps, so the rats had an equal chance at each trap. Additionally, the Victor Electronic successfully trapped/killed crickets, so we know the basic principle works.Results:*Victor Old Fashioned Rat Trap- 8 Norway Rats (caught 8 of 9)*Tomcat Rat Snap- 1 Norway Rat (caught 1 of 9, but did NOT kill it - maimed it, and left a bloody mess everywhere. This one gets an extremely reluctant recommendation, only if your rats are trap-shy around wood traps)*Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap- Zero (O)* D-Con Baitbits - Uncertain - They ate this but later were caught by a trap. These take 3-10 days to take effect, but then the carcass can wind up in a wall, under a floor, etc. Uncertain how much of a dose is necessary to kill a large rat such as a Norway. Probably would have worked by itself, but traps are preferred so you can measure effectiveness & dispose of carcass properly.*Tomcat Block Bait- Zero (0)* D-Con Rat Glue Traps - Zero (0) - This might work for mice, but an awful idea for rats. Just makes a mess - avoid!*Tomcat Old Fashioned Wood Trap- Zero (0), but the rat steals the bait every time. Tomcats do NOT snap. Just like a real Tomcat we once adopted - he would find rodents and play with them, tease them ... but not kill them. I even whacked the trap with a broom handle and it still didn't snap. Makes you wonder if the rat designed this one!Hope this helps - thanks!",1306281600,2011-05-25
1.0,"This nozzle seemed to be well made and it worked great for a few weeks.After about 2 months of occasional use (maybe used it 4-5 times during that time), the whole nozzle started to leak water everywhere. Another reviewer mentioned that the internal components of this nozzle are made from cheap plastic and will break easily from regular use, and it seems they were right.

4.0,"There are lots of decent kebob sets out there, and for the most part, all do their jobs acceptably well. Most are priced well below this set. But if you're as interested in presentation as much as you are taste, the higher price of this set is worth it.The shape and finish are very nice, and unlike a couple other reviewers, I found the quality of both workmanship and materials to be excellent. The double skewers do a great job of preventing skewered items from just rolling loosely when you attempt to turn your kebobs over for even cooking.There's plenty of room for nice big hunks of meats, vegetables, fruits, or whatever else you're skewering, too. Many other sets don't leave quite as much room between skewers on the rack, thereby limiting the size of anything you put on the skewers. The trade-off for being able to use larger pieces is that instead of 6 kebobs at a time, which is common with other sets like this, you can only grill five kebobs at a time with this one. That presents no problem here, as we rarely cook for more than four.The real payoff comes when you lift the rack with your finished kebobs out of your grill and carry it to where your guests will be served. They present so much more nicely on this rack. Of course they won't be on that rack for long, just long enough for your guests to see how nice it all looks before being served, but hey, first impressions mean a lot, right? And your guests are worth it!I hope some of you will find my review helpful in making a more informed decision as you consider your buying choices. Peace :-)",1344211200,2012-08-06

4.0,"In our family, the care and feeding of our yard is my job. While I'm generally comfortable working with a variety of trees, shrubs, herbs, and flowers, I welcome knowledgeable advice. That's why I was eager to put this helpful Parrot to work.I'll focus here on showing how the Parrot works out of the box and what it's like tapping into the specific data you gather and augmenting your knowledge with the plant library the app provides. Thus far, the unit and app both seem to be working well (including the day I let my plant dry out to see whether that would trigger a ""water me"" alert, which it did).Since I ""drive"" the Parrot with my phone, I was able to snap some screen shots for you. I've placed them, with annotations, in the customer images section on the product page.  These shots include live-action shots and historical data. The app archives data so that you can review in daily, weekly, and monthly view.  The Parrot unit gathers and stores data and transmits it via Bluetooth. The Flower Power app communicates with the ""Parrot Cloud"" by way of 3G, 4G or wifi.Setup is simple, but remind yourself that it takes at least 24 hours for the Parrot to generate its first report. In the meantime, you can dig into the Flower Power database, and start building your ""garden,"" by selecting other plants with which you will want to work. Each time your search nets a result, you can add that plant to your garden. You can personalize entries by taking photos of your plants, or use the images provided in the database. You have access to 6,000 plants.Be sure that the Flower Power app recognizes your physical location; this simple but necessary step helps with future use. Indeed, during initial use, I received notification that an update for my location (Hawaii) was available; depending on your location, you may receive a similar prompt.Speaking of locations, I am in Zone 10, which isn't ideal for some of the plants I would like to grow. However, I've checked through the app and located support for several flowers I plan to grow this year, including particular varieties of crocus and tulips. In years past, I've had varying results with these plants, so I hope that the Parrot will mean a better outcome this year.In order to make best use of the app, I would need to have multiple Parrot units. The workaround I've been using is to move the Parrot from one plant to the next on a weekly basis. In several more months, I will evaluate the overall benefit of the Parrot unit and the Flower Power database, and decide whether to buy additional units.If you have questions about the unit or the app, please post in the comments, and I will respond as soon as possible.",1392854400,2014-02-20
2.0,Its not as strong as I'd like it to be. Don't expect it to chop thick weeds. The worst part is the battery life. It takes hours of charging to get minutes of use,1345507200,2012-08-21
3.0,"There are 3 poles that one sticks in the ground; there's a deer attractant to draw them near, and it uses AA batteries to give the critters a mild shock.  Simple idea.The instructions tell you the limitations: one, it depends on the deer concentration; works best in the town where there are fewer; works least in a rural, non-residential setting.  We live rural-residential, and have lots of deer.  Secondly, it states it covers 1200 sq. ft.- that's like a 30' X 40' area.  Finally, it's affected by climate, i.e., moisture.We, in general, like having deer around; however, we want to keep them away from our flowers, trees, and garden.  I just bought some baby fruit trees, and it seems to work.  How long I don't know?You'll have to consider the cost and what you want to protect.  I think it's probably easier and more secure to use fencing, dogs, and chose plants deer don't eat.",1305590400,2011-05-17

That being said, I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely. The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while.

4.0,"This ""copper"" colored/finished metal bird feeder is very nice looking.  I like that it is a moderate size(8 x 10"") but holds a lot of seed(5 lbs).  The interior is made nicely with a piece that is at an angle and funnels the seed towards the openings.  It also has four drainage holes.  It has a nice cable lock down that secures the lid well and the bird perches are metal and attractive. Each see-through side is made of hard plastic.  In the sun, the plastic ends up cracking but it takes a few years for that.I don't like the cable that it hangs from that is a pewter color and doesn't match the copper.  The cable is just looped to hang from.  I think they could have made it at least match.I also just noticed that it is already rusting on the bottom after two days of rain!  Guess the didn't take the time to seal the bottom where water drips off!Although I am not happy about a few thins, if you are going for a nice, expensive look, this is your bird feeder.

5.0,"I love this perky, red hummingbird feeder!!  It is ~ 6  inches by 4 inches in size.  It has four soft, flexible flowers for the bird to feed from.  (Unlike the hard metal ones which I feel could harm the little guys.)  It is super to easy fill.  (Therefore, no mess.)  Just unscrew the plastic top and pour the sugar solution into the glass container.  The red color is cute and welcoming to the hummingbirds.  I have a bronze one and the birds bypass it. (Apparently they hummingbirds are very attracted to red.)  I also like that it has a built in ant moat -since we have a lot of ants in the garden I find this a very nice touch.  The only negative is that is comes with a flimsy S hook to hang.  Instead of using the hook I decided directly loop a sturdy rope through the open attachment on the feeder.This feeder is completely adorable, easy to clean/use and a hummingbird magnet.

4.0,"Charcoal made from coconut shells- who would imagine such a concept? Well, that is exactly what you get with Coshell charcoal briquettes, an environmentally- friendly alternative to ordinary charcoal. This product claims to burn longer and hotter than regular charcoal and since it is all- natural, it produces less waste and the leftovers can even be used as fertilizer.Given the lofty claims and uniqueness of this product, I was anxious to give it a try. Opening the bag, my first impression was mixed. The briquettes are more evenly shaped and smoother than ordinary charcoal, but I noticed that they were quite dirty, leaving a black, powdery coating on the hands. Oh well- at least they look good. So far, the product seems acceptable.Now, it was time for the real test: lighting the briquettes on fire and using them to cook some burgers and steaks. I noticed that the product took a little longer to catch fire, but once it was caught, the briquettes slowly turned gray in color and they held their heat for a good long time. Of all the positive qualities during the heating and cooking process, the one I remember best is the cleanliness of this product. It doesn't produce much smoke and it imparts almost no taste on the food.If there is anything negative to say about this product (aside from the initial handling), it would be the fact that coconut shells do not accomplish much in the way of adding flavor to the food. Like I said, they impart almost no taste difference due to their cleanliness and while this will be considered an asset to some, others will immediately give this product a failing grade because they will want to taste mesquite or at least some smokiness in their food. You don't get any added flavor benefits, so it is almost like cooking on a stovetop.Coconut shell briquettes are an interesting concept and this product is certainly an unusual one. I like that it is more environmentally- friendly than ordinary charcoal and I like knowing that there is no landfill waste to worry about. The powdery mess is an annoyance, but I still like this product overall and I consider it one worth trying.",1289433600,2010-11-11

The mop head was fantastic sopping up the marinade; however, I did experience a little difficulty in basting the meat; it seemed to gather up the sauce but not want to put it on the meat. Having said this, I still think it is fantastic. I was worried about the clean up but was pleasantly surprised that the mop head cleaned extremely well and dried in a small amount of time.

5.0,"I have a decent size lawn and yard.  I usually use two hoses, one for the front, one for the back.  I used to buy cheap department store hoses, but they usually didn&#8217;t last and would kink a lot.  The last time around I spent a bit more and got a better quality hose.  I found it was thicker and more durable, but still kinked often - even though it was advertises as &#8220;no kink.&#8221;  I have a lot of landscaping and as I wind around shrubs, flowers, rocks, trees, and paving, I almost always end up with a hose kinked, or stuck on something.  Then I have to stop what I am trying to do, go back and free up the hose, etc.Enter the Scotts MaxFex.  While it is still winter and my use of this hose has been limited, I have used it to wash the cars and flush a gutter.The hose measures 50 feet in length.  The couplings appear to be brass; they are marketed as being lead free.  The entire hose is advertised as lead-free, which makes it &#8220;drinking water safe.&#8221;This is not an inexpensive hose.  However, for the extra $10 or $20 you may spend, to me &#8211; it is well worth it.  The hose is clearly made very well.  The couplings are heavy duty and the hose has a nice feel to it.  You can see and feel that it is reinforced.  It has what Scotts calls &#8220;Lay Flat&#8221; technology.  Basically it tends to keep its shape, which helps it resist kinks.  They refer to it as being &#8220;kink resistant&#8221; which I am fine with, as I hate to buy a &#8220;kink free&#8221; hoses that kink.  At least here, they are telling you it should avoid kinks, but &#8211; just about anything flexible can kink.I keep my hoses in storage containers made for that purpose (decorative with a cylinder in the middle to wrap the hose around).  Even with my decent hoses, I tend to have to fight and exert some strength to roll the hose around and around into the container.  Yet with the MaxFlex, I found it recoiled quite nicely, allowing me to more easily roll it into the storage container.In the short time I have had it, this hose has demonstrated an ability to maintain shape, recoil very easily, and to avoid kinks.  In fact, not a single kink yet &#8211; again I have used it just 2 or 3 times.What has really pleased me is the way it keeps its shape and tends to continue to slide around things as you pull it, rather than become snagged on things.  People often complain about a hose that kinks, but to me snagging on things is just as bad.  I hate having to stop what I am doing, retrace my steps and go free up the hose from whatever it got caught on.  So far, this hose has tended to slide freely around objects and hasn&#8217;t snagged &#8211; even once.I will update the review as I continue to use it.To me, this hose is well worth the extra cost versus an average hose.  I am buying a second one for the yard.Scotts also backs it with a limited lifetime warranty.",1394150400,2014-03-07
5.0,"This Goal Zero 7 Solar panel charger is amazing.  I couldn't believe it actually works - it looks deceptively flimsy.  It is great for emergencies and backpacking -this is a versatile charger.  It is also very durable on the outside and light weight.  It charged my iphone, my kindle and the 4 included AA batteries.  Although it does not come with AAA batteries it does come with a clip/adapter where you can put AAA rechargeable batteries inside.  (I believe that you can buy AAA enelope rechargeable batteries and they will work.)  Since it is fall there wasn't much sun so I had to keep readjusting the screen for maximum impact.  I also notice the screen got scratches easily and I wonder if this affects charging in the long run.  Weather could be a big issue and frustration.  It works best in full sunlight when it gets overcast it didn't seem to charge at all for me.  Due to the poor sunlight, my batteries still did not fully charge the first day.  I did like that the battery charger has its own light which is good for emergencies and that it has a USB port to directly charge other items from it.  (I understand it is actually better to charge items other than the batteries directly from the battery charger and not directly from the system itself because the battery charger regulates the energy flow.  If you connect your phone or tablet directly from the system there will be fluctuation in power going to the items depending on the amount of light.)I really liked this item and was really impressed.

I was still able to convert it to a window box by sliding the installation tabs under my window frame, but ideally you'll be using this on a wood railing for the best results.2 x 4 or 2 x 6 railings would work best, or even a ledger board of that size on a brick or stucco exterior would work.  It adjusts in length so it's easy to find a planter box to fit inside at the local store (I found one at Ace hardware).  With the box inside it raises the flowers nicely for a good view from my window.The style is simple glossy dark brown with swirls, and they make matching plant stands that look cool with it.  All the bolts and slides were solid and well-made.However, I'm only giving it 3 stars because I think it should be more clear that it is not for windows.  I got it to work on mine but that was a fluke I think.

Actually had deer walk right by the stakes when they had only been out 1 day and the ""acorn scented"" lure did nothing in attracting them.

Of course, then you would have to wait awile for it to repower to shock again.  On that point alone it would work on the deer. What we are going to try next is just putting all the stakes in a line to try to keep the deer from entering the area we're trying to protect.

My shed has also been home to larger rodents.I have tried a number of traps and poisons to deal with the problem. It is hard to know how well a trap or poison is working at any given moment because I tend to get mice at certain times of the year like the colder months or when a family of mice have decided to live in my shed or garage. During a bad winter in New Jersey I went through a lot of mice poison and caught a number of mice. I have seen little activity this spring which has been mild. Different brands of mice poison seem to work better at different times.The Tomcat mouse killer bait stations are nice because they are covered and the poison comes included in the trap so I did not need to wear gloves while handling the poison myself. I use these inmy basement.  The bait station is small. I have used larger bait stations. It looks like it is safe if children and pets are around because it is disposable so it would be hard to get into it.

Keep watered and wait for vegetable and herb plants to emerge from soil.  That's it! :)  *sips espresso*Everything one needs is already in the peat pod - except the surrounding soil, water and sunshine.There is a handy paper spacing ruler on back of packaging band to help with spacing of seed pods.  The fold out instruction pamphlet is extremely useful, and loaded with tips and tricks. ...even includes a Fresh herb Vinaigrette recipe one can quickly make and enjoy over home grown vegetable salad.Some vegetables need to be started indoors, and then planted outdoors.  Not a big deal, just an extra step to insure that that particular plant safely emerges into this world!  The cardboard pod holder makes a wonderful stand for starting indoors.  Just leave pods in place, place stand in waterproof dish (like an old cookie sheet with sides), peel off seed pod label, water.I found that the peel off tops of the pods (info labels) are laminated (to a certain extent) and can be used as plant markers -- so one knows what-is-where.  I used wooden chopsticks and just threaded label onto the stick and stuck it in the soil beside the planted pod.  Even after a couple of torrential rains I am still able to read the label.In less than a week, my cucumber and bush bean had emerged, I kid You not! :)Does the Miracle-Gro Gro-ables Salad and Herb Garden Kit sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Would make a Fantastic Gift, or project!

5.0,"This is a mower for anybody who doesn't want to deal with the gas powered mower and all the hassle that that brings, but also doesn't want to wander around the yard during a stupid extension cord constantly trying to make sure it doesn't get run over or pulled out of the socket. I got the chance to pick up this mower right about the time our old electric mower was beginning to die. It is little bigger and more unwieldy, but it's also nice to have the self powered motion.The mower lives up to its promises starting immediately the first time every time. There's this weird little key that you can take out if you want to be safe and not have it start up, but nothing stops you from just leaving it in either. With the key in you can immediately squeeze the handle bar to make the mower propel itself forward. One thing I should warn you though, always remember that you can let go of the handle to make the mower stop; it's human nature to hold onto the handle harder when it is moving forward away from you, but this is exactly the wrong thing to do. My wife very nearly ran into a hedge but I was able to yell to her to let go and the mower stopped immediately. I should mention that the mower is entirely rearwheel drive, with the front two wheels being nothing but support. The front tires are slightly cheesy compared to the back ones, but I don't think they're going to fall off or anything.I've had no problems doing my entire lawn on a single charge. The battery has a handy indicator on it you can use to view the amount of charge you have remaining, though you do have to stop the mower and press a button to see it. My lawn isn't all that big and I don't use the self propulsion all the time so your mileage may vary, but really the battery life is pretty decent and unless your yard is huge I don't think you'll have much problem. Unfortunately if the battery does run out, you're pretty much out of luck until it's recharged. There's no way to use the mower on an extension cord without the battery.I've no complaints about the grass cutting. I mentioned that it started reliably, really all you have to do is hold down a handle bar and press a button.  It's not quite the one touch but it claims on the package, but adjusting the height of the mower is extremely simple. You don't have to be strong or have any mechanical inclination. It's much easier than a lot of lot of mowers I've seen. The grass cutting is smooth even one somewhat damp grass; the blade is quite sharp and moves fast. I have yet to have the mower choked on an especially large piece of grass like my old one would. There is a mulch bag attachment so you can have the grass clippings dumped into a bag instead of on the ground. I usually just leave the grass on the ground, but if it's become very thick and I don't want the grass clippings to choke off the sunlight I'll use it.  The bag is extremely easy to take on and off.It's a fairly large lawnmower so on bigger lawns the mower might be a little bit heavy for you to push around without using the self propulsion.  If you have a lot of really tight areas to get into, I don't know if I'd recommend this for that. If you got the normal yard or you can go little bit over onto the pavement and clipping the grass then you'll be fine. It takes up little more room with the bag attached, but even without it is a little big in the garage. The only way to make it much smaller is to bend the handlebar forward, but if you're doing that all the time it could start to get a little loose.  Just a ballpark guess, plan on needing maybe 5'-6' by 2.5'-3' to store it comfortably when not folding it up.I may be a weirdo, but the thing that impresses me more than anything is that it has two methods of charging. This is important to me because I'm always worried that something will happen to damage the charger area of rechargeable product. Here you have the option of either charging the mower battery while still in the mower or removing the battery and charging it anywhere. This is especially helpful one mower is supposed to be stored for the season. The manual states the battery is happiest when it is constantly charging. This would make it a little awkward to charge the battery while still in the mower if you're storing it, but since you can remove the battery it's easy to put it out of the way. If you're like me you're worried that the battery would cost a lot of money to charge all the time, but this isn't the case. I hooked the charger up to myBelkin Conserve Insight F7C005q Energy-Use Monitorand left it for about a week. Once it is fully charged and was only taking a small trickle, the meter estimated it would only cost around a dollar and thirty cents to a dollar and forty cents a year to operate. The only thing about charging that annoys me is the charger is obviously not an outdoor model; that means you either have to keep the mower in your garage or shed or take the battery out to charge it safely.The packaging is on the flimsy side and was nearly destroyed when it got to me.  It's possible I got a unit with a design defect, because the left front wheel was messed up when it arrived. With some help from a family member we got the axle bent back a tiny bit and now the tire turns correctly. We also had to slightly bend the metal bit that holds the handle on so it would properly lock in place. I'm not counting off for that because I suspect it was just dropped in transit and after we bent those things to the correct position everything functions perfectly.  Just fair warning that it's an off possible you might have to send the mower back for a new one, but Amazon has top notch customer return support so an exchange would be easy.In my opinion this is a very good mower that I would recommend to friends or family. You could probably find something little cheaper, but probably not something with as many features or quality of design you get with this on.  I do kind of wonder how many years the battery will last so I still kind of lean more towards liking ones with chords (even though they're annoying to deal with), but I trust this one's battery more than I would trust some non-namebrand mower.  I'm sure I'll get a lot of years use out of it.  Great mower.",1304899200,2011-05-09

This takes off the dust but also leaves a light (not overpowering) shine that makes leaves look healthier.The nozzle sprays just the right amount onto the leaf (though directions recommend you hold a cloth to catch overspray) and the whole process is fairly painless (as painless as a process can be when you have a plant with a lot of leaves).The shine has lasted for two weeks now and the product doesn't seem to be collecting dust faster onto the leaves.,1403049600,2014-06-18
5.0,"For years, I've been using a larger 22"" weber grill, but when I moved recently I decided to get one a bit smaller to conserve charcoal.  After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews, I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver.  It is absolutely unbeatable, and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye!  While it doesn't have an adjustable-height grilling surface, it's quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you're looking for.  I've been able to sear fish, or slow-cook buffalo wings, just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement.  I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal, not briquettes, and both work equally well in this grill.  Cleaning is a breeze, and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago, hasn't even come close to needing it.As far as build quality goes, I really like the solid feel of the grill overall, but the legs could stand to be a bit sturdier.  They aren't as weak as some reviewers have said, but it certainly is the weakest point of the grill as a whole.  The plastic handle has never gotten too hot to handle, not as some reviewers said.  The diameter of the grill could stand to be about 1/4"" larger, to keep it from wiggling around so much when you're brushing it.  The vents constructions seems fantasic, they are easy to open and close, yet stay put when you need them to.  Having easy access to both top and bottom vents allows for lots of experimentation with cooking temperatures.  I love this grill to death, and I point out that fact to my fiance every time i use it (""see, i told you this thing is friggin' awesome!"").  Even when I buy myself a much larger charcoal grill in the near future, I will still use this grill every time I'm only cooking for 1 or 2 people.",1242518400,2009-05-17

5.0,"I'd rather not target squirrels. As destructive as they can be, they are cute and quite entertaining. Our indoor cats are glued to the ""cat TV"" for hours, watching them from their window perches.Unfortunately, squirrels are scampering about the outside of our house as the temperatures outside drop and the squirrels are looking for winter quarters. Several neighbors have had their houses penetrated, now the squirrels have taken a liking to ours. Having grown tired of the squirrels climbing up and down our home in search of food and/or an entry point, I set this trap on our porch, covered it with a layer of plastic wrap (to keep moisture out) and baited the unit with peanut butter. 12 hours later the first squirrel expired. Disposal was trivial, the squirrel slid easily into the trash bag. The unit is back in operation, awaiting the its next customer.I hope the squirrels stay off our house. But if they choose not to, this trap is probably the most humane way to dispose of them (catch and release is not allowed in my state).EDIT: Three squirrels in four days... The only downside to this unit is it's lack of environmental protection - it would be great to be able to safely / easily use it outside also. I guess I would use a plastic tote with a hole like the folks at RatZapper...Later Edit: More customers... and I finally figured out why some squirrels escaped: In their attempt to get at the bait without going into the tunnel, some squirrels will rotate the trap - I had thought it had been the 'throes of electric passion' when I found the trap upturned (envisioning a electricity-proof squirrel mutation). But once the plates are no longer on the bottom, the trap is safe to enter. Moral of the story: secure the trap so it stays upright.Even later edit: One of the electrodes came loose, as the earlier manhandling by squirrels (when the trap was not installed rigidly) had broken one of the pins holding the bottom of the tunnel to the body. I used 5 minute epoxy to glue the bottom back onto the body and glued the middle and back plates on too - they were just held with double-sided tape. Trap's back out... ready for additional customers.",1323043200,2011-12-05
5.0,"I have only had this trap for two and a half days, but I feel safe in giving this trap five stars because I have already caught six squirrels and one chipmunk.  I will say that it is hard to set the sensitivity high enough to catch the chipmunks and chipmunks can steal the bait.  Still, this works because I have caught two squirrels when there was no bait at all.  I have yet to leave this for more than two hours and not find a squirrel.Some other reviews have mentioned modifying this to make it sensitive enough.  For squirrels I have not needed to modify mine, but I do try to leave the set switch on as lightly as I can.  At first I tried to put the trigger just barely on, but now I put it on all of the way, and then back it down until it is barely engaged.  That seems to work well for me.",1315612800,2011-09-10

5.0,"This is the first compact, expandable hose I've ever used and I am quite impressed with its portability. I've bought a number of hoses in my life - and something always happens to the hose to make it worthless. The cheap hoses give you a lot of length for very low cost - but they kink within minutes of unwrapping them from their manufactured packaging. I've spent big money on the high-end hoses that don't kink - but they are so heavy and cumbersome. You have to roll them up - eventually you just leave them out and something happens to bend/crimp the metal end to make them unusable.There are drawbacks to any scenario - including this compact hose. You have to fill it completely (which is kinda fun the first time around) to build up the pressure to expand it before you can start to use it. This isn't the kinda hose you just let trickle while taking a sip at the other end - it's not a pressure washer per se, but you have to have the nozzle on the business end for it to work. When you're done using the hose, you have to let the water get out of it so it can retract to storage size.We live out in the country, so a pile of hose is an invitation for snakes, spiders and other unseemly creatures to huddle. I like that this is so light weight and portable, that I can quickly remove it and put it in storage when it's not in use and its long enough that I can use it just about anywhere in our yard.The fabric will pick up dirt, pollen, etc. - but there are trade offs for any gizmo you get. The pluses outweigh the negatives in my book.",1398643200,2014-04-28

Not being terribly squirrly myself I can't claim to know why the squirrels were yanking my flowers out but that is my guess.  I put this stuff around the flowers and have not had any issues since.  I am making a leap of faith that the granules are the reason why the squirrels have not returned.  They are still in the yard but have not bothered the plants.

The front is thick clear plasticwhich has all edges finished and strengthened with metal.The clear front makes it nice to view the level, and is bite resistant to squirrels.This is perfect to hang on our privacy fence among the bittersweet vine which is a favorite area of birds.The feeder is a bit smaller then I expected, 9 1/2"" tall x 4 1/4"" wide, (roof 6 1/4"") and of courseit's flat on it's back side for hanging on a post or wall, still it holds a decent amount of food (3 cups)and has an attractive appearance.The instructions with the feeder says the top slides up the hanger to open for filling, which isn't correct.The hanger is only a hanger  It can be removed / or used to hang the feeder / or flipped down out of the way.because there's also a hole on the back side of the feeder for hangingBetween the two options I chose to use the stainless steel hanger for a couple of reasons.> 1. When the hole is used, the feeder is flat against the fence which won't allow the hinged top to open.> 2. Because of same issue ^ the feeder needs completely filled before hanging back up,but then the food covers the view of the hole making it difficult to find.The feeder is good quality ~ well constructed ~ an attractive.Update March 15, 2014 - The birds found the feeder later same day as hanging (10 days ago) & been using it since.It appears with the feeder in the middle of the privacy fence birds feel safer because our outdoorcats can't stalk them there, and so far squirrels haven't bothered feeder either.",1393977600,2014-03-05
5.0,"I bought this last year so this is the first spring I have had to use it.  I am seriously impressed.  I am using it for popping out weeds, hacking down dead vegetation and planting.  It doesn't dig a wide hole and does not work as well as a trowel for removing dirt while planting, but it works much better than a trowel to plant in my horribly rocky clay areas and the blade makes it easy to puncture a hole to put the plant tag.The sharpness of this is tool makes it extremely useful.  I think the serrated blade will make sharpening difficult, but for this price it is well worth getting a new one when it gets dull.  I will definitely do so and am buying some for gifts for my fellow gardening friends.Also, if you wonder what the difference between the models 1515 and 1516, according to the company's web site this one is a stainless version of the black 1515.",1305936000,2011-05-21

The poison is Bromethalin and it has an advantage over the coumadin poisons that some mice get resistant to. I've never had a problem with mice that were resistant to coumadin but I understand it does happen. This poison causes the mice to become paralyzed, be unable to breathe or move, and die quickly.The problem I have with this product is that my cats eat mice.  Though I don't worry about my cats getting into the poison in these tamper resistant bait stations, the Bromethalin poison that is the main ingedient persists in the food chain. I don't dare take a chance on my cats eating a mouse that's ate the poison. When I got the product, I really didn't realize that Bromethalin persisted in the food chain like it does or I'd not have got itOf course this won't bother people that don't have cats or people that don't have cats that eat mice.  They'll most likely find this a very convenient solution that offers the mouse a fairly quick sure death.  These stations are not messy at all, though you will have to locate the mice and throw them away.  They generally would not die too far away from where they ate this particular poison.  It's quicker acting and I don't think there's been any mice that have got resistant to it.  Some mice are resistant to the more common poison that is coumadin.",1403654400,2014-06-25

3.0,"The havahart live animal cage s easy to set up, sturdy and well built.  It resembles the cage we borrowed from the humane society last year but for the size.  The Havahart trap is smaller to prevent the capture of larger animals.  While I wish some of my neighbors would be more responsible about their pets, I have no desire to trap them.  The smaller openings on this cage prevent such mishaps.I have a small vegetable garden which has been under siege.  I have tried a number of things to prevent mauraders. This is the latest in a series.  Last year we borrowed a trap from our local humane society and frequently awoke to trapped rodents.  I had not been sure what was attacking my garden but it seems the rats were certainly involved.I have not yet caught anything in the Havahart trap, but then I am not hearing them as I usually do.  I suppose time will tell.The trap was easy to set and bait and looks equally as easy to release.  The trap offers one or two door operation.  It comes set up for 2 door use.  For 2 door use, pull back on the spring loaded handle laying it back against the cage.  That pulls the doors open, preparing the trap for use.  Place bait inside on the far side of the pressure sensitive plate. To use with one door simply unhook the cable from the loop on top of the cage and set the same way as for 2 door use.My only qualm, and the reason I gave it 3 stars. is that I wish the carry handle was larger.  I do not like the idea of my hand being that close to a rodent or other wild animal. (The instructions advise use of gloves while carrying a trapped animal.)  The setting handle provides a good deal of clearance from the cage. The carrying handle, however, does not, something I find worrisome.Easy to set and releaseWell built and sturdyDesigned for rodents and small pests: Small door keeps pets and larger animals out.Carrying handle on the short side putting your hand too close to animal for comfort or safety",1401580800,2014-06-01

4.0,"This item is solid and actually pleasant to look at.  You would not know it was a mouse trap unless told.  It is very simple to work, you pull out a small plug, you fill the tiny little cup, about 1/8 tsp, full of peanut butter, and replace with a twist. You then turn the red handle to the furthest point where it will click into place, the tiny little red door will open showing where the critters will enter and that is it.You place the unit where you think there might be mice.  I know how and where they get into my house but if you don't, simply place this unit along a baseboard.  It is recommended that you use more than one per room.The idea is that the little mouse will enter that tiny little hole, and believe me they can get in that tiny hole, and the arm will slam and do the deed.When I first moved to my new home I was not aware of mice, when I heard scratching in my attic I knew it was time for  action.  I tried everything not to have to actually kill them,  That went on for 8 months but when my dog came in the living room with a tail wiggling out of his mouth I knew I had to take drastic actions. So I started to use traps, some worked and some didn't.The best part of this trap is that it seals any and all bodily fluids in the trap, it closes them off so neither you nor your family will have to come into contact with them.There are no poisons of any kind it is all done with force and your peanut butter so it is safe for children and pets, just in cast they get close you have no worries.I knew it would not take long, since I always have a mouse around somehere, after the snow went away and the new snow started I guess they came running in from the cold, again. I kept checking the ones in the kitchen but I forgot the one in the spare room, well this morning I had one.

5.0,"We have been using this Tomcat product for quite some time now; using it in the pure block form and without a feeder box.  Our primary problem here is field mice.  We go through periodic infestations in our barns, sheds and indeed, back porch.  The reason for this is that there is feed and seed stored in each of these places.  I personally have nothing against field mice...I sort of like the little critter to be honest with you, but they can cause a lot of damage, spread disease and eat a tremendous amount of grain when they decide to move in with you.We have found the bait (the green cakes) to be pretty effective most of the time.  No extermination method works 100 percent of the time for ever but the results of this stuff over the past two years or so has been quite good.  It has cut down on the mouse population a lot and most of the problems we have are the constant stream of new comers.I like this particular refillable bait station.  It is easy to load, the little critters will not haul off the bait, and this station is quite effective in keeping dogs, cats and kids out of it.  You can also see through the top as to weather or not the bait is being used and when the thing should be refilled.  The plastic is quite sturdy and very water resistant under normal circumstances.Now we do not find dead bodies of mice all over the place as I suppose they crawl off and die someplace.  We sort of measure our success by the number of sighting of the actual mice, the number of droppings we find and the number of seed sacks we find chewed upon.  So far the results of this stuff has been quite good.  I prefer it to using the snap-kill traps and most certainly prefer it to the free flowing seed form of mouse killer that is so popular.We have been and are satisfied with this product.  It is relatively hassle free.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",1396396800,2014-04-02

5.0,"Hummingbirds are some of my favorite tweets and as a consequence I've acquired a number of Perky-Pet feeders. One reason I like them is that they're affordable, and I've been able to get replacement parts like bee-guards which have kept my older feeders useful and clean.This current Perky-Pet model, the 209B, is really nice. It's got an ant moat at the top and little rails for the Hummers to rest on all the way around.  One of my favorite features though is the ease of cleaning and filling.  Cleaning is particularly important because while making a mess is just my problem (one that can easily be corrected), an unclean feeder can make the birds sick.The wider mouth glass battle on this unit makes filling and cleaning easy.  The glass bottle also threads into the base like a regular bottle/cap arrangement which has kept leakage to a minimum for me.Cleaning the base is easy as the bottom comes apart in two pieces, and I've found that if you take most of the fuzz off of a Q-tip that you can scrub the inside of the flowers, keeping them clear of debris and slimy buildup.The only downside would be the red dye in the sugar Perky Pet supplies. No one recommends food dye any longer. Use it --if you must-- but then use just regular sugar and water to provide nutrition to the birds.  The formula couldn't be easier. 1-cup cooled-boiled water or bottled water (without fizz or chlorine or additives of any sort) and 1/4-cup white regular sugar.  Mix and serve.This is a HUGE feeder, by the way, and I only fill mine with 1-cup of sugar-water because we don't get that many hummers (unfortunately too near the woods) and in the heat of summer it will go bad in a couple of days.

5.0,"I got theCobraCo FB6102 Round Cast Iron Brick Finish Fire Pit with Screen and Covera few months back and have liked it. That fire pit came with its own plastic cover that fits it perfectly. The problem is, it is absolutely useless if you want to keep water out of the fire pit. Water just seeps right through it as if it were a sieve.I found a pool of standing water in the pit about a month ago where mosquitoes were breeding. Nice. Not only that, but the screen that fits over the pit has now started to rust because of the water problem.I resolved to get a better cover for the fire pit. Having had a very good experience with theClassic Accessories 55-142-055101-EC Ravenna Grill Cover, X-Large, Tauperecently, I looked for a fire pit cover from the same company and found the Classic Accessories Ravenna Round Fire Pit Cover, Taupe.This cover did the trick. Not only does it look nice, but it is obviously more durable than the cover that came with the pit. Drawstring closures on both sides let you adjust the fit for your pit and keep the cover from blowing off. It also has clasps that you can put around the legs of your pit to hold the cover in place. Handles on top of the cover make it easy to lift the cover off.We've had some good thunderstorms since I got this cover and the pit has stayed dry through all of them.I'm very happy with this cover and with the Classic Accessories brand in general. I will look at their product line again should I have need for something else they make in the future.",1378944000,2013-09-12
4.0,"I had thought this would have been the right product for me to get rid of a couple troublesome mice that have been getting in my shed. Turns out that this is not the case.The hole where the mouse goes in is just too small for the breed of mice in my area. I was expecting to just go back out there after a couple days and be able to just dispose of the pesky rodents and go on about my business, unfortunately not the case. So I sat out there one day while working on some things and noticed a mouse trying to get into the trap but it couldn't fit it's head in the whole. It's not like we have rats out here or anything, just simple mice.Rather disappointing.While I did end up catching 2 others with the boxes and disposing of them I still had to deal with the larger one of the group with a normal trap. Too bad they couldn't have been a little more accommodating and made the traps a little more universal.I still rate them high though due to the fact that they are rather effective and clean up is extremely easy, just pick them up and toss them.",1288224000,2010-10-28
4.0,"This is my first-ever pair of pruning shears so I have no way to compare them with other pruners.  Having never used a pruner before, I wished it would have come with more directions than it did; for instance, I had no idea which side of the blade to hold ""upwards"" for the best cutting leverage, and it says the blade tension is adjustable, but I have no idea how to adjust it.  It does have a diagram on blade replacement on the card (but no part number listed for the replacement blades).I ordered this to help with trimming down a burning bush that had grown all the way up to the soffit and gutters and had grown completely out of control.  Then for cutting the branches up so they would fit in my trash cart.  It worked great for that.Kind of hard to tell the size here from the picture, they are about 11"" long.  The description says they are good for up to 1 inch in diameter.  Maybe I'm just not strong enough, but I had to use a small hand saw to cut through the wooden branches that were an inch thick.  I tried at first using the pruners with a two-handed method for more cutting strength, however I was afraid I'd break the pruner.  Even though these come with a great full lifetime warranty, I didn't want to chance breaking them by stressing them out too much.  Maybe I would have done better with a ratcheting pruner, but as long as these made my job easier, I'm happy.So I used the hand saw on my large branches that were basically old wood and for anything more green and soft, "" and under, the pruners worked fine.  Being ergonomically correct, they are comfortable in the hand, and went through the smaller branches like a hot knife cuts through butter.After pricing some locally, you can't go wrong buying your pruners here at Amazon.",1288569600,2010-11-01

4.0,"This pot holder is really sturdy, much more than any other pot holder I have tried of its size.  It also has a lot of flexibility in the size of the brackets to adjust to different railings or fences.I tried this flower pot holder out in a couple of places before I found one that had the best sunlight and water possibilities - morning sun and only partial cover by a porch roof.  Then I decided on a great kindness to the plant, a vine that doesn't like trouble, and I put it on the side of the fence that faces my husband's garden instead of mine.  His side has about 90% better chance (okay, 100%) of being watered in a timely manner.  I have the general attitude that if plants are meant to live, they will -- except during the drought, and then even I showed better sense than that.The only thing I could have wished from this would be for a little more depth.  The size of the pot that will fit in here really is 7 inches at the bottom.  I repotted the vine I was putting in here to make it shorter but I may have trouble with the vine later.  :D",1371772800,2013-06-21
2.0,"I was excited to try this out because about a month ago we had a mice problem in our house. I used the Nooski in an area that the mice seemed to love and I also had two snap traps down. I ended up catching 5 mice with the snap traps and none with the Nooski, all using the same bait. We may have also had a misfire once, we're not sure if it was a mouse or something we did.One positive about the Nooski is that it is supposed to be safe for your pets. That's one thing that concerns me with the snap traps and I have to make sure I put them only in places the pets can't get to.I wish this would have worked but we just didn't have any luck with it. The snap traps remain the most effective for us.",1358380800,2013-01-17
4.0,Because of my bad back I've had to get rid of another trimmer which was too heavy. This model is light-weight and powerful and does a great job. I can twist the handle and use it as an edger. One flaw - the only problem I've had is that the screw holding the bottom plastic foot protector came out and I had to use a bit of epoxy and a smaller screw to put it back on. My back appreciates this light-weight trimmer,1335916800,2012-05-02
4.0,"The Perky-Pet bird feeder is solid metal, attractive and simple to use.  It is not huge, but is perfect for the corner of a small garden. It does hold about a pound and a half of bird seed.  It is easy to fill and the birds love it.  There are two long windows in the feeder so one can see how many seeds remain in it from a distance.The feeder is supposed to 'discourage' squirrels and leave the goodies to the birds.  I have the feeder hanging from a long wrought iron hook attached to an eight foot 4&#34;x4&#34; post.  The post is about eight or ten feet from any trees.  I have not seen a squirrel attacking my new feeder yet and hope I never do.The issues with the cap on the top of the seed tube that others have complained about have not materialized for me.  It comes off easily for filling and goes back on just as easily with a bit of alignment and a slight push.The only surprise I had was how it was necessary to tap the seed port hoods and perches into alignment when the feeder arrived.  That was no big deal, but I would have thought the feeder might be properly assembled in the first place.  Perhaps the thing was bumped in shipping.  Anyhow, I took off a star for that small problem.  Otherwise the Perky-Pet 740 is working out well.",1393372800,2014-02-26

3.0,"The Squirrel Be Gone birdfeeder is undeniably attractive.  Painted fire engine red, it is shaped like a barn, with a tray that is meant to just bear the weight of birds, nothing heavier while they access the feed from small openings, with a metal handle that fits in the side holes for hanging and a little weathervane piece on top, which by twisting you can open the removable roof part and fill the feeder with seed.Mine, however, was shipped without any kind of instructions in the box, although I was careful to make sure I didn't throw anything resembling them away by accident.  I received it in several pieces: four bolt parts, the barn part, a red base-looking part (which I assumed was meant to provide some kind of ""anchor""), plus the handle which attached to the sides.  Feeling vaguely like a preschooler with a Fisher Price toy, I untwisted the weathervane handle and tried to bolt the big red base piece onto the bottom with the screws using the appropriate screwdriver. They kept falling out, regardless of how much I tried to tighten them, although the smaller ""anchor"" part stayed on without bolts.  The next step was to figure out where the bolts did go.  Unfortunately, repeated examination of the holes did not yield the answer.  Two holes on either side were meant to attach the silver handle, which I did without trouble. So far, I can put the feeder out on a flat surface or table, so the birds can enjoy the feed, but I doubt that that's going to keep out the squirrels.Overall, the feeder does look like it would be successful to foil most squirrels, but I can't really grade it on that. So I'll give it three stars, and hope that other reviewers are much more helpful.  I don't know whether it was the lack of instructions, some glitch in the specific feeder I got, or my own incompetence that's responsible for this experience, so I'll just wish anyone who does purchase the feeder luck.",1363305600,2013-03-15
4.0,"If you haven't tried a hummingbird feeder I encourage you to try setting up a feeder.  They are amazing creatures.This feeder has a smaller volume than I am used to, but that is ok since the nectar needs to be replaced fairly quickly (want to be careful about leaving it to ferment out in hot summer weather).This feed is nice and elegant.  It has a good look to it. And the plastic bottom piece snaps on and off for cleaning (overall piece screws off of the bottle).Two things I am not overjoyed about with the feeder... 1. the piece to hook into at the top seems to be a bit awkward, it is a bent piece of metal that connects to a ring around the bottle.  2. The red flowers seem to be small for the feeder.  I think that makes the feeder a little harder to find for the birds.  For these reasons I took off 1 star.Suggestions for getting the birds to find you:  If you haven't had a feeder in your area before, I suggest getting some red flowers from a store to put near the feeder.  I believe that will help the hummingbirds find you.If you haven't done it before, the nectar is easy to make... heat up sugar and water at a ratio of 1 part sugar to 4 parts water (I heat to just boiling and let cool).A feeder I like even more isBirdscapes 710 Brushed Metal 12-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder... is a little more elegant to my taste.",1345593600,2012-08-22
5.0,"After reading Amy Stewart's book The Earth Moved: On the Remarkable Achievements of Earthworms, I was immediately taken with the idea of inviting these sweet little beasties into my home, or rather my backyard. Worm castings are great for starting seeds or container gardening of any kind because they are nutritious and help hold moisture in the soil or potting medium. I just scatter my spare castings into my vegetable garden to help improve the soil.The instructions with this bin will lead you to believe you should microwave your food scraps and chop them up tiny for your worms - but they're being way over-cautious. My worms seem perfectly happy with slightly shredded (all vegetable!) kitchen scraps (non-microwaved!), and the worms are about the lowest-maintenance ""pet"" I've had. I check on them whenever I add new kitchen scraps, every 3-4 days or so, and they rarely need anything from me beyond their lettuce and melon bits - every couple months some new shredded newspaper seems to be called for - other than that, they just churn out worm castings and take care of kitchen scraps in a pretty effortless way!If you want to be all gung-ho and learn about worm composting more, you can read Worms Eat my Garbage by Mary Appelhof. This does come with an instructional DVD though, so that will get you well on your way!(Note: This worm bin doesn't come with worms. You can buy red worms separately.)",1296777600,2011-02-04

5.0,"I couldn't be more happy with this product.  It is very attractive and well built.  The design allows each receptacle to contain either seed (or by flipping it upside down) water.  My birds don't seem to be drinking the water though perhaps they will as we get deeper into summer and natural water sources get harder to find.  If they don't take an interest in it by then, I'll have the option to put seed on both sides.  I can even experiment with two different kinds of seeds to see what attracts which type of bird.  The curlicue fixture from which these hang gives the entire thing a little bit of movement, like the balance of a scale, which may help to dissuade squirrels or other undesirables from getting into your birdseed.

4.0,"Item arrived promptly from Amazon. All items in the box. Followed instructions.  Cut 3 branches and the chain fell off. Installing the chain in a 5 hand job.  Got the chain back on, and cut 2 more branches before the chain fell off.  Took the whole thing to a local hardware store, where the staff uninstalled and reinstalled the chain.  They said the original chain was beyond dull. Spent $17.95 for a replacement chain. Went home and had the same problems.  Tried the new chain, and again was able to cut two branches before the chain fell off.  Sending this back to Amazon.  I don't know if I got a completely defective device or what, but a saw that doesn't cut is worthlessUpdate:After a visit to the local Black & Decker store (10 miles away and gas isn't cheap)it turns out the chain has two sides.  No where in the instructions does it say the chain has 2 sides or explain how to look at the chain and see which side goes in and which side goes out. Since the folks at the local hardware store didn't realize this was the problem, I don't feel so stupid. It turns out my replacement chain was packaged backwards, and the packaging didn't mention the 2 side issue either. For the 99% of the US population that doesn't use a chain saw on a daily basis, clear instructions on chains would be helpful.Update Two:Chain still won't stay on. I'm on chain 3. When it works, it works great. I get about 3 cuts, and the chain comes lose. My next door neighbor has tried it out (he has chainsaw experience) and it did the same thing to him. He says my unit is defective. I took the unit back to the local Black and Decker service center, and the nice kid at the front desk had never seen one. Boy, that leaves a customer with confidence. I'm going back to the service center with chunks of tree limbs and let a service tech try making more than 3 cuts.  It's always more helpful with something fails for the repair tech.Update Three--One year later:Now have owned for 1 year.  I had a gardener who was a logger in a different life use this product.  At first, he had the same problems as I did. After much tweaking and bolt adjustment, it worked fine.  He loved it.  I think there is a very fine line from great to terrible on this product, and if there is the slightest manufacturing irregularity, this tool requires someone with a lot of chainsaw experience to make it work properly. If someone gets a unit that just doesn't work as advertised, I'd strongly advise they have someone who works with chainsaws on a regular basis look at the unit before it is returned.I have still downgraded to 4 stars because I had to have someone else make this work.",1347926400,2012-09-18

1.0,"Written in the blush of new ownership:  Let's be clear, this is not a go into the forest and cut wood for the winter chainsaw.  I bought this saw to use as a shop tool for preparation of blanks for woodturning.  Having said that, it cuts very well, has sufficient power for the purpose, is not too loud and is well balanced.  It is well made for the duty for which it is designed.  Several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic.  Mine is metal.  It looks like it might be pretty light, but it is metal.I expect it to hold up well under the use that I intend for it.  I would expect it to hold up for normal home tree maintenance use.  I would not expect it to hold up to days of bucking logs.Cold experience:  Over the past 10 months or so, I have cut about 10 short log sections into chunks and cut some vertically for bowl blanks.  I don't think this constitutes a lot of use.  The painted name on the bar is barely marred.  The chain is still quite sharp.  Today I was cutting a log vertically which is the easiest cut for a saw as you are cutting with the grain.  Chain is nice and sharp, everything is great, except suddenly the motor is running and the chain is still.  Fast forward through a lot of diagnostic stuff to learn that the sprocket in the inside of the saw is in fact plastic and has in fact melted.  I was looking at the outside sprocket when I said it was metal.My money was completely wasted.  This saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated.

I somehow doubt it is big enough for a really long heavyweight hose, however.  That is why I haven't tried it yet for hose storage.  I'm debating if I should or not. I really don't think it was made for that type of hose.This container is made of lattice steel, and I'm also not sure if that would start to rust quickly.  It does have drainage holes in the bottom.  If it's not prone to rusting, you could also use it as a container for canned or bottled beverages for a cookout.  Just keep filling it with ice.  There are actually lots of other things you can do with it, besides hose storage.  You can easily unscrew the center piece, and then use the container to hold a large potted plant, or a small potted tree--both real or artificial, both inside or outside of the house.  You can use it to store things on your patio, such as small garden equipment and garden gloves.  It comes with a pretty matching lid, but the lid does not fit on tightly.  Thus, you might hear it being knocked off at night by a raccoon, hoping the container is a small green trash can.

5.0,"I already have a couple of these that I've been using for years.  The units hold up well, but the covers don't hold up as long.  I don't use them to start my plants in.  I do that inside with heated mats and overhead lighting that can be adjusted.  I use these racks to harden off my seedlings prior to planting or hold plants I've purchased until planting time.  If you start your own tomato, pepper and other plants from seed, they can gradually acclimate to living outdoors using these handy racks.Only the top shelves will accomdate taller plants, but my seedlings are planted in the garden before they get too tall.  Sometimes I've needed the height if I purchased plants that were already quite tall.Most of my vegetable gardening is done in earthboxes.  We have a serious squirrel and slightly lessor rabbit problem in our area.  The squirrels will continually dig whereever I've planted things and the birds will quickly grab any seeds that are exposed.They destroyed all of the snap peas I planted a couple of weeks ago.  Only one seedling survived their havoc.  The other day I discovered that the shelves from these racks fit nicely over an earthbox.  The mesh openings are small enough to keep the squirrels and birds from digging up the seeds before they germinate.  I simply laid the mesh shelf over the top of the earthbox and secured it into place.  The soil level is a couple of inches lower and the seedlings can either grow through the mesh or I can simply remove the shelf once they've established themselves.I am considering buying another unit just for the mesh shelves.  I direct seed things like cucumbers, beans, peas, radishes and squash in the earthboxes and often have to plant multiple times before I have enough growing.  These shelves should solve that problem.For hardening off seedlings, I only close the covers if we expect a cool night and my racks are used on a covered front porch and against the back of the house.  I position them so they are less susceptable to wind to help sheild the plants from cold wind and keep them from blowing over.  After a brief period, I bring the plants out of the unit for gradually increasing lengths of time so they get a little wind and the stems get sturdy.  You do need to shift the plants because they will always grow toward the light and they need fresh air and wind to become strong enough to survive in the garden.Those who have had trouble with plants wilting due to too much moisture need to give the plants more access to fresh air and air circulation.  Just remove the cover when the temps allow it or remove the trays of plants for a few hours a day.",1348531200,2012-09-25

On the other hand, maybe this oval shape was well-researched to optimized smoking capabilities?

A little more information about the design rationale would be helpful.  I am going to test this box however more to see if it really does perform better than my other box and/or compare it against wrapping wood chips in aluminum foil with a few poked holes.",1271894400,2010-04-22

It's two all-brass pieces, one screwed into the other, with two small O-ring gaskets inside (that look like they're easily repaired).It sprays anything from a fine mist to a forceful stream, so it's good for anything from filling containers to watering new (and delicate) grass and plants.The only downside to an all-brass design is that the nozzle get get awfully cold if you're using it in a colder climate in early spring/late fall.

4.0,"I have a very minimal need for pressure washing, pretty much limited to doing the front stairs and sidewalk and maybe the back deck once a year or so. For that reason, I prefer the smaller, easier to handle electric type. I didn't have any complaints about myAR Blue Clean AR383 1,900 PSI 1.5 GPM 14 Amp Electric Pressure Washer with Hose Reel, but I was glad to give this Karcher with similar specs and profile a try.Really the only thing I didn't like was the amount of assembly required and the crappy instructions for putting it together. I don't know when it became fashionable for companies to give all their assembly and operation instructions with pictures only, but I'd wish they'd stop and just tell us what to do. Fortunately, assembling the pieces of this pressure washer was not that bad, as there are only a few ways things can go together in the first place. All in all assembly took only around thirty minutes and I didn't use nearly as many bad words as I've used with other products.Once it was together, this pressure washer was very easy to operate: plug it in, press the button, connect and turn on the hose and turn on the washer. You can use the adjustable sprayer for focused or low power washing, or you can use the rotating head for a powerful, clean ""sweeping"" action. Both heads worked great and having the adjustable flow was very useful when I used it to wash my car. Typical operation for cleaning the stairs and sidewalk was as expected: move back for a wider, slower spray, move in for a narrower, faster spray. Everything just worked. This one is slightly more powerful than my blue pressure washer, but just as easy to operate. A slightly longer cord and/or hose would have made it ideal, but I don't really have any complaints. This is a good product, but I'm deducting one star for the amount of assembly and the fussy, cartoonish instructions. Otherwise, this is quite a good pressure washer.",1397001600,2014-04-09

3.0,"This is a tube-shaped bird feeder for hanging in your backyard. It consists of a metal tube that measures approximately 14&#34; tall and 3&#34; in diameter. It has a total of 4 feeding holes, 2 opposite each other 4.5&#34; from the bottom, and 2 more 3&#34; below that, set off at 90 degrees from the first. There are metal perches beneath each feeding hole that extend approximately 1.75&#34; from the tube. The holes themselves are about 1.25&#34; wide by about 1.5&#34; inches high. The holes are shielded from above with metal inserts that run through the tube so that a bird can stick its head inside the tube to feed and not cause a shower of seeds to fall out on the ground. The lid to the tube is a metal cone that snaps on. There is a metal wire loop through the top for hanging the feeder onto a hook or tying it to a piece of rope; this wire extends through the tube to the top of the first feeder shield. On 2 sides of the top (parallel to the lower feeder holes) there are slots measuring approximately 5&#34;x1.5&#34; so that you can visually monitor the seed level in the feeder. Behind these slots are a tube of clear plastic so that seeds won't fall out the sides. Empty, the feeder weighs approximately 1.75 lbs. The bottom is sealed with a loose metal disk that is (sort of) clamped on with a wire clip. Perhaps it is intended that this would allow the tube to filled from the bottom, or opened for cleaning. The tube is painted forest green, and the lid, perches, and head shields are a coppery brown, making the feeder an attractive addition to a yard.While it's certainly pretty, I faced a number of challenges when using this feeder. First, it took a bit of wrangling to get the shields, perches, and bottom seal installed correctly since the feeder ships somewhat partially assembled with no instructions (either that, or it rattled apart during shipping). On my feeder, the bottom perch was loose, and I had to re-engineer it by attaching it securely with an additional piece of wire wrapped around the bottom of the feeder. Once installed in the yard, the birds took to the feeder immediately. However, I was a little nervous for them because they have to stick their heads inside the shields to get at the seed, which restricts their ability to keep an eye out for predators while they feed. Also, the perches seem to be a bit close together vertically, and some birds didn't seem comfortable having neighbors feeding so near, so there seemed to be a bit more fighting over perches than with my other tube-shaped feeder. The lid isn't that easy to manipulate one-handed, which requires you to put down your container of seeds to get the lid open, and then again to shut the lid. If you don't take the time to push the lid down securely after filling the tube, it often comes loose, causing the entire feeder to hang at an odd angle, and allowing rain or snow to get inside the tube. The plastic sleeve inside the tube that lines the wide slots is made of extremely thin plastic, and I'm not sure how that will stand up to the elements for long term use. After just one week of use in my yard, it is already showing scratches on the inside from abrasion by seed shells. The worst problem, however, is the bottom seal, which doesn't seal at all. This morning, I woke up to an empty feeder--the bottom seal had worked its way loose, falling off in the snow, and all the seed fell out on the ground. Before I re-install the feeder, I'm going to have to re-engineer it again to try to find a way to make sure the bottom seal stays put.This feeder bills itself as a &#34;bunker&#34;, designed to &#34;provide maximum durability against squirrels&#34;. Good luck with that. Yes, it's a metal feeder, and that's a durable material. A squirrel could probably use the tiny gap between the metal and plastic sleeve for grip, however, to crawl down the tube and stick its greedy little paws in the feeding holes. A bear would simply grab the entire tube, pull open the top and help itself to a nutritious snack. If it's squirrels that you are worried about, the most effective way to protect your feeder is location, location, location--put the feeder out of reach by hanging it higher and away from buildings, trees, or other structures. In general, this feeder is attractive, but probably not entirely squirrel-proof, and it will require some fiddling, adding additional wires and/or glue to make it doesn't lose essential parts.",1394582400,2014-03-12

5.0,"There really isn't all that much that I can add to whats already been said about these new fangled traps.  Let it just be said that they are best design and have the best function available if you are in the market or favor the old fashioned original traps we all grew up with.  I've been setting mouse traps for over 40 years and have never really gotten my finger smashed.  Yet I still shudder and am nervous every time I set one.  Everything in the old traps is there and exposed and you fully have to pull back the spring action to set it.  This trap utilizes a V shaped mechanism where the trap and spring handle are split and half, and only a fraction of the strength is needed to set it and get the same deadly tension.  You simply lift the handle that is standing straight up to release the victim in the end.  Also, this trap employs a small cup for bait as opposed to the inefficient little hook thingy that for too many of us I'm afraid, has only served as a buffet for many a mouse that managed to get the meal and make a successful escape. The little cup necessitates the mouse digging at the meal with the tension platform totally surrounding it.  I have never seen yet a mouse escape with the meal with this thing in charge.  This is it folks, the proverbial better mouse trap.  It's cheap, always available here on Amazon, (they are also carried but often are sold out at my local Lowe's) and most of all they do the job they are intended for just great.

My yard is also on a slight slop and I have a lot of sand and clay, which doesn't help.It helps for the soil to be damp when you set the trap.

3.0,"We have a lot of small birds around our home, but up until receiving theBirdscapes 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feederthe only ones I was feeding were the hummingbirds.  Before I received the feeder I was already scouting our yard for a good place to hang it.  Originally I had hoped to put it outside of a window that our cat likes to sit in, but I was vetoed on that idea. So eventually I decided to use a tree in our front yard, so that there would be no additional hardware to buy and install.Filling and attaching the feeders was relatively easy. Just make sure when you screw back on the bases which will act as the perch, that you put them on the right feeders. The seed feeder has much larger openings than the water feeder and if you mix them up, the water will flow out within seconds. Yes I did this in the rush to put them outside and I figure it's good info for others.Once I found a branch secure enough to hold the feeders it was simple to hang the hook and attach the feeders one at a time. Currently the water feeder hangs down a bit further on mine, but that can change depending on how quickly they each empty out. It took a couple days to see any activity, but I have been seeing some small finch-like birds hanging out at the seed feeder.Now if the my review were only on the ability to attract birds and for the way it looks, it would get 5 stars. Unfortunately the quality and price play a factor, so I had to remove 2 stars. I really question the durability and how well this feeder will hold up over the next year. Beyond the decorative hook, it's made entirely out of plastic which was a surprise when you look at it's cost of over $30 at this time.

4.0,"This feeder is quite large, and holds up to 12 lbs. of bird seed. It may be more feeder than you need, unless you have a huge number of birds visiting your yard. The size can make it hard to find a good place to hang it, unless you have a shepherd's crook. It also comes with the hardware required to attach it to a post rather than hanging it.I've hung mine very low on my rhododendron bush so my ground-feeding birds will feel comfortable using it. Even with it so close to the ground, there seems to be no pilferage from squirrels or other furry creatures. Just don't hang it so low that the squirrels can eat from it without stepping on the bar. Their weight on the bar is what causes the feeding ports to be blocked.The feeder is quite sturdy, made of metal except the windows, which are plastic.

All in all, a satisfactory purchase.",1277856000,2010-06-30
5.0,"For all of you who don't want to read all of my discoveries and learning experiences, here's my CONCLUSIONS FIRST:1.  Mower arrived in good shape except shipping damage that was easy to fix.2.  I am old, so the 45 minute charge duration doesn't bother me, it might not work well for you guys that mow all afternoon.3.  There are many quirks and the learning curve might be tedious for some of you, but if you read below, you'll get most of them up front.  The primary difficulty most people have is turning the unit 180 degrees and the problem with it not backing up because the wheels lock.  If you approach your spin-around point and let go of the drive lever, spin it around on the back wheels and apply the drive again before you even set it down, you'll hardly miss a beat.  For the lock-up problem, you just have to know to let go of the drive lever before you stop.  If you run into a tree or something, you're not going to be able to back it out without skidding the drive wheels.4.  There is a plastic insert between the blade and the drive shaft of the motor.  The insert also serves as a fan for the motor.  If you hit something hard with the blade, the insert is made so that the blade pops off of the teeth of the insert and onto a round portion so you don't cause damage to the blade.  If that happens you need to take the blade nut off and straighten the blade back onto the teeth... 5 minutes including the time to find the 3/4 inch wrench.My final thoughts as of today:  Great mower for my needs, much power to pull it up hills, enough weight to let it coast going down hills.  Battery lasts longer than I do.  How long until the battery needs replacing?  I don't know but if you always have it hooked to the charger, as instructed, I suspect it will last several years.ORIGINAL REVIEW AND UPDATES:I'm a regular reviewer on Amazon and the purchase of this item was a big deal for me.  I spent over a week reading the other reviews before ordering and then re-read them to prepare myself for the different shortcomings.  I want to start a biography for this mower so anyone who can stand my wordiness can see my entire experience with it.First of all, I'm 72.  I started mowing lawns for extra money back when I was about 10 and my dad bought an electric mower.  I figured I didn't even have to buy gas, so this was a great way to earn some cash.  My 8yo brother and I went door to door every evening after school looking for a yard to cut, we charged a buck, so it was pretty easy to get customers most of the time.  He would manage the wire to keep it out of my way, and I just pushed.I live now in a family property of 8 acres, with about half of that mow-able. There are many many trees and places that the nice riding mower can't get to, so we need still to have a small mower to finish things off.  I've been using a corded electric, but there are places my 3 extension cords can't reach, and it's a pain getting around all of the trees.  SO a self propelled mower is logical, and I like the idea of not having to buy gas and store it (I even have reviews on here about gas cans!) so this particular mower is very attractive to me, thus the extensive study of the reviews.  Note that the riding mower is stored in a special shed away from any houses.I will put my experiences with it as they happen and will update many times as I learn tricks and experience problems:6/19/2012  Initial Impression:UPS delivered this item from Kentucky to South Texas in 3 days.  The box was battered, but the only damage to the mower was a slightly bent handle mount on the top of the mower.  I just attached the handle to that first, and used the leverage of the handle to push it back into position, then bolted the other side of the handle in place.  Then I rolled the mower to where it will live in the carport and plugged in the charger.  It took less than two hours for the green light to come on...maybe less, that was the first time I'd checked it.First chuckle:  One of the reviewers complained that it took two men and a lot of muscle to set the height.  Without reading the instructions, I looked on the side of the mower and there's the adjustment squeeze  button.  It's big.  Squeeze it and the mower comes up by itself... push down on the mower and it lowers.  10 seconds, and NO effort.  Kind of obvious, guys... maybe yours was broken or something.Took a few seconds to figure out the starting sequence, but since I use an electric mower anyway, not that different.  Just push a big red button on the side, pull in the wide ""dead man's control"" on the handle and there ya go... Oh yeah of course the interlock key has to be plugged in...that's so kids can't start it.  My only complaint about this setup is that the button is on the side in a rather wide space on the handle, so it's not easy to see and not easy to feel either.  I'll get used to where it is and soon won't even have to think about pushing it.Turned off the blade and engaged the drive lever.  It's a big orange lever that goes across the handle, shaped so that as you're moving you can tap it on and off to fine tune your speed as needed for your detail work.  People complain that it's too fast in the slowest setting, but folks, you don't drive your car with the pedal to the metal, just tap this as you need to go, let go as you want to not go so fast.. It's a clutched electric drive, so it hurts nothing to control your speed this way.  If you're wanting to drive the mower from one location to another, yeah hold it down and let it get up to the speed you want to walk or even run.  I never took it out of slowest though... yeah I'm 72.Turning around seemed to be a problem for many reviewers, complaining that the wheels locked.  I just let off the drive lever, raised the front wheels, spun it around, engaged the lever again (a little earlier than the front wheels set down) and I'm going the other way lickity split.  Absolutely no problem and short learning curve.My front yard is on a slant, going down to a cliff that overlooks the river.  We've had problems with people falling off the cliff and once my brother in law actually rode the riding mower off and hurt himself badly, so I was a little worried about controls down in that area.  Tapping the drive lever worked fine though... when you tap it ON, it accelerates gradually and when you let go, it just lets you push or it slows down due to it's weight... doesn't take long to get used to.That's pretty much my first impression and first installment here... there will be much more.  Oh and this mower is spiffy visually... kind of like a sports bike of lawn mowers.  I like it just fine on day one.Day two 6/20/12:I don't know how many words Amazon allows for reviews, but I can see this will become a blog.  Sorry to you guys that like it all said in 20 words or less, but there's 222 other reviews here.  This is for the people who want to know all the details before buying and for those who are having problems and maybe my experiences might help them.This morning I was mowing mainly under low branches of trees where the big Zero Radius Hustler can't go.  The slanted snout on the B&D; makes this a breeze except under mesquite trees... there's no easy way to avoid the thorns.  But with the constant back and forth, there's no use for the self-propulsion, so of course I just pushed and pulled.  This mower is heavier than the little electric corded mower, but much more powerful, so I really didn't have a problem.  Nice clean cuts even in very tall grass.  Some places hadn't been cut all spring, so they were very deep and yes the mower bogged... but often the thought in my head was, well that one would have killed a gas motor and I'd be pulling the cord now.  Instead I just pull it back a few inches and the speed comes right back up.  Of course when you stall an electric motor like that, it's like putting a direct short on the battery, so try not to do that... easy to raise the front wheels and just take it a layer at a time.About wheel lock:  Apparently the drive to the rear wheels is a ratchet setup and if you let off the drive bar, the ratchet stays in it's slot and the mower will not back up.  Just nudge the mower forward and the ratchet releases and you can back up, it's not a big deal at all and I don't see why none of the people reporting this problem realize it just takes a bump forward to release it.  Easier though for me if I'm going back and forth a lot, like up next to a bush or a wall, to just power it myself.Today I did run the battery down pretty bad, but I was ready to quit by then anyway.  It still limped home on it's own power.6/21/2012:  Heavy Stuff!Today I mowed along a fence line that hasn't been mowed all year.  Weeds here are 3' tall and more. So tall that rolling over them just knocks them down without much cutting.  This would be true of any mower doing this job.  I Cut these by going forward and pulling back, so that it hooks the fallen weeds and chops them from the top.  This really should have been done by the Hustler or by a tractor even, but I just did it to test the mower.  I tried several ways to do it but the 2 feet forward and 2 feet back seemed to work the best.  Second best was taking just a small sliver each run and then going back over the whole thing a second time, but this left a lot of stalks standing.  Ended up next to the fence and it was interesting to note how these wheels let you snug right up against an object forward and backward.  All in all it did a nice job but it's heavy.  But I think the weight helps in deep stuff like this.Battery still had enough power afterward to climb the hill faster than I could walk on the way home.7/15/2012  Hot, but restfulNot sorry to say that since we are in Texas, this is the dry season and the grass doesn't grow much without rain.  I haven't had to mow since my last post, but we've had a few sprinkles in the last week, so I'm sure I will be making another entry soon.  The mower is connected to the charger, waiting for it's chance to show off.9/30/12 No problems, a couple of new ideasOk we've had a couple of good slow soakers here and though the river is still pretty low, the grass is growing happily.  I mowed a little last week just to level out the front yard (river side of the house) and no problems to report.Today I worked about an hour on my brother's lawn next door to me, they've been gone to Seattle all summer.  Grass and weeds pretty lush, knee height.  No problems other than avoiding stepping in fire ant mounds.  Then on to the slope by the river, which is the main reason I bought a self propelled mower.  Works wonderfully and I'm getting very good at manipulating the power drive.  Noted that sometimes I'm busy with both hands and I can nudge the drive bar with my stomach to get going... don't know how much of a discovery that is.  Another small item is that the LED on the charger is only visible from straight on, so I have always had to walk right up to it and look down to see if it's green or red or off (bad a.c. socket at the house).  So I turned the charger on the side and faced it toward the entry to the carport so I can see it from a distance... intuitive I guess.Still very happy I bought this mower.  Perfect for my uses.4/13/13 Spring MowingSo nice to walk out after months of non-use and push a button and off I go.  I did leave the charger plugged in all winter as instructed.  No issues whatsoever and I'm mowing for about half an hour each day both for cleanup of the lawn and for exercise.  I'm now very good at maneuvering the thing and have no problems with it.  I'm still a happy customer.  No gas to change out, no additives to keep the gasoline from gelling, no oil to check... just disconnect the charger, put in the key and go... never a hesitation from the mower.",1340064000,2012-06-19

5.0,"After years of using various outdoor covers for furniture, grills and ATVs, I was shocked when I saw the quality of these covers. I was expecting the typical reinforced vinyl material that usually lasts two seasons max.  These Classic Accessories covers are constructed of a double stitched, woven polyester material like travel and duffle bags are made of plus they have a waterproof backing.  My first comment was, ""These are too nice to leave outside on the deck all winter.""Climate extremes are drastic from the scorching desert Southwest to the mildewing tropics of the Southeast which might be more harsh on the fabric than the winters in the upper Midwest.  Some regions might get longer service life than others thus 3-stars in one region and 5-stars in another.Some reviewers say their glass is half empty while others say it is half full.I've rated many items 1-Star.  When I do, I explain why in detail and how I believe it could be made better.  Quite often, I offer, IMHO, a better alternative.For the most part, the 4-Year Replacement Warranty on the Ravenna line speaks for itself.  Unless a family of raccoons finds a new home, I suspect they will last that long or longer.In addition to durability, quality amenities like easy to use buckles and tie-down straps provide a finished, tailored and stylish appearance.If you have quality outdoor furniture with no place to store it during the winter months, here's your answer.Here we go.There are more durable options that will last longer. I have several Military Specification, industrial grade, 22 oz. treated canvas tarps that have lasted over a dozen years.  They are bulky and hard to fold. For 4 months out of the year, the general appearance is that an army of Hobbits have set up an encampment on my deck while the NSA satellite monitors believe that I'm hiding something lethal.Well, I guess a couple of large BBQ grills could be deadly, especially the way I cook.The problem with this option is that whatever you have covered in these tarps will smell like an Army tent for a month after the covers are removed.",1376092800,2013-08-10

5.0,"Though I grew up on a farm, somehow I did not inherit the green thumb. Since our family eats so many veggies everyday, I wanted to grow my own.

You simply pop it in the dirt (you don't even need to cover them with more dirt), water and wait for them to sprout.They are all sprouting what appears to be healthy plants. It is way too early to harvest them, but I feel confident I will get great results.This package comes with a nice variety of veggies and herbs (a few are duplicates). There are pods for dill, cilantro, basil, lettuce, beans, tomato and cucumber.It also comes with clear directions for spacing and sunlight and plant food.

This charger is light and folds up flat.  It comes with four rechargeable AA batteries. AAA batteries will also fit in the charger.The panel size when spread out in the sun has more surface area for the money than similar priced chargers.

3.0,"May 20, 2014 UpdateI see my review of this product has received no positive and one negative opinions so far. It is my experience that people tend to like positive reviews more than negative reviews. But I count on consumer comments here on Amazon and I want to know what's good and perhaps not so good when I buy an item. Not being shy I'll add to my review with a little more detail.We have now used this hose reel daily for over a month. In general this is a decent hose reel but I have one issue with it. It is a little hard to crank.If you are a young strong person this will not be an issue for you. I am 67 years old and I feel as if I'm working out at the gym when I roll the hose up with this Liberty Garden 710. I believe this is due to two design characteristics.1) The reel itself has a little tension. There is a tension adjust screw which I have backed out all the way, and even have tried removing the tension adjust screw altogether. Perhaps other copies of this reel don't have as much tension. It isn't really tight. It's just enough not to be free wheeling.2) The length of the handle bar, which connects the handle to the center of the hose reel, is a bit short which provides less leverage than would be comfortable for my wife and I. The handle doesn't even extend to the outer edge of the reel. There is plenty of room for a longer handle if Liberty wants to make a design change.As a comparison we have a different hose reel in our front yard. That reel (mentioned below) has zero tension on it with the lock off. Also the handle is mounted on the outer edge of the reel (and that unit has a larger reel diameter) so there is quite a bit more leverage. We find that unit easy to use.So if you don't mind the effort required to use this Liberty Garden 710 then you should be pleased with it. However if you're like my wife and I you may find this just a bit too much effort to use on a daily basis. We have 75' of 5/8"" hose on this reel. We pull it out daily to water flowers in our typical 100+ degree low humidity weather. When we roll the hose up we aren't rolling up with the whole 75' being pulled by the reel. We normally only pull out about 50 feet of hose, then, when we're done watering, we double back to the reel with the hose end in our hand. So we are only pulling 25 feet of hose at most.March 22 updateI did install the reel today. I am concerned about it's use for three reasons.1) It is stiff to wind up the hose. That may improve with time.2) Compared to the plastic reel it replaced (that failed) it protrudes much further from the wall which puts more tension on the bracket. I'm afraid it is going to pull out from the wall. If it does it will be my fault for not using more substantial hardware to install it I guess.3) As I said earlier it has no lock to hold the hose in place when it is reeled in. Perhaps the design makes the hose stiff to reel in so it won't turn too freely, presumably then not requiring a lock.It is my wife, the gardener, who will have the final say. I will leave this review at 4 stars so far as these are just my concerns. Actual use may be better than my first impressions.We have an Eley / Rapid Reel Wall Mount Garden Hose Reel Model 1041 in the front yard which we are very pleased with. If this Liberty doesn't work out we will buy a second Eley.Eley / Rapid Reel Wall Mount Garden Hose Reel Model 1041ORIGINAL REVIEW...We've had a cheap plastic hose reel in our back yard for about a year. It has worked well but sometimes the whole reel pops off, due to a faulty latch design, and sprays water everywhere. When Amazon offered this Liberty 710 free as part of the Amazon Vine program I snatched it up as a replacement for our cheap plastic reel.Upon opening the box I was pleased by two things about the Liberty 710.1) The entire hose reel consists of two main parts, a handle to be installed, Two screws and nuts, and a leader hose. I really appreciate the design which resulted in very view parts to deal with. The shelf part is installed on a wall without having the weight of the hose reel itself attached. Then attaching the reel is accomplished by simply sliding it into slots on the shelf, then using two screws to hold it in place. The instructions, clear with ample drawings, are easy to understand and follow.2) The materials and construction are of good quality. I wasn't expecting the smoothness of the power coat finish. The steel material seems to be heavy enough last a long time, while not being so heavy as to be difficult to handle. The included leader hose seems to be sturdy with brass fittings.One major concern is there is no lock to keep the reel from turning when the hose is stored. Ideally one would approach the reel, unlock the reel, and pull the hose out for use. Then when finished one would turn the handle to roll up the hose, followed by locking the reel. There is no such lock on the Liberty 710. There is a tension screw but that means if you apply sufficient tension to keep the reel from spinning then it would also be resistant to pulling the hose off the reel for use.Another concern is rust if and when the powder coat is scrapped to the metal level. A substantial aluminum design would be my preference. At least a power coat is superior to a spray paint coating.",1393718400,2014-03-02
4.0,"This is a decent tool to determine if there is a moth problem in your clothes closets. It traps the male adult moths but, as clearly noted in the product description and on the box, the male adult moths are not the ones that chew through your clothes - that's done by the larvae. So this won't solve a moth infestation problem, but rather will let you know if you have one.If you can see moths flitting about in your closet, or have noticed chewed wool items, this is not worth getting - you already know you have moths! This is for alerting you to a problem before it becomes severe, so you can take action to get rid of the larvae before they do too much damage. Methods to get rid of the larvae include washing, freezing the clothes for a week, steam cleaning, and/or chemicals.If you're looking for an alert to a potential problem, this is a decent product to have.

5.0,"Purchased WEBER E-670 (see my praising review).  Two of these lights in gray came with the grill.  They work wonderfully.  They attach to the handle with ease.I liked those two little lights so much I wanted a third.  So I ordered this light.  Now I had two gray lights and one black light.  I didn't like the look so I ordered two more black lights.Again, necessary brackes (A) or (B) are supplied to attach to your grill.  Weather sealed plugs nest the batteries.  The lights are well built and stay put.  Easily wiped clean after grilling.  They take the heat well.  No issues what so ever.  They provide suable light to the grilling surface for those after hours cooking marathons.  They are not whimiscal but practical, well engineered, and solidly constructed.  Nice job Weber!One word of caution. I have seen these lights with a more yellowish light color (3000K) and the bright white (5000K) tone.  I was partial to the brighter white light.  I believe the difference may have due to different production dates.Purchase again?  YES",1372377600,2013-06-28
4.0,"While I am an avid vegetable/herb/flower gardener, I don't do many potted plants (too much work in the hot deep south to keep them watered!).I do, however, buy one hibiscus every year for my deck.  I used the Miracle-Gro Garden Soil for this year's hibiscus.  I didn't have any gnat/maggot/bug problems others have mentioned.  Nor did I have a lot of rocks/bark/sticks.  It's always weird when you read reviews for a product that are nothing like what you've experienced.So, the hibiscus is alive and well and putting out leaves and flowers just as it should.  The soil holds water very well without being waterlogged.I'm happy with it for using in potted plants.  I will note, however, that I would never use this in my garden beds, especially for vegetables, herbs or flowers that I was going to consume as I only use organic materials from local, reputable sources or my own compost or worm castings for that purpose.",1397692800,2014-04-17

4.0,"UPDATE 6/22/14:  I have gotten so many compliments on this set.  Everyone that sees it loves it.  Also the chair cushions are the most comfortable, especially for long time sitting.  One thing, which is why the 4 stars remain.  There are no ties on the back cushions and there really should be.  The bottom cushions have them, why not the back cushions??  I have to go out and pick up the cushions constantly as they blow around the back yard at the mildest wind.  It is windy here in So. AZ and I have had to sew on ties myself.  This would have made the set perfect if they came with the ties already on.  Still love it, however.It took about an hour to unpack and assemble.  It came in three large boxes, shrink wrapped and on a pallet.  The longest part was the unpacking.  It was well protected, with lots of heavy paper wrapped around every part of the chairs.  The chairs, themselves, come in two pieces and have four bolts to put in which is very easy if you have a helper but not impossible for one person to do.  The fire pit itself came completely assembled.  However, to get it through the house to the back yard I did have to take the top off.  That was easy since it had only four screws holding that on.Everything is well made and the chairs are very comfortable.  The seat bottom is made in a way so that it is not supposed to sag over time.  The reason for the 4 stars is the color of the upholstery.  It tends to be on the yellowish side of brown and everything in my yard leans toward reddish brown. The product picture even has a slight reddish tone to it.  Wish there was a choice of upholstery colors.  But I must say I am very pleased with the quality.This set will be outside 24/7 in Southern Arizona so the cloth and the metal finish will really get a tough test.  I would like to download my pictures but did not see anyway to do it for this product.",1400889600,2014-05-24

5.0,"Maybe it's too early to write a review on something I have used only twice...But so far this thermometer works great for me, and as mentioned before it takes a lot of the guessing work out and constantly going out to check temperature or coals. It took me a long time at first to adjust air flow and chimney settings because I kept going out to re adjust smoke flow, closing and opening vents... but after a while I caught on, and was able to relax and smoke a slow cook chicken and rib tips on a offset smoker... shows the correct temp, and I like setting the alarms for temps too high or low... all these years I never knew of a device that could make a barbeque so much easier and enjoyable...

They are as easy to use as a clothespin - you open and put the peanut butter on the yellow tab, then clip it open as you set it down.

4.0,"I have 4 hot tubs at my b&b; and I've always used the products that are recommended by the manufacturers (Nordic or Solara or my big commercial unit which uses bromine or chlorine). Generally, I just change the water out a lot, preferring to have clean water over highly chemically water. When I saw this product I was thrilled. I put the recommended amount into one of our 2 person tubs, which had some slight oiling on the surface from lotion or body oil. When I came back to check it an hour later there was a disgusting yellowish cottage cheese substance all over the surface. I don't know if this is what happens when the enzymes meet a certain type or amount of organic material, but I do know that it was a giant MESS. I ended up cleaning and flushing the tub twice, changing filters 3 times, just to get the new water free of whatever substance was in there.I spoke with somebody from the company and he suggested I try a test, to see if it was the enzyme, or my icky plumbing that was to blame. Well, I did the gallon of water test, and no ""cheese"" formed. So then I put it into the tub that I initially tried the enzyme in, and it also is cheese-free. I guess what I would recommend is that you use this product when you have ample time to empty, flush, and re-fill the tub, just in case there is a bunch of gunk in your system. I will be interested to see how this product works over time. We do a pretty frequent empty and clean on the tubs, so this was really a shocking amount of build up in the system. It will be interesting to see how this product works now that the tub has been cleaned of ""cheese"" and will be on weekly maintenance with the enzyme. The company is very responsive to any questions or concerns you have about their product and seem to be very knowledgeable.",1382313600,2013-10-21
5.0,"Great cast-iron grill.  We have usually cooked on a typical Weber-type charcoal grill, and we still use that a lot.  But this little grill has become our favorite for a quick, fun family grill time.  We use a charcoal chimney to get the coals going (half of what we use in the Weber) and sometimes add food-grade wood chips to cook chicken, salmon, burgers, hot dogs, and steak. After grilling, I will remove the grate, add some wood, and we'll roast marshmallow over a small fire.  Clean up is typical for cast iron (no soap, just hot water and light scrubbing).  Just be sure to keep the entire grill (not just the grate) well-seaosned. To clean the outside, I use hot water, a soap-free scrub sponge, and then season the body of the grill while it is still warm (so that the water evaporates and the seasoning can sink in). If you like cooking with cast iron, this is a GREAT grill to get.  If you do not like cast iron, then this grill likely won't work for you.",1379980800,2013-09-24
4.0,"I live in a pretty suburban area yet we are frequented by rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, possums, and even deer.  My backyard is surrounded by a 6'6"" wooden fence so we only get the smaller animals back there where I have my vegetable garden.  However, the front yard is open to larger creatures (including the deer) that like to munch on my flowers and bushes.  My garden is protected by theHavahart Motion Detector Sprinklerand a few other deterrents but my front yard was undefended until now.When I got a chance to try the Havahart Deer Off II I hoped that it would cut down on the bigger critters eating my landscaping.  I am an animal lover so I don't want to hurt them, I just wanted them to go back to more wooded areas.  I sprayed my ground-cover, the flowers and the shrubs that could be reached by deer.  The spray was fairly stinky when it was being applied, but not overly so.  The battery power was nice but I would rather have a pump version so I could increase the pressure of the spray to suit my pace of spraying.Once applied I kept checking to see if I had new growth on previously chewed-up plants.  The result was mixed.  The taller greenery seemed have been protected but something is still eating my flowers.  We are experiencing a drought here in San Antonio and it just could be that the animals will ignore the bad taste when they are starving.  Still, it is an improvement.  I like that the mix is all natural and it seems to be reasonably priced.  I will be buying more of this in the future.",1343865600,2012-08-02
4.0,"If you've dealt much with mice, then you're familiar with the basic traps. You've got everything from the overly elaborate humane traps which often fail in my experience, to the cheap little $.50 traps which tend to smack your finger more often than the mouse. Personally, I prefer a well built classic trap where the metal bar comes down on the mouse's neck. Yes I know it sounds brutal, but with those traps the mouse is usually killed instantly...though when he isn't it's truly not a pretty sight.If you're going to be putting down mouse traps on carpeting, you almost have to try glue traps like these. I don't think I need to explain why you might not want use classic traps on carpeting. We're adults here.  I should mention that these traps aren't for all locations.  You don't bait these traps, so they only work if you put it in an area where the mouse will walk through it.While they are effective, if you're at all squeamish, then you'll want to avoid these traps. They're essentially just a folded sheet of paper with some very powerful glue on it. If the mouse is captured you're going to see it and you're going to see it struggle and make noise. In my experience you don't have to worry about the mouse escaping, but depending on your personality it may upset you more seeing it suffer that way. If you don't want to deal with that, then I'd suggest getting glue traps that are covered so you don't see the mouse struggle or just covered regular traps so the mouse dies but you don't have to look at it and there's no mess.Now its time to say goodbyeto all our company.M-I-CSee you in HellK-E-YWhy?

The traps attracted the moths with the pheremone scented square and the stickiness kept them there.

This trap is very simple to use.  You just find one of their mole tunnels in the yard and push this into the ground and set it.  The mole while running down the tunnel will set off the trap and the spikes slam down into the mole and kill it.  You then dispose of the dead mole and set it up again to get rid of more moles.

2.0,"I live in an extremely dry area, so I would think that the birds I feed would welcome water. After over a week, though, I have yet to see any evidence that they are getting a benefit from this. I recognize two parts of the problem but not the full problem.To begin with, the hook on the top of the container will not fit over many hooks or nails, so I had to use some nylon line to hang the waterer. If you buy one, there is a plastic tie that holds on the tag and instructions (if these can be called instructions), and I recommend you don't cut it off as I did. That little tie should be enough.Filling the plastic bottle with water was easy enough, and attaching the base was easy, too. But that's when I noticed the first problem. Very little water actually came out. The next day, when I went to check, the dish from which the birds are supposed to drink was bone dry. So I shook the bottle a bit and induced some water into the dish. The next day, the dish was dry again. Once again, I jiggled the bottle and managed to get a little bit of water into the dish.I've tried screwing the base on more tightly and doing so more loosely, but water simply does not seem to want to leave the bottle and settle in the dish. That's the first part of the problem.The second part is that the base seems just too small for many birds. In the time I have had this, I must have looked at it forty or fifty times. There have been birds galore on the feeder two feet to the right of the water bottle but never a bird on the water tray.I gave it two stars rather than one in deference to those who love it. Perhaps my bottle is just defective in some way. But, having disassembled it and inspected it (thinking perhaps that the plastic hadn't been cut back sufficiently where the water was supposed to come out--not the problem, I discovered), I cannot recommend this product.",1368403200,2013-05-13

3.0,"The Perky Pet 210PB Glass Hummingbird works.  The unit has a sufficinetly large opening, so it can be filled relatively easily.If you need a larger feeder like this, it may be a good choice.  However, be mindful of the fact that the sugar water must be changed every five (5) days or so.  Accordingly, you may find that sixteen (16) ounces of fluid is more than you need and you may end up pouring most of it out at the end of the week.  An eight (8) ounce unit may be a better choice.This model lacks an included hook for hanging.The bottle of this model is not open at each end, it is more difficult to clean than a model with a larger opening at the top.  Perky Pet makes at least one other model which opens on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end. That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.I have four different models, but far prefer the Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder which has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.

4.0,"This unit is exactly what it looks like. It is a plastic water jug with a built in handle. Instead of the original cap, a plastic ""lid"" with narrow slits and a ring of plastic around it screws onto the top of the water jug. A quick flip upside down and gravity causes the water from the jug to fill the shallow reservoir. When the water level reaches the slits, water stops coming out until the level is lowered from evaporation or birds drinking.Pros:  Very eash to fill, the threads on the cap portion easily screw onto the jug. It's a good size.Cons:  The loop on the top is a little bit shallow, meaning it's hard to find a means of hanging that feels strong enough but is small enough to pass through the loop. Not a big problem.It isn't very attractive. It doesn't look very pretty hanging from a tree. This won't matter to the birds, but it might to a homeowner.All in all it will work well for providing the birds fresh water without a birdbath which has to be frequently cleaned due to leaves and other debris. Depending on your climate, it will probably need to be emptied and brought inside for the winter. I don't think the plastic would survive a freeze. It will be important to provide the birds who've become accustomed to having water in a particular location an alternate source of water in the winter.",1368316800,2013-05-12

3.0,"I was excited to get a new hedge trimmer to try out. First off this is gas powered, and you have to mix a little of the oil that comes with it into your gas to make it work. My husband is you still on more so he figured that out quickly. Unfortunately you have to go to step to push this button in this many times in this that and the other and then pulling the cord just like a manual lawn mower, which takes a lot of strength.  Unfortunately for me with not much upper body strength, I could not do it, my husband had to do it for me.

Revs up and is very powerful and cuts big weeds.  Oil is included.  Dual line (2 separate lines) for more cutting faster.  Bump end to make it feed down more line.Cons:have to mix oil and gas.  GAS IS FLAMABLE AND DANGEROUS, SO you can not store machine with the gas and oil in it. For storing you have to drain the tank.Complicated to start between pressing buttons and putting and levers in certain positions and then trying to pull the cord like a lawn mower cord several times to get it to go.Unfortunately the throttle button is located on the shaft of the trimmer and it vibrates every movement of the engine .

5.0,"This product works very well! Now it's designed to use one piece of newspaper and while that works... I don't get the morning paper so I don't have a stack readily available. So, what I do is I generally use the side burner on my propane grill to start the chimney and it takes only about 60 seconds to be lit.I realize using a propane grill to start your charcoal is odd, but I'm using the charcoal for my Smokey Mountain Cooker Smoker, not for actually charcoal grilling. I use propane for my grilling and charcoal for my smoking so for me it works perfectly and if you have a similar setup this will work well for you.I have also used it twice using junk mail :) and it worked using that. But my preferred method is putting charcoal in the chimney, putting it on the side propane burner for about a minute and pulling it off, works perfectly!The design of this unit is why it works so well, with a spiral spring giving the charcoal a pyramid shape in the bottom allows it to start faster. Weber removed the wood handle and put on a heat resistant plastic so that it can withstand the elements and you can tell when picking this thing up it's built to last. I highly recommend getting one of these if you need a chimney charcoal starter.

4.0,"I've used this product and products like this (liquid fence) before with varied results.Basically it's incredibly strong smelling stuff (and believe me you will smell this when mixing from concentrate and also when applying).  If you're spraying it, you probably want it to be on a relatively calm day, and have everyone go inside for a bit.  It's not so bad, but it is pretty smell stuff, and just not nice to smell.  The good news is that smell is also what is supposed to keep the deer and other critters away.I've found that this sometimes works, and I think it really depends on if your garden/shrubs/etc are the only choice for a meal or not.  If there are other options I think they just usually move on.  The product claims 90 days, but I've never had luck for that long, especially when it rains, which seem to reduce the effectiveness greatly.This specific product is great because it makes 2 gallons of the stuff, and to buy that directly would be a pain to store and quite a bit more expensive.

3.0,"This unit performs relatively well. Construction is solid, with a well-painted metal stake, brass connections, and the ability to daisy chain these sprinklers . The battery pack uses four AA batteries, I have had good luck with rechargeable NiMh cells.The night/day/anytime spray settings are a nice touch, i.e. you can set this unit up to only go after skunks and bunnies and ignore the postman by virtue of the postman not showing up when it's dark. I currently have a skunk upending my yard even in the early morning so the unit has to be set to 'always' for now.The rotating head can be set to stay inside a sector (i.e. swing back and forth) or just spin around in one direction. I've elected to use the latter setting since the sprayer can get 'stuck', i.e. not reverse direction, as intended.I'm not delighted by the limited range of the sensor for smaller, slow-moving pests like skunks that don't move quickly. The sensor (even on the most sensitive setting) has a very hard time detecting them. Other pests like squirrels that are more jumpy set it off more reliably. Large animals like deer, etc. should set it off as reliably as humans do (to the great delight of our kids playing with it).Despite the 'solid' construction, ours failed after just one year of use - the valve no longer closes, even with fresh batteries. The thing was never outside in cold conditions, the batteries are fresh, so I'm at a loss what would cause the vale to fail open.",1399507200,2014-05-08

4.0,"I have an odd birdbath arrangement on my deck that allowed me to test this unit's effectiveness. There is no question the birds prefer it, and though I still find mosquito larvae, there are fewer.  I have two identical birdbaths next to each other and found that when I added the Water Wiggler to one, the birds went to it exclusively over the other.  It was so obvious they liked it, I bought a second for the other bath.Last year I replaced two end tables and temporarily stored the old ones next to one another on my deck covered with a tarp.  I had removed the glass that had been set in the tops when I stored the tables and then a heavy rain created pools in the rectangular depressions.  I noticed that the birds found this arrangement just right for bathing as the depressions are shallow and the space is good sized.  Since I enjoyed watching the birds drinking and bathing, I decided to leave the tables there, but the standing water caused mosquito issues so I purchased a Water Wiggler to deter that and set it in one of the depressions.  Almost immediately, the birds gravitated to that space leaving the other unused.  Now both pools have Water Wigglers.  I still check them for larvae and algae and have to replace the water regularly, but that's easy and the birds are happy.  While I have a well-attended normal birdbath in my backyard, some birds won't go to it.  The thrushes and warblers apparently aren't comfortable there, but do come to the deck baths with the moving water.I found one set of batteries kept each unit working all last summer and fall.  I replaced the batteries this spring and they are going strong.  They seem to be quite sturdy as visiting night creatures sometimes knock them over or even out of the baths, but I put them back in each time and they show no signs of complaint.",1246233600,2009-06-29

5.0,"It just arrived - and my first impression is I love it. Now that may change over time but for openers it gets 5 stars.This cover replaces the 2 year old Weber cover on Genesis E330 gas grill - the material is very supple and easy to handle while putting on and removing the cover. The fit is much more relaxed than the Weber making using it a snap. The Weber was very form fitting and in 2 years it became somewhat brittle and was very difficult getting it on and off.The two anchoring systems are a nice plus as well as the handles and vents.May 8th. Up-Date:I found a new feature that I like about this cover: the handles that you use to lift it off the grill also double as a convenient way to hang it up while grilling. I just slip the handles over a fence post - there is not need to fold or have lay on the ground. When it is time to put it back on the grill I jus lift it off the post and it properly oriented to put back on, no fumbling to find the font.My LIKE level is growing.",1367193600,2013-04-29
4.0,"Used to see so many of these type replacement trimmer units sold on TV and always figured they were junk.Now they all seem to be gone from the marketplace except for two types that I found, I bought this one because it uses plain heavy duty .095 trimmer line and not special made blades that might be hard to find at some point.This can be set up to use 2 or 4 sections of line (bent double to be 4 or 8) I've been using it with only 2(4) so far and it works at least as well as my old stock unit that kept needing repairs and wasting line.Cutting pretty well, but makes the engine seem to run a bit slower and I feel the need to give it more throttle.I might try it with all 4 lines at some point to see if there is an improvement in cut, but happy as is and saves line too. (8 lines in use after you fold them over and insert) not sure what all 4(8) lines will do to the RPM range however, might not let my engine come up to full speed.This same item is also sold under the ""Rino-Tuff"" brand, but made by the same company.Check the pre cut replacement string package, for just a dollar or so more you can get 100ft of .095 line and cut 100 pcs pretty quick.Was quick and easy to install and has given no trouble so far with a few hours of cutting with it. (still the same line that came with the unit)They claim 20x the life for the line, but who knows.. even if it gets the same life per foot as the old coil loaded in, it's still easier to deal with no mechanical parts and uses low cost rolls of line.On the subject of line life, one thing to keep in mind is that when you do wear line it is not replaced by more from a spool so just gets shorter and shorter.. how long will you keep using it at it's shortest length before you put in new line?  A variable that will cause owners to report different findings on line wear times I'm sure.Claims to fit 99% of the gas trimmers out there, but no way one person can know if this is true.  Does come with a good assorment of sizes for nuts and bolts to fit what you have though.No way to know how this will hold up, but time will tell and I'll be back to say if it didn't do well 8-)NOTE;  Be sure to read the comments attached to this review before you buy",1251417600,2009-08-28

3.0,"My package arrived intact and was easy to assemble:  insert hose into the container, screw cap back on, and unlock the sprayer.  When done properly no liquid and its smell gets on your hands.  This is good for those who don't want to deal with any overspill, smell or residue.It took a while for the liquid to come through the nozzle but it did spray out evenly over the surface I was using this on:  a sun-drenched dirt area of my garden popular with cats in my hood.The spray does seem to keep the cats away.  I haven't seen new poop in a while.Two complaints, though.  This stuff is expensive and it doesn't last as long as advertised.  The battery-powered sprayer seems more like a gimmick to me.  I'd prefer hand-pump action instead.I live in the high desert where dry, warm weather persists long into the year.  We don't get deer down here (they stay higher in the foothills) but we do get our share of stray dogs and cats roaming through at night.

4.0,"Background: we've had a minor mouse situation in the attic for a few years.  We are not cat people, so have been using glue traps, with intermittent yet consistent success.  But be warned, traveler,the glue trapis a tool for the hardy and steely of nerve: open, right there, for all to see, and picking one up with a still-alive mouse in it, those beady yet pathetic little eyes looking at you as it squeaks helplessly in abject horror, its tiny little muscles squirming like mad to flee, futilely, under its increasingly loose skin...most unpleasant.  Or even picking one up with a long-dead mouse permanently stuck to it, half-skeletal, the dead maggots that consumed it also stuck on the glue.Well, that's all pretty nasty, obviously, so the better mousetrap people have come up with this thingy.  The packaging calls this a ""hygienic mousetrap.""  Well, that's accurate enough.  This mousetrap is the equivalent of a hospital sharps container; all the bad stuff goes inside, nothing comes out, and then you just toss the whole thing into the trash.  You pick up the entire, one-time-use container, and all of the sad, unpleasant, ugly, nasty mouse-gunk goes into the garbage.  (I note that this device is not recyclable, the only recyclable item being the box it comes in.  But then again, that's not the point here, right?)The packaging stresses that this trap's unique design traps blood, feces, urine, bugs (fleas and ticks--disease vectors!) neatly inside.  It goes on to imply that this trap will eliminate the threat of salmonella and the triggering of asthma attacks, too.  The copy also indirectly threatens that fleas and ticks from dead mice in a conventional trap could jump to ""kids and pets.""  This is nothing but copywriting hyperbole.  Fleas may be able to jump, but a tick isn't going to beat a glue trap.  A traditional spring trap will offer up blood, feces and urine, and then some, and that's plenty funky when you go to empty the trap, especially if you plan to use the thing again, but none of that goop escapes a glue trap.You get two of these traps in each package, which comes out to well over four dollars each.  That's really pretty spendy for a mousetrap.  Compare this with a rough unit price of about a dollar and a half each for an effective glue trap.  That's a 311% difference.  So, is that extra three-odd dollars' worth not having to touch or even see or smell the unfortunate effects of killing household vermin?  You decide, ya mouse-killer.There is a cute little screw-off cap into which you drop your choice of delicious mouse bait (we used peanut butter).  The cap well even has a neato little black rubber gasket, for a better seal, I guess.  You screw it on, set the trap with a single large external lever, and then set it down.  Of the two traps I received, one set immediately and stayed set, and the other was totally unreliable.  It was extremely sensitive to the slightest touch, and would snap prematurely.  I have checked it numerous times since I set and placed it, and each time it had snapped, with no mouse inside.  So, half of them didn't work properly at the outset.Results: I've waited a number of months to write this, hoping for a capture with this trap, and some comparative results from the 5 glue traps we have in place.  In that time, our glue traps have caught one mouse, and these two traps (with one usually out of commission because it keeps snapping on its own) have caught one. The other one has remained open and unsprung.  In the successful trap there was no leakage from the trap, and close-in examination revealed no smell at all; that's a pretty effective seal.Bottom line: If even the sight of a live mouse brings on a total freakout, this is the trap for you.  If a dead mouse, its smell, or any of the unavoidable physical manifestations of mousetrap death bother you, then this also is the mousetrap for you. And if your skin crawls at the thought of formerly mouse-borne ticks, fleas, mites or other biological hitchhikers abandoning that redolent rodent carcass for somewhere else in your magnificently pure home, then this is most certainly the trap for you.  Just understand that avoiding these minor unpleasantries is going to cost you, and until they invent little auto-deploying robotic mousetrap legs and an auto-garbage can homing circuit (which they will, eventually), you're still going to have to pick it up and dump it in the can yourself.",1297296000,2011-02-10

5.0,I have had numerous kits for my mowers over the years but none as well thought out as this one. Instead of just a disposable cardboard box to hold the items someone came up with the clever idea of providing a reusable container. The top half transforms into a very handy funnel and the bottom half becomes a receptacle for draining old oil. This kit contains all the items required to service the mower and made tuning up my mower an easy task. Bravo to Champion for their ingenuity and their consideration of consumer needs. In an era when most products seem to be poorly constructed and over priced it is a pleasant surprise to find such a well designed and affordable necessity.

3.0,"The good: These do lighten flower pots up a lot, relative to putting rocks in the bottom. I like them for hanging baskets, which I always seem to make too heavy. They provide good drainage at the same time they don't prevent all the water from running out the bottom of the pot.The bad: I think they are too easily compressible, and over time the weight of the soil on them will flatten them out too much. Additionally, the manufacturer assumes you will be planting annuals in them, and tells you to rinse them out at the end of the season and store them. Honestly, I am unlikely to do that, either from laziness or forgetfulness. They will probably just sit in the pot all winter. Who knows what they will be like at the end of a winter. I suppose one could always rinse them out at the beginning of the next season!The eh: I'm not sure they are worth the price. Someone else pointed out that you could just as easily put a bunch of pot scrubbers (flea market scrubbers should work just as well) in your pots and get the same effect. And a few handfuls of perlite or vermiculite in a pot will also lighten it considerably and improve drainage. They would be cheaper alternatives.So they are good in some aspects and bad in others.

This is cool because you can start them in their very small containers and transplant them safely into a bigger pot or the ground without having to do the risky part of transplanting!You'll soon want to have more things planted, but this will give you a good idea of how easy it is to grow certain things and what time of year they'll pop up.These are supposed to be started soon after the last frost of winter, so plan accordingly.",1377216000,2013-08-23
5.0,"AsI am a Vine reviewer, I am required to do a review within 30 days of receiving a product.  That does not give enough time to see how the product works, sometimes.  So, I can tell you that this product is very easy to use.  Just hook it to your waterhose and turn the water on.  There is a little lever to turn and it starts spraying.  I have had these types of sprayers that spray about 5-7 feet in front of you and it takes forever to do a whole yard.  This one sprays about 10-12 feet, so it went a lot faster.  It was windy when I sprayed (the only day I had available) and that was a problem (trying to stay down-wind) but on a still day, it would have been fine.  The instructions say that it isn't harmful to humans or pets if used properly, but I couldn't find anyplace that said what the definition of ""properly"" was.  You can use this product around fruit trees and vegetables, but you must make sure the spray doesn't land on the edible part or even the blossom.  Still, I stayed out several feet from my little fruit trees.  I noticed that it got used up pretty quickly, so if you have much ground to cover, you'll probably need more than one bottle.  I have a big backyard, but I don't spray all of it; just where I want to keep the gophers away and it used about 80-90% of the bottle.  Overall, it was easy to use and should be a good way to keep gophers out if it works properly.  But it hasn't been long enough to see if the gophers were run off or not.5-13-14  A little time has passed and I can say that the gophers have moved out of the area that I sprayed and, so far, have stayed out.  I have been pleased with the results, though most products of this type have to be re-sprayed every 2-3 months, and this one probably will, too.",1398297600,2014-04-24
5.0,This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!,1331596800,2012-03-13
5.0,"This shovel is incredible!  I recently broke my shovel digging up a shrub for relocation - the metal neck of the shovel snapped in half.  I started shopping for a new shovel and found this Fiskars beast of a tool.  I never dreamed anyone ever manufactured such a heavy duty shovel.  So far I love it.  It's great at cutting through roots or dense heavy soil.  This thing is steel from tip to tip.  Beautiful black protective finish on the steel.  Handle is not round but &#34;teardrop&#34; shape for a comfortable grip.  The wide platform step for your foot is great.  Nice thick 14 gauge steel blade begs for hard use.  Warning:  this thing is heavy and not for the faint of heart and probably not the right tool for the elderly or less vigorous user (I'm 61 myself).  I don't mind the weight of it, in fact the weight  facilitates the efficiency of the tool and helps drive the shovel into the ground and helps with prying and leverage.  It appears pricey for a home use shovel, but when you look at it, hold it, and use it, it becomes obvious that it is a great value.  Built to last.  Hooray for Fiskars!",1402012800,2014-06-06

The only problem is that it has no lasting power.  The fittings are all in plastic and hardly durable.  The hose itself can't be left out in the sun - the sun will break it down.  Then it's not even durable because even when you are super careful with it, it can still develop leaks.  The outer covering is a strange, crunchy material that fades in the sun - none of it seems up to par for durability.  I think this is useful maybe for times when you need a portable hose - this has to be the most portable hose around...but you can't rely on it, so I'm not sure if the convenience of the portability is worth not knowing if it will last for you and when it will break for no reason at all.

5.0,"When measuring the success or failure of hummingbird feeders, there really isn't a lot to go on. You have a place to add the nectar, a place where the birds sip and a way to hang it.  This feeder excels in all the areas.  First, it's compact in size (measuring just under 11 inches and not including the substantial wire hanger - and just under 7inches at the circular bird perch).  The column of thick glass holds 12oz of the bird nectar and is MUCH easier to pour in because the mouth is wider than previous models I've had.The Brushed Copper is well done but know, the bottom is plastic (what the glass tube screws into) but it's out of site and makes the feeder able to be under 2 lbs.I really like the looks of this feeder and the steel hook is ideal.

For the price the quality is phenomenal. Some reviewers have complained that the glass has begun to fade, I haven't had it long enough to say, but it does not seem like the red should come off. The glass actually looks like it is tinted red, and I have not seen any fading in a month in scorching Arizona sun I don't know if the company changed the way they manufacture them or if other reviewers washed it with hot water (dishwasher?).I love hummingbird feeders and am happy to have this elegant feeder as a backyard decorative accent.

The top is removable (but difficult to take off so kids can't pry it open) so that you can place a new poison block if/when needed.

Like other gas powered tool owners at that time, I seriously had my doubts. That changed after a few weeks use. I'm very surprised that after eight years, this mower is still up and running.Weighing in at 52 lbs, this 12 amp mower cuts a 19"" path in no time. With adjustable wheel heights ranging from 1.4"" to about 3.5"", it does a nice job. I like the one touch feature for wheel height adjustment. There's no fuss and tightness to contend with. I don't miss the noise of a gas powered motor. Unlike the newer version, my mower has a straight handle bar with a comfortable grip. The start handle is conveniently located on the right side and has a good feel to it. Other then that, there's really not that much of a change from the original.This mower is light and easy to maneuver around bushes and trees.  It does an average job of mulching. Mine came with the side discharge chute. The rear bag that now comes with the newer units was an optional purchase back in 2003. Even though I don't use it much, the folding handle is a nice add on for owners with tight spaces. As far as power cords go, I picked up a good 100 foot length 14/3 gauge outdoor extension cord. Its not that hard to manage the extension cord. When using any power tool, its all about staying alert.Like any piece of gear, proper maintenance is paramount. Prior to using this or any mower, its a good idea to coat the undercarriage with a non stick spray. I use the generic grilling spray on mine. I give the blades a good coating too. Since the body isn't metal, I use a rubber spatula to remove any buildup. Afterwards, a good wipe down. Its a good idea to inspect the bolts, nuts and screws for tightness after each use. Just like gas powered mowers, it does take a little bit of effort to remove and replace or sharpen the blade. I always sharpen my blade before the start of the mowing season and every other month. When sharpening the blade I use a fine tooth file. It can be sharpened with a good stone too. I got about 5 years out of one blade.Besides replacing the blade the back flap needed some help too. The original flap lasted me about 7 years and wasn't that difficult to remove and replace. Protection wise, Black & Decker offers a two year limited warranty on the mower and a lifetime package on the mower deck. I've not used their toll free customer support number for the mower, but I have for other Black & Decker products. The customer service that I did receive was outstanding.Overall, I am very satisfied with my Black & Decker mower. It has been a reliable lawn tool that quietly and efficiently gets the job done. With proper maintenance I expect to get another eight more years out of this one. In closing, I can honestly say that I don't miss my old gas mowers one bit.",1303689600,2011-04-25

5.0,"It took 3 weeks to catch anything. I tried different baits, etc., until one particular type of dog food worked. I'm still experimenting, and will post back when I find out what works best for me. I was all set to return this, because I thought it did not work. The green light stays lit for only a couple of seconds and then shuts off, but the unit is LIVE so be careful. I have caught three mice in my attic in the last week and I think that it is the different ""bait"" that I am placing into the unit. D batteries make this heavy, which is good. I can't tell you how nice it is to see the red blinking light! And then when you see the little vermin laying there so peacefully....well, the first time I was afraid the little critter was just sleeping. It's a big difference than using the other old-fashioned traps. It certainly seems more humane. The only problem I can see is trying to clean the inside (if you tried to use peanut butter, or something similar). This is pretty close to five stars, and as long as it has some longevity to it, I am very pleased. It is easily portable and you don't have to worry about something wacking your fingers! This should certainly not be placed where a child can get to it or throw something into it (I don't know what would happen, and will not try it, but I don't think it would be good). I would keep it away from any place that can get wet as well. Use nitrile (or latex) gloves when handling/baiting the unit to keep your scent off of it. Also, keep it away from where a pet can get to it! I suspect a ferret or cat may not do too well trying to get the bait. If you don't get something after trying different baits, try moving the unit to another location. I also rubbed the bait on the front of the unit to try to give it more ""scent.""",1294272000,2011-01-06
1.0,"QUICK SUMMARY:  Don't bother with this item.  It just doesn't work (I live in Florida).  Or, if it does work, it doesn't work well enough so you can enjoy the outdoors during the time of day when mosquitos are pesky.  Not recommended!BACKGROUND:  I live in Florida.  There are about 80 species of mosquitoes in Florida, about 30 of which cause problems for humans (search:  ""University of Florida mosquitoes of Florida"").  I selected this items because mosquitos right now (June) are very bad, especially during Florida's raining season, and most especially during dusk and dawn.  I have a pooled deck backyard, so I used this lantern twice:  once at dusk, once at dawn.  Both times the wind was non-existent, and both times I got chowed.  Get this:  I even placed this lantern on the deck, inches from between my feet, and STILL my feet and legs were getting chowed!  I watched one mosquito fly past my chest, down to my right leg, and onto my right foot, which was less than 12 inches from this lantern.  This ""Backyard Bug Control"" fails miserably in controlling mosquitos in one's backyard - at least the mosquito species that live where I live.  When I positioned the lantern on a patio table inches from where I was sitting, I still got chowed on my arms, feet and legs.WHAT I LIKED:- The unit came with a set of batteries and one scent cartridge- The fan was very quietWHAT I DISLIKED:- The scent cartridge was surprisingly and frustratingly hard to open up- The on/off switch requires using two hands to slide the switch to the on or off position- The LED lights appear to have no useful function other than to indicate that the fan is turned on.  They're too dim to create any kind of ambient light.WHAT I HATED:- Even with this lantern inches from my upper torso or from my feet, I got chowed by mosquitos; it just doesn't work, at least not where I live (Florida)CONCLUSION:  Buy this only if you like feeding nature...with your body.",1370649600,2013-06-08
5.0,"I've been cutting the lawn on my hilly quarter-acre lot with a Scotts push mower.  My lawn came back thick and lush this spring, which I attribute to sheer luck rather than any skill on my part, and it was quite difficult to cut the grass with the Scotts mower.  I ordered this mower.  It is far superior to the Scotts mower (with which I had been quite happy until this spring).  It is quieter.  It cuts thick grass better.  It cuts closer to a fence, tree, or other obstruction (with the left side of the mower only; the right side has the chain that drives the blades and the housing for the drive assembly).  It is less much likely to pick up twigs in its blade and jam the blade with them.It is considerably heavier than the Scotts mower, although it's not so heavy that it's a problem pushing the mower.The manual states quite clearly that the mower won't cut grass more than six inches tall.  Based on my own experience, I'd say that it won't cut grass more than two inches higher than the setting for the height of the cut (the maximum height is four inches, so the manual's statement is true; it just won't cut six-inch-high grass unless the mower is set at the maximum cut height).  I'd recommend that Amazon include this fact on the page for the mower, however, so that buyers aren't disappointed.Assembly took less than ten minutes; it probably would have taken longer if I hadn't had an 11-mm socket for my ratchet drive.  I do recommend reading the assembly instructions all the way through before starting to assemble the mower; doing so kept me from putting some things together that needed to wait for another piece.I've mowed my lawn six times with this mower now, and it has satisfied me in every way imaginable.",1371427200,2013-06-17

3.0,"Living in a small, rural village in a part of town that contains a couple of debilitated houses and several farms, we often find our small house infested with mice. I have tried all sorts of methods to capture and kill these mice (mice can carry many diseases and they are capable of reproducing quickly so we don't let them live). A little while ago, I was presented with the opportunity to try the NOOSKI MOUSE TRAP and gave it a try. I set the ring in the trap, but with some difficulty, and set it out in the garage.The trap worked as a few days later there was a dead mouse on the ground nearby with one of the Nooski green rings around its neck.Even though the NOOSKI MOUSE TRAP works, I don't like it. The branding on the package and the marketing materials that accompany it say that it is a more humane way to kill mice. The NOOSKI MOUSE TRAP might be a more humane way to kill mice versus a glue trap, but more humane than other methods is questionable. After all, the trap works as a strangulation device that suffocates the mouse to death.If you don't like mice or are the least bit squeamish, the NOOSKI MOUSE TRAP is not a good mouse trap for you.Also, the trap is somewhat difficult to set the first few times using it; there's a learning curve involved in how the thing operates. I don't think there should be any type of learning curve when it comes to using mousetraps.Personally, out of all the mouse traps I've used the past few years (and there have been several), my favorite remains the ORTHO HOME DEFENSE KILL AND CONTAIN. That trap actually traps the mouse until it's dead, too and you can through the entire trap away without having to look at the dead mouse.Overall, the NOOSKI MOUSE TRAP is an innovative way to kill mice. There's a bit of a learning curve involved in figuring out how to set the trap, but if set properly, it should work. It's not really any more humane or less humane than other mouse traps, just know beforehand that you'll have to dispose of the dead mice who suffocate around the device.",1350432000,2012-10-17

3.0,"If you live in an area where you need a large capacity feeder to keep your hummingbirds happy, it's hard to imagine how this feeder would not suit your needs. That said, I did see comments on a review where the person said they have several and are still refilling daily! This feeder was made for those situations, but sadly, those of us that do not have swarms of hummers in their yards will do more dumping of unused juice.Assuming that your situation is the former, and you need 1.5 quarts of juice to keep your hummers happy, you'll find that the plastic cylinder is very easy to clean. It has a wide mouth that makes thorough cleaning a snap. However, the base is nearly impossible to clean properly, as the liquid fills the base, with the recessed areas very hard to reach and clean effectively. If you have any liquid in the cylinder when it comes time to clean, have a place to drain quite a bit of liquid out of the base when you tip it over or take it apart in the sink.In the four weeks that I tested this feeder, I did find that the ruby throated hummingbirds we have here did use it without any issues. Our birds are very territorial, so we never get more than one at a feeder at a time. I was really hoping that the number of ports on this feeder, and the fact that we had six feeders spread around the yard at one time would encourage more birds to be visible at once, but that didn't happen.Just recently, I have found that getting the cylinder to fit into the base is more difficult; almost as if it is going slightly out of round or something. It's not a big deal, as it just takes some patience to put the pieces together.Filling this with 48 ounces of sugar water means that it's going to have some weight, so a sturdy hanger is a necessity. Fortunately, the metal hanger at the top of the cylinder is up to the task. I never had a concern about it breaking and falling, but the shallow clearance requires a proper hook so you don't have to tilt the feeder. An added plus is that the red cap with the hanger screws off the cylinder, which has a flat top, so you can fill the inverted cylinder while it stands on a counter and then screw the top on to hang it. Having these separate parts makes replacements possible as well so heavy users should have some options in that regard.Durability doesn't seem to be a problem, as it was dropped onto a tile floor from a height of about three feet, and all that happened was that one of the feeder port flowers popped out. It snapped back in without any trouble, and nothing else cracked or broke as a result of the bouncing it took.Overall, this is too much feeder for many situations. But for those that need the capacity, this is one of the few I've seen that will hold this much juice. While the base is a little unwieldy when it comes to cleaning, I'm not sure there's a better way to build it and still serve six ports with this much juice. If it weren't for the hard-to-clean crevices in the base, I'd give it a solid four stars.",1402531200,2014-06-12

It is good for a place that has milder winters, or for a grill that you want to cover that is already on a covered deck or carport.

This gives good air circulation for the covered grill so any condensation will dry off during the day.",1345680000,2012-08-23
5.0,"We've been feeding the little hummer for years, so when I ordered this &#34;new and improved&#34; feeder I expected one very similar to the ones we already own. Mrs. Spudman, who makes the sugar water for the hummingbirds is very happy with this new feeder.  We like all of its features -  the built in bee guard, the easy to clean base, the built in ant moat, and most especially the wide mouth fill. With the wider opening of the glass nectar repository, the feeder is easier to fill and much easier to clean.Amazingly, within several minutes of hanging his new feeder our first hummer of the season made its appearance. Since then we've had regular visits to the feeder which sits a few feet outside our large kitchen window.We're using the included red-colored nectar, but once it's been consumed we'll got back to the homemade brew without the dye.My only reservation about this feeder is the handy, but very small, built in ant moat. It appears to do its job, but on hot days the water is sure to evaporate quickly and need multiple refills. I actually prefer our large, clear ant moat that we hang above our hummingbird feeders. Small birds like to drink from these &#34;moats&#34;, and I like watching the chickadees use them to  bathe and splash about on hot, summer days.",1398556800,2014-04-27
5.0,"I have had good success with Strathwood products, the best and most notable being theStrathwood Basics Picnic Table, which was easy to put together, looks good and continues to weather well and last through heat and cold out on our back deck. Sensing that these would make nice chairs to use with the picnic table, I snatched them up.The chairs came double packaged in a large cardboard box, with the chair nested in one protective box, and then that box inserted into a second, heavier, well-taped box. Both chairs arrived safe, sound, and unblemished. Although the chairs are of a light, sturdy aluminum make, two stacked together in cardboard are still pretty heavy, so some buyers may want to be home when these are delivered so they get put where you want.The wife and I both love the look of the chairs. They are extremely comfortable, and mesh fabric gives them a strong but airy feel. The arm rests are nicely positioned, and the whole frame has a slight amount of flex to give the chairs a little more of a cushiony feel. The color is nice and will go with just about any outdoor d&eacute;cor. And they are comfortable (did I say that?). Although we haven't sat in them for any appreciable amount of time, I'm confident we'll be able to relax and lounge on our deck with these for some time to come. We are very satisfied with this product and think it will be hard to beat these chairs on price and performance without getting something much heavier and bulkier, which is why I'm declaring this another five star product from Strathwood.",1394582400,2014-03-12

5.0,"I purchased this grill locally to avoid any issues. None so far. Hardware store offered free assembly so I took advantage of this. I am so tired of cheap units that rust and disintegrate after 3 years. This is a much better grill which should last for a while. It fired right up and took no time to reach cooking temp. You have to keep a close eye on the clock not to overdue the food. I did order the grease pan inserts and lined with foil to make cleanup a little easier.I do not think I will be disappointed this time.  Update; Aug 5th. Now having used this grill for a period of time this has been the perfect solution to all grilling issues. I ordered from Amazon the plastic propane scale and secured it with cable ties to the tank rack. I cut a small opening in the wind rack for the button display and now all I have to do is take cover off and push a button to see the display of propane that is left  in the tank. After purchasing all the cheap grills over the years, I realize I should have purchased this gem earlier. Gee, all the money and frustration.",1339632000,2012-06-14

I previously had an electric blower which was very powerful, but not very convenient for obvious reasons (corded).This is 75% as powerful as the electric, which is more than enough for light home use (blowing out the garage, driveway, pathways around the property, etc).  Keep in mind that you need to mix gas with oil for this, so order the oil as well (not included).  It started right up on the 2nd pull.  Its not as loud as I thought it would be.  If you don't use it regularly, be sure to use a fuel stabilizer or empty the fuel lines.",1390780800,2014-01-27
5.0,"This is a great hedge trimmer made by Black and Decker.  The trimmer is quiet and because it is electric, it starts and stops instantly.  The handle is sort of thick so squeezing the trigger and cutting for more than 5 minutes at a time might make your hand cramp (that's what happens to me and I am 200 pounds).  It states it can cut branches 3/4 inch, and it is true.  With enough tenacity, you can cut up to 1 inch branches.  When branches are too thick and get cut in the trimmer, it automatically shuts off.  You then have to unjam it to restart it.Battery life is somewhat decent.  I got about 30 minutes of use out of one battery with a few minutes break in-between.  Highly suggested to have a spare battery charged and ready to go while you are using this.  There is no option to connect a cord to it, only battery.The batteries are interchangeable with other 18 volt B&D; tools, which is a huge plus.  I have the complete set of blower, weed whacker and this trimmer.  If you need a complete set, check out the Lawn Care set.  That comes with a 3 battery charger (3 batteries) and hanging kit to organize the tools.The charger that is supplied with it is a ""dummy"" charger.  It does not know when the battery is full and you have to keep an eye on how long you have had it plugged in.  Recommendations are to not have it charged for more than 8 hours.  I normally charge my battery in the morning and then use it in the afternoon.All in all, this is a great trimmer.  It is silent and powerful.  You can get a lot of work done without worrying about disturbing your neighbors because it makes very little sound.I highly recommend this tool.",1257292800,2009-11-04

I had to change the liquid often because of the amount of canning that I do - but this product was simply wonderful at keeping the fruit flies controlled.

So outside I noticed swarming of ants in different locations in the landscaping.  I also noticed that when it rained carpenter ants would come out of certain cracks near the foundation.  So I got the Terro 901 Ant Killer shaker bag.  We'll see in the coming months if it can eliminate the ant problem near the house.  As far as application goes, the bag is designed to spread the ant killer from the bag.  You don't need a spreader.  That is so convenient.I will post in a month or so and report how my ant population is doing.  I have high hopes, however, because Terro has so far not let me down.",1371340800,2013-06-16
4.0,"The purpose of a lawn aerator is to treat dried, brown or troubled lawn areas in order for air, water, and fertilizer to reach and nourish the grass roots.  I've used the Hound Dog brand of aerator for years with good results and  was eager to give this Yard Butler brand a try.Likes:*Coring aerators punches out a soil &#34;plug&#34; which is better than spike aerators that just pushes/compacts soil around the holes.*Simple to use, just step on the lower bar to aerate the soil and push out the plugs.  Logic dictates that placing the aerating tubes perpendicular to the lawn will result in less effort and plugs cleanly punched out.*T-handle for a good grip when lifting up the aerator.*Newer design with beveled, smaller diameter lower section of aerator tubes resulted in less plugs stuck inside.What I've learned over the years of aerating lawns:*Only need to aerate dry, brown, troubled spots, NOT the entire lawn.*The soil need to be just right: Too damp, DON'T need aerating, and the plugs will get stuck.  Too dry, aerating tubes can't punch through and the cutting edges are dulled. The solid needs to be just damp enough for the aerating tubes to punch through and cleanly push out the plugs.*The old Hound Dog aerator just has an unbreakable U-shaped handle, unlike the Yard Butler aerator which has a welded T-handle.  I'm extra careful not to push down on the handle, and just lift the handle gently during removal from the soil.*Some damp plugs will get stuck occasionally, just push it out by stepping on some slightly damp soil.  I wouldn't use a screwdriver to pry out the plugs because that may roughen up the inner surfaces of the aerating tubes and cause more plugs to get stuck.*Just get a tube or stick that's slightly smaller in diameter than the aerating tubes and punch out the stuck plugs.*Be careful not to bend or distort the cutting edges will lead to more stuck plugs.Overall:Good for treating sections of troubled, brown, dried lawn.  For major, large lawn aerating, hire a pro or rent out a power tiller/aerator.",1401580800,2014-06-01
5.0,"Last summer was the first that I used my Tanglefoot traps. I set one in the front yard and one in the back. Grossly, I think I captured a bazillion of them in just a month or so. Each time I emptied the traps, I was amazed by the volume of the catch. The trap is probably 6"" in diameter and 10"" or so tall, and they would be completely full of this little buggers (literally, little buggers). This got me thinking that there isn't a lot of thinking that goes on inside the heads of Japanese beetles. If you were out for a walk and saw a hole with about 10,000 people trapped in it, would you jump into it? Of course not, but if you were a Japanese beetle, you'd think THE MORE THE MERRIER, and you would jump right in. This trap provides yet another opportunity for parents to teach kids the hazards of doing what everybody else does, just because you were following the crowd. One moment, you are flying around enjoying the world, the next minute you are stuck in a trap and you are too dumb to get out of it, even though it doesn't have a door or cover on it.So, in summary, this product works great, and it provides a great metaphor for life.",1376265600,2013-08-12

I leave it zipped and fold down the wings on the grill so I don't have to mess with the zippers. They are a royal pain to zip up. It is nearly impossible to zip them up without snagging some of the fabric near the zipper.

5.0,"The title for this item is a bit misleading. (18&#34; Basting Mop With 2 Replacement Heads). As the continued description states, it comes with TWO detachable machine washable heads...1 head attached and 1 replacement head, 2 heads total as shown in the picture.Up until now I have been contending with nylon bristled, and silicon bristled basting brushes. While they have their good uses in the kitchen for small jobs, they fall far short with many jobs on the grill. You simply can not quickly apply large quantities of sauce/marinade with those types. Also, most have very short handles which forces your hands down too close to the heat and that takes away from the fun of grilling.This is the perfect grilling companion for quickly slopping your sauces onto your meats. It provides quick and easy coverage with a long and sturdy handle so you can get the job done fast and get back to your beer, your lady friend, or whatever. I can not recommend this basting mop enough for anyone who does a lot of BBQ such as racks of ribs. You can really slop a lot of sauce on quickly.The heads screw onto the handle securely so they will not be coming loose in the middle of the job. For cleanup, I removed the head and only hand-washed the handle. I hand-washed the head under running water with a bit of dish soap to get the majority of the sauce out and then I tossed it into the dishwasher along with my dishes to get it looking as clean as new again. I allow it to air dry well before storing it away with the handle. I anticipate the handle and the heads holding up very well.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope you love this basting mop as much as I do.",1401840000,2014-06-04
4.0,"We have had a couple mice take up residence in our home unfortunately. They were flipping over our traps and taking the bait without taking the punishment which wasn't working towards ridding us of our problem. I wasn't sure what to expect from these bait stations but was hoping the mice would be interested enough to wander in there and eat the bait. Sure enough, the first night they went for the bait station over the peanut butter trap. They ate about a sixth of the brick the first night, more the next night, and again for a few nights beyond that. I have no idea if it was the same mouse or multiple mice, but bottom line is- we have no more signs of mice and nothing is going for the bait anymore. I assume they made their way out of the house and died, because we have not found any signs or smells of dead mice inside the house. I really don't much care how it works, only that it works!

No change; I just chased two cats out of the covered area this morning; the product does not seem to bother them at all.  In order to cover the entire exterior perimeter (four-inch wide band) of my lot, I would need 2 and  containers; the label also indicates that one application only lasts up to 30 days, assuming you apply it as directed, only on sunny, dry days.  The annual cost for me to use this product would, therefore, be:  2.5 containers x $27.09 (current cost per container) x 12 months, equals $812.70.

You will know you got one as the door will be covered and the lever is flipped.It is very easy to use (the manufacturer has a video on the main page). Just put the peanut butter as a bait, turn the lever counter-clockwise until it locks, and it is ready to use.But it is an expensive way of doing it. One-use and you need to discard it. A lot of plastic material is also used in this product - lots of waste.Last thing, although the trap is big, the mouse that can be caught with this device is only the really small mice.

4.0,"This is a very well made brush that is good for feeder ports, especially hummingbird feeders.  So far for me it's been tough enough that after several uses its still holding its shape, and without shedding.  I like it and feel it is well worth the price here on Amazon, (especially with the free shipping that is being offered at the time of this writing).  The only thing I feel I should make extra note of is its really small size.  It's only 3 1/2"" long, which makes it kinda useless for anything but ports on feeders.  If you want to get down to the bottom of a tube feeder where it really gets nasty over time, you will need to pick up a long bottle brush.  Also, if you do buy this brush for use on feeder ports, I would toss the suggestion of keeping it around your sink for other uses that's mentioned in the description.  You will be bringing in all kinds of bacteria from dirty feeders into your kitchen.  You can wash it well of course, but it's still a better idea to either keep one of these strictly for other uses than feeders, or buy some other brush for your kitchen sink.

Once they have been growing for two weeks the package recommends removing all but one seedling and we are just about at that point.After my experience so far I would recommend this system hands down for the gardening-impaired and those looking for the easy way out.",1371254400,2013-06-15
4.0,"I purchased this sweeper for my 82 year-old father-in-law that suffers from severe arthritis in his hands.  He loves to garden and work outside but has increasing difficulty using his tools.  The sweeper is very lightweight and easy to grasp for him.  Assembly time/difficulty was minimal and he didn't have to fumble with cords like his other blower.  The noise levels are lower than a normal blower and it handles most sweeping jobs.  I gave it four stars because it could have been a little bit stronger.  I know its not a leaf blower but some sweeping jobs were a little more difficult than others.  Despite this one drawback, my father-in-law loves it.",1365206400,2013-04-06
4.0,"I've had a number of pressure washers both electric and gas. I currently use a gas powered pressure washer for just about everything. When I had the chance to review this electric one I had some concerns over it because I've used electric in the past and typically the build quality just isn't up to my expectations.This pressure washer is pretty cool to look at. Yes it's large but if you consider this an auto detail pressure washer it's perfect. It has wheels, soap dispensers, a vacuum that sits on top, multiple attachments, it's not so powerful it blasts the paint off. This is an overall good looking auto pressure washer.This is NOT in my experience after using it a good pressure washer for removing hard grime from the side of your house. I'm sure you could get chemicals that would assist but the basic pressure behind this thing doesn't give it enough power to clean vinyl siding, at least not on my house. My gas one does however have the power to clean, without the need of any harmful chemicals.Something else that concerns me with this pressure washer are the connections. They seem really cheap and in fact for me where the hose attached had some leaking. I was able to remedy this with some plumbers tape and wrapped the threads before attaching the hose, but the fact is it leaked pretty bad after a short period. I would have liked to seen strong, metal connectors that were tight.In the end, I would recommend this if you wanted an auto retailers pressure washer without a lot of power, something to clean the car, backyard furniture or very light ""power cleaning."" I would not recommend this for other uses like taking paint off a deck, or cleaning vinyl siding, blasting gum off your driveway, etc. For that you need something with more power like gas or a higher dollar electric. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the leaking connections I had to resolve. I like the footprint of this is larger, it keeps it stable and upright.",1342656000,2012-07-19

5.0,"I do a lot of my gardening on my knees as I find it easier on my bad back. Until I purchased Fiskars Kneelers Knee Pads I used a pad that I knelt on.  The problem with the pad, of course, is that you have to get up before moving to a new spot.  It is much easier to garden with the knee pads attached to your legs.  I am very pleased with this purchase.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.The photo shows both sides of the knee pads.  The top image shows the outer shell of the pad that touches the ground. It is made out of thick (slight under 1/2 inch) rubberized material which provides cushioning and protection from moisture.The bottom image show the inside part of the knee pad, which is made with soft black non-slippery material.  The cavity of the knee pad is 4.75 inches wide, and 7 inches long. It can be made more narrow by tightening the knee straps or wider by pressing on it with the knee because it flexes.Each knee pad has a rubber band which holds the knee pad to the leg. Each band is 20 inches long and 1.5 inches wide.  At each end of the rubber band there is 3.5 inches of Velcro so you can adjust the pad based on the size of your leg.  If your legs are particularly skinny you can sew in additional Velcro strip so you can close it tighter.  If your legs are thicker you can add another piece of rubber band with more Velcro.  I consider myself an average size woman and I got a perfect fit with and without long pants on.The knee pads are easy to clean by washing them with a hose.  They are solidly made and feel like a good quality item.Fiskars offers lifetime warranty for the knee pads.  Even if when I don't plan  on using a warranty replacement, it always makes me feel good about a product when the company shows the confidence in the product by offering such long warranty.  For warranty service, email warranty@fiskars.com or call 1-866-348-5661 or contact Fiskars Brands, Inc. 2537 Daniels Street, Madison, WI 53718.I am really enjoying my knee pads, in particular because I can move so much easier with them than a knee pad I used before.  I recommend this product.Ali Julia review",1332720000,2012-03-26
5.0,"I love this little sprinkler. With our community's 60 pound water pressure it covers a decent sized area. It throws pretty large drops so the water falls back onto the lawn instead of blowing or evaporating away. And it doesn't take long to saturate an area.I did notice that since it has such a low profile, longer blades of grass next to it can get caught in the flow and interfere with the spray pattern. I just pluck them out of the way before I turn on the sprinkler. I'm not sure the pattern is all that sharp of a square, but it is square-ish, and that's good enough in our yard.I think it's a great sprinkler for kids to play in. It has no moving parts to break and no sharp edges to step on. And the flow can be adjusted downward until it's a gentle bubbler. It is cast iron and weighs a pound or two, so it could be painful if one of the kids decides to swing it around on the end of the hose like a mace. Other than that it should be great for play on a hot summer afternoon.The sprinkler technology here is vintage and bone simple -- it's a cast iron chamber with a little hole in the top. There's nothing to fail or break. With a little care -- very little -- it will last for years and years. You might want to smear a little grease in the threads to keep them from rusting, and occasionally remove it from the hose end to keep the two from rusting together. Every few years a spritz of spray paint will keep it looking like new.",1245456000,2009-06-20

3.0,"It's been in the garage for 2 weeks, I can hear things scampering around, but so far, no kills.It looks like a good concept. There's a kill chamber, and the dead mouse drops into a bin. The bin holds a number of kills. If you have a mice problem that requires the assistance of a Pied Piper, this could be the solution.The trouble I have could be that this time around, it is rats, not mice. There's no way a mouse can squeeze into the chamber. I've always used spring traps so far, and the problem with the traps is that they're a hazard to leave lying around when engaged, and once I caught a mouse in a rat trap. It didn't kill it outright. I don't like mice and rats in my garage, but I don't want them to suffer either.I believe the electronic rat trap (M240) would work better for me. It kills both mice and rats, and being able to kill only one at a time is not a problem for me.Other than not suitable for my needs, the product itself is well constructed. It even comes with batteries (heavy duty, not alkaline, though). When you open up the kill chamber, it turns itself off so that you don't shock yourself. There's also a separate switch. One improvement I can think of is to make this mains powered, but perhaps this is a safety vs. cost of operation tradeoff.",1312416000,2011-08-04
4.0,"I live on an acre lot in a rural subdivision. White-tail Deer are a daily nuisance inthe neighborhood and over the spring and summer, I used Deer Off to help protectazaleas, day lilies, and other ornamental plants around the yard.During this time deer continued to come into the yard on a regular basis but theydid not nibble on the treated plants nearly as much as when I left them untreated inearlier years.I sprayed three times in a six-month period through early fall with one extraspraying after three days of heavy rain. The battery-powered sprayer worked welland was easy to control. You do need to shake the container well before and duringuse so that the sprayer will not clog up. I had to unscrew the nozzle and clean it upa few times but that wasn't a big problem. The product smells pretty bad as you arespraying, but the odor goes away quickly (at least for humans) once it dries.All in all Deer-Off is an effective product that will help keep deer from eating yourplants. Bear in mind that flowers and new growth that come out after you spray arenot treated and are subject to getting munched.

5.0,"Spotting hummingbirds in your garden can be a really exciting event and if you have lots of gardens and lots of nectar-producing plants (even just hanging plants) you will almost certainly attract them. Studies have shown that hummingbirds are attracted to reds and pinks, so I always have red and pink hanging plants near my porch. I live in Connecticut and there are hummers in the garden all summer long, well into the fall.If you really want a consistent stream of visitors though, you're better off putting out one or more feeders. Once the hummers know there is a well-cared-for feeder near by, they'll return to it many times a day. The number of times that they return is partly based on the sugar-to-water ratio that you use in making the food you put in the feeder--the higher the amount of sucrose (table sugar) the less they often they have to feed. There is an excellent article on this on the web but I don't think I'm allowed to post link here. (Just search on feeding hummingbirds.)This feeder offers a pretty big capacity of food (whether you make your own or buy commercially made nectar) and that is a good thing if you have a lot of hummers, but if you only have a few visitors, the food may go stale (or develop dangerous mold) if you don't clean the feeder regularly. It's important to keep any hummingbird feeder clean and to keep the nectar fresh. Fresh is very important to these birds, this is not a feeder you can fill once and forget about. Even if they only drink half, you must pour that out ever few days and give them a fresh supply. So, if you have a lot of hummers, this feeder will be great; if not, I'd probably go for a smaller feeder.The feeder is pretty well made and easy enough to clean. I think the perches might be a bit close to the flowers (feeding outlets) but I'm not sure. I have just put this out, so I'll know shortly. I'm in Connecticut and the hummers are here now, so I should have visitors soon. I'm not sure why they used white flowers, most feeders use either red or yellow, but we'll see, that might be fine. This book would probably be a big help:Hummingbirds of North America: Attracting, Feeding, and PhotographingOne small note: The feeder comes with a small s-hook (look under the lid when you open it, it's taped there) but it's pretty much useless for hanging the feeder. I would go to the garden store and buy a longer s-hook--the kind that are made for hanging plants (or just make one from an old metal hanger).I like that the feeder fills from the top (much simpler than the bottom-fillers that you have to flip over once you fill them) and the fill opening is big, so it's easy to pour into it. Overall a very nice feeder, I'll update this once I get some customers.",1369958400,2013-05-31

The feeder is exactly as pictured and seems to be very good quality so I don't have any problem recommending this feeder to anyone with hummingbirds in the area and who can keep it away from the ants.",1372032000,2013-06-24

5.0,"Shipping & Assembly: These chairs came fully assembled, which meant that they were ready to go right out of the box. It also meant that they came in a rather large box! The two chairs were stacked, and were very well packaged and padded, so they came without a scratch.Appearance: The first thing that I noticed when I unwrapped the chairs is that there was some dimpling along the arms of the chairs. I presume that this was from the manufacturing process, when the metal for the arms was bent into shape. The dimpling is not bad, and does not seem to distract from the look of the chairs. Indeed, one doesn&#8217;t expect outdoor chairs to be works of art.That said, though, they are quite attractive chairs, and look great on my deck.Feel: The chairs are nice and comfortable with the webbing for the seat and back hitting in the right spots. Indeed, these are much more comfortable than my old chairs!Construction: The chairs are of a sturdy construction and give you a good feeling of support. I also get the feeling that they will last a good long time. Their weight is about the same as my old chairs, which means that I can easily carry one a long way, or move two around the yard.Conclusion: I think that these are great chairs, and I am very glad that I have them.

4.0,"I've painted with brushes, rollers, small air compressor guns and spray paint cans, as I use what ever will give me the best smoothest streak free finish for my many house and yard paint projects. This Wagner Flexio 590 Indoor/Outdoor Hand Held Sprayer System will give me the professional smooth finishes I need in my painting in way, way less time. This system comes with the X-Boost Turbine handle, the iSpray nozzle, the detail finish nozzle, 2 filters in the Turbine handle, 2 funnels, a practice spray poster, thinning accessory, a carrying case to hold everything in and the owner's manual.  The directions are extremely thorough and after reading everything and practicing using this sprayer's 2 different nozzles, you will be so pleased with the perfect professional results, you will not want to use a brush or roller ever again.As with all paint jobs, prep work is everything, and it is no different with a hand held sprayer. You want to clean whatever it is you are painting first and mask the border. I found the overspray to be minimal with this sprayer, but masking is still needed. Once you are ready for painting, just be sure you do a couple of practice sprays first, to get the feel of the sprayer and to see how keeping the handle straight and steady with even sweeping motions will keep the sprayer from spitting or spraying too thin or thick. You'll see that moving constantly and distance is everything also. When you first use the practice poster with the iSpray nozzle, you will see that you will be 6-12 inches away to get a spray of 10 to 12 inches wide. Then when you practice with the detail finish nozzle, you'll find you'll spray 1 to 6 inches away for a spray 1/2 inch to 3 inches wide. Steady, straight sweeping motions will give you perfect results.Once you mix the material you will be using, you will want to adjust the controls by setting your air power and material flow control. The materials you use with the iSpray nozzle can be from thin sealers to medium polyurethanes to heavy latex paints or primers. The incredible thing about this iSpray nozzle is that you don't have to thin the materials with water. You can thin them if you like, as it will mean cleaning the nozzle hole less while painting, but I found that when I sprayed constantly and steadily for a while the sprayer didn't clog or spit until I stopped to rest my arm and began again. At this point I simply unclogged the sprayer hole with the thinning accessory, did a practice spray and went back to spraying again. The thinning accessory tells you how much water to add to the container to thin your paint or material besides having a tip to keep the nozzle hole clean.As for the detail finish nozzle, this sprayer hole is so tiny, you absolutely have to thin your material no matter what you are using to paint or stain with. Thinning is a must for this detail nozzle and you will be impressed with the perfect results you will get. For both nozzles, you can adjust the spray shape, but you can only adjust the spray width on the iShape nozzle.The owner's manual also covers proper spraying techniques for both wide and detailed spraying. I find that simply practicing will give you all you need in learning distance and adjustments to get the results you need. When finished painting, cleanup is unbelievably easy. You basically want to flush the unit with water half full for water based materials or one quarter full of mineral spirits for oil based materials. After flushing, you just take the nozzle apart and I just let it soak in a bucket of soapy water. Then take a soft brush to it, dry and remember to use vaseline on the O ring before putting it back together again. The reassembly of the nozzle is pictured in the manual, so you don't have any worries after it's apart in pieces. The only maintenance you'll have is cleaning the 2 filters and cleaning the air valve tube on the iSpray nozzle.Painting is a huge job, with lots of prep work and cleanup time, so anything that cuts down on the actual time spent painting is a huge plus for me and this Wagner sprayer makes it so much easier with it's super fast wide and detailed sprayers, which can be mastered with just a little practice. Walls, baseboards, trims, ceilings, fences, house siding, furniture, decks and even crafts turn out with a beautiful professional smooth finish when spraying with this great sprayer system and it is definitely a 4 1/2 Star time saver.",1387152000,2013-12-16

4.0,"Very nice chair cover.  Really.  We like it a lot.  From the Dad perspective, it's a solid canvas cover that goes over the chair, and that's all that's needed.  But more importantly, Queen Bee likes it a lot, and that is your target demographic, Classic Accessories.  The only real problem I see is that at close to $50 a pop, while we can afford to put one of these on the other three Adirondacks on the deck to match--and this is very important with the target demographic--the need to get another four each in two separate styles and the matching table cover, and then the matching grill cover is going to be pretty spendy, mighty close to prohibitively spendy.  Nice, sure, but looking at more than $500 for this lovely matching transition has even the Queen Bee admitting it's a bit much.We like the color.  The original canvas covers, which it just so happens are now falling apart, are the traditional oatmeal/sand color, which is nice enough new, but after a summer or two outdoors turns an unattractive bleached-out kinda-white.  And, we notice that the lighter color really highlights the green mold growing on all of the covers.  So, this darker color--the highly evocative and official ""dark taupe/mushroom/espresso""--is so far a winner.  Time will tell how the inevitable weathering will work for this product.The weatherproofing is good, and it's shed water perfectly for the past month.  The fit over the chair has not led to any pooling, which is always a plus.It's got a handle in the front and back, and a vent in the back, but the old cover has the same.  I'm not seeing anything special about these essentially standard features.  This cover has a dash of color variation in the 1"" nylon webbing of the handle.  The product copy says ""webbed handles with extra padding,"" but I'm not seeing the padding.  Nylon webbing makes up the two handles, and there is a tiny bit of softness behind the handle which may legally qualify as padding, but touting it as ""extra padding"" is disingenuous at best.  But then again, who needs padding to use a nylon web handle on a chair cover?  Honestly.The ""structured vent"" is not bad; some tightened-up sewing and a couple of creases do keep it slightly open.  But the vent's mesh screen, while sounding impressive, is utterly superfluous, given that the entire bottom of the cover is completely open.This is a heavy-duty cover, and just putting it over the chair is an undertaking.  The wife likes the elastic drawstring around the bottom.  That's a good addition to keep it all snug over the chair.And to really make sure it doesn't go anywhere you've got the little buckled straps that go around the legs, the ""belted channel attachment system,"" to keep it that much more secure.  This is a nice touch, sure, but it seems overkill.  If the wind is strong enough to lift this roughly four-pound cover off a full-size Adirondack chair, we've got a lot more to worry about than the covers staying on the chairs.  This observation aside, the Queen really loves this little feature; it's another little doo-dad to engage as part of the cover-the-stuff-on-the-deck ritual.Bottom line: this is very nice product outdoor-chair-covering technology.  We've got no complaints about any aspect of it.  But to get everything under the same covers is going to be an expensive endeavor.  This is a hit with the primary domestic team leader, so as other covers wear out, this cover has set a successful precedent for a likely wave of Classic Accessories replacements, the cost be damned!",1377907200,2013-08-31

I assume the former, because this trap seems very good in theory.I've read other reviews where the batteries died quickly and the indicator light died after a few days.  I've had this trap turned on for almost two weeks and the light still shows that it's working.This trap is easy to set and very simple to check and clean.  I just haven't caught any critters yet.The design is interesting.  You open the top hatch and fill the bait section with peanut butter and then close it back up.  With fresh batteries installed, turn the device on and set it someplace where you expect mice to frequent.  There are two little staircases where the mice can climb up into the device.  Then the mice walk through a little maze that looks like a miniature carnival fun-house.  The floor of this maze has metal plates that zap the mouse on contact.  Then a revolving scooper thing brushes the little corpse into the lower collector tray.  The tray opens easily from the side so you can see if you caught anything.  The tray supposedly holds up to ten victims.In theory the whole thing makes sense.  I'll just keep moving it around and see what happens.",1313539200,2011-08-17

5.0,"I've only been splitting wood for about 10 years, but in that time I've gone through 5 axes including this one. Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I've ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn't believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don't leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th. It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood.",1393632000,2014-03-01

4.0,"When the snow thaws I'm left with a torn up lawn from the moles.  I figured that I've give this product a try as it's easy to use and doesn't cost a ton of money.  It was easy to install in my soil.  Every 30 seconds or so a sonic pulse penetrates the soil, sending off a penetrating sound which is irritating to moles and gophers.  I don't find the sound annoying at all as some have said, I hardly notice it and I've been sitting about five feet away reading in my yard.  But the moles will find the sound very annoying and want to leave your yard.  It will also discourage other moles and gophers from doing damage to your yard.  No batteries are required, you just use the sun for the solar panel.  After I inserted the device into the earth, I repaired any damage to the yard that the moles had done during the winter.

4.0,"The Miracle-Gro 18 pod salad garden is basically for someone who wants to either grow their veggies on the patio or in limited space or someone who wants to sample various veggies. Below I cut and pasted the list of veggies from the Amazon website:Salad Garden1 Globe Tomato1 Cherry Tomato1 Cucumber1 Bush Bean2 Loose-Leaf Lettuce2 Butterhead Lettuce1 Romaine Lettuce1 Snap Pea1 Smooth-Leaf Spinach1 Sweet Pepper Plus, the Herb Garden2 Basil2 Cilantro2 DillAs you can see you get one bean, one snap pea, one pepper, two tomatoes (a cherry and regular size) and a cucumber. Obviously if you are planning to feed a family with the one bean and pea pod you are not going to be able to do it. It will probably be good for one salad. This is a mini-garden for one or at the most two people.This was a review product and I got it in mid-summer. My thinking on this was that I'd be able to utilize it in Denver where I live and Las Vegas where I spend significant time. First off I'm not sure when I started watering the pods if they liked the Denver climate or they knew in their little seeds it was late in the summer. I did get some decent lettuce from the five lettuce pods and some spinach from the one spinach pod. They sprouted quickly as lettuce often does and transferred easily to some long rectangular pots. The lettuce wasn't huge when harvested, but it made a good salad and was tasty.  I brought the sprouted tomatoes, cucumber, bean, pea and herbs with me to Vegas. The heat here fried the poor tomato plants immediately (within a few days). The cucumber, bean and pea are still going--they are in pots and I've brought them in during the hottest part of the day. I don't think any of them will make it here in Vegas. Too hot. The herbs (basil, cilantro and dill) all sprouted, but aren't doing anything much. I do have a rather lethal touch with plants, so it is probably me and not the pod seeds. I was really surprised that the basil sprouted as I've heard basil is hard to grow from seed. It is a tiny thing, but hanging in there. The dill and cilantro probably aren't going to make it. I have put them out in the early morning and late evening to enjoy the sun, but the heat seems too much for them.I don't think this is a bad set, but I do think the beans and peas could be eliminated for something else. What exactly are you going to get from one bean and one pea plant? Not much. I should have poked around in the seed pod to see if there was more than one seed, but I did not. I got one plant from each pod. Same goes for the tomatoes.This would be a fun set to introduce children to gardening and the joy of salad eating! Not sure it will do much for adults. And the Vegas' climate is much too hot for most of these plants!",1377820800,2013-08-30
3.0,"At first look this product looks like you just stick it in the ground, water it and you'll have a wonderful herb and veggie garden. It's an appealing idea, but in truth, some of the pods need to be first planted inside and then later transplanted outside. Also, planting times vary from climate to climate. As other reviewers have mentioned, this plants would produce very little actual food. You can get a lot more garden for the money by going with seeds or plants and doing a little research. This is more of a gimmick for the first time gardener. Not recommended.",1377734400,2013-08-29
5.0,"01/23/2013 update: This fall I removed the old traps and put new ones in place.  I haven't seen an ant inside the house since then.  Normally I get several every day when the weather turns cool.  This is very unusual and I have to assume that the traps are the reason.I'll be using these traps from now on.  They're reasonably priced, a whole bunch cheaper than hiring someone to spray outside, and they seem to be working.  No complaints here.Original 07/18/2013 review: Without fail, every spring and autumn I find a good amount of ants in my kitchen and my bathroom.  They're really just stragglers--I never have a solid line of ants on a mission or a colony inside the house. But I get a LOT of them, a few every day for a few weeks.  I get several different kinds of ants, from large carpenter ants to tiny biting ants.  I've used several different baits and sprays outside and inside the house.But this year I put these baits outside the house, near those two rooms.  So far this year I've had exactly one carpenter ant inside the house.  It might be coincidence, but I doubt it.  I think these traps are what finally solved the problem for me.They're easy to use.  Snap off the stakes and place where needed, then push and twist.  Insert the stakes through the holes in the baits into the ground if you like.  I did that and they've stayed in place through some pretty heavy rainstorms.They're easy to use and they seem to have solved my ant problem for me.  I'll be testing new baits this September, but right now I have to say that they work well for Florida ants.",1374105600,2013-07-18
4.0,More fun than a barrel of monkeys! These arrived happy and healthy on the third business day after ordering. I was worried about the heat in the mailbox but if you follow the tracking info (yes there is tracking with the cheap shipping. Don't believe the notice to the contrary) you can get them right away. They were about as healthy and happy as a bunch of bugs can be! They were downright rambunctious. They have a distinct aroma that reminded me of my childhood and a jars of ladybugs we would collect. The packing was perfect with ample ventilation and some shavings inside to cushion them.  I suggest that you get a batch just for the fun of it.  I released them after sunset and squirted the bug food around. They are self dispensing. All it takes id a small slit in the mesh and they all crown through it. They start eating right away.  In the morning I was able to find seven of them. I am sure there are more somewhere though. Here in Palm Beach County in May it is 82 degrees Fahrenheit at sundown so they aren't slowed down by cool temps and they can still fly. We also have an army of small hungry lizards who welcome anything that moves. I am going to get more bugs! I may try the Coca Cola to glue the wings closed trick so they stay put and hope the lizards aren't the problem. I'll add to the review and let you know if there are any long term bugs.PSNo bugs left at all. It was still worth it for entertainment.,1368489600,2013-05-14

It's very durable and functional, but I can't really say that it's ""pretty"".  The pictures show this base being used with a table, but in my opinion, if you have a table then you probably would use a different base that's a lot less expensive than this one that doesn't have to be as sturdy as this one.  This base is more suited for a stand-alone base for an umbrella.  I like the fact that it's large. . . square and flat.  This makes it easy to place something on top of it.

2.0,"Two summers ago I was so excited to get this. I live in a small town in Northern Minnesota, along the North Shore. With Lake Superior in front of us, and the forest behind us, we have no shortage of mosquitoes here. People from Minnesota often joke about how the mosquito is our state bird, because they are so large and abundant here. I couldn't wait to try this Mosquito Magnet out, and assumed I would be emptying the trap of bugs constantly.When it arrived, I sat down with the instructions for putting it together and setting it all up. Everything went together perfectly and when I turned it on I could hear the fan/motor running. I then turned it off, picked up the packing materials and threw them in the trash. About an hour later, I went back outside to our (fenced in) back yard where the Mosquito Magnet was set up and turned it on. Nothing happened. I tested the power cord, it was getting electricity. I was stumped, so I went inside and started reading the handbook that came with the unit, going through the trouble shooting section.After going through every possible fix in the handbook, I went to the Mosquito Magnet website. I thought perhaps there they may have some ideas. I was thrilled to find instructional videos on troubleshooting this very problem. I watched them all, and tried every fix suggested. Nothing worked, so I went in and watched them again to see if there was something I had missed. I tried everything, from clearing the propane lines to getting a brand new tank. I even tried the suggested fix of picking it up (and it's heavy) and shaking it, so that the weights on the inside would be evenly distributed again. I worked on it for days. Then when I gave up, my husband worked on it. When he gave up, my father (someone who can fix just about anything) had a go at it. After my father tinkered with it for a week, he gave it back to me, having no luck. I put it away for the summer, and brought it out again this summer. I found it and decided I needed to ether get it working, or get rid of it. So after fiddling with it all over again, and still having no luck, I've determined it's dead. The motor is the only thing not working. Everything is receiving power and all the lines are clear, with all new equipment attached to it. Unfortunately, it appears the motor only worked for 2 minutes before completely failing. This was very disappointing.",1345420800,2012-08-20

5.0,"Gilmore sprinkler gives you a lot of control of how far the water shoots and the shape of the circle.  I have been using it now for two weeks, and I am very pleased with its performance. This is my first sprinkler of this type so I got a bit soaked figuring out how to set it up exactly as I wanted, so I am adding detailed instructions and photos of the controls.My goal was to set up a 220 degree semi-circle, leaving a small wedge where I can exit the basement and approach the sprinkler without getting soaked.  The distance of how the sprinkler head rotates to the left or the right is controlled by two red levers around the head. The lever on the RIGHT hand side control how far the head rotates to the LEFT, and the lever on the LEFT hand side controls how far the head rotates to the RIGHT. (see photo)The distance of how far the spray shoots is controlled by a red ring which pushes on the back of the head.  The higher the ring is lifted the shorter is the spray, when the ring is at its lowest the water shoots the furthers away.  How high the ring is lifted is controlled by the pegs that you can reach beneath the sprinkler (see photo of the sprinkler upside down). When you push on the pegs from below they raise the ring.  When you push on the ring from above, you lower the ring.  You can control each individual peg, so you have a lot of control and can create a pretty intricate shape for your watering needs.If you need to the sprinkler to make 360 circle, you need to pull the medal clip towards you.The sprinkler comes assembled with female hose-end connector with shut-off valve and male hose-end adapter. For some reason the sprinkler's shut-off valve does not want to stay facing up, so I found it easier to turn the sprinkler on and off using the shut-off valve on the spigot.I have been watering the newly planted lawn twice a day. The sprinkler is working very well. I am pleased with precision of the watering I was able to achieve avoiding various areas that should not get wet yet getting water to everything I wanted to water.Updated 10/13/11After 4.5 months of twice a day daily use the sprinkler was still going strong when I packed it up for the winter.  I am still very pleased with it.",1304467200,2011-05-04

It has done a good job of keeping the squirrels from eating all the seed.

2.0,"The Tomcat spin trap design is meant to be a quick clean way to kill and dispose of mice. You set the trap with bait and wait for a mouse to crawl in the somewhat small opening and get killed when it goes for the bait. These traps will only work with small mice, and the kill mechanism is unreliable as some users have noted - sometimes mice will escape without triggering the trap and sometimes when it does strike them they don't die right away. The one main plus with these for squeamish folks is that when a mouse is caught you just throw the trap away with the mouse inside. Of course that means that you can only catch one mouse per trap and then you would need to buy new traps for the future, similar to the glue traps that are commonly sold. These are safer than other traps if you have kids around, but if you really want a reliable way of catching mice these are likely to disappoint. I have found in my experience with multiple types of rat/mouse traps that I like the electric traps the best for indoor use, and if you have a recurring issue those will end up being more economical in the long run since a single trap could be used for many years.",1402185600,2014-06-08

5.0,"My Sip & Seed feeder came assembled. The sides of the silos have a pretty  design on them and the copper-look hanger is  very pretty.  The nifitiness (is that a word) of this feeder came into play when I decided to put water in one silo & seed in the other. The top & bottom pieces can be reversed. One piece has small holes in it; of course this piece is for the seed. The other piece is solid, no holes, for water. There's also a tiny, hard-to-see, embossed emblem on each piece; one emblem depicts water, the other a seedling.  Because mine was assembled, I had to take it apart to get the top & bottom pieces in the right place.After we fill the silo with water, we carry it upside down. Otherwise all the water would spill out. Then we flip it to hang it on our shepherd's hook. We always lose water when we flip it over, but it doesn't bother us.  The silo's seed holes are fairly large, but some fruit pieces got stuck anyway. The next time we filled it, we used a smaller seed mixture. I think a mischievous squirrel has been busy getting to the seed. I haven't seen him yet, but the water container has been emptied twice in 24 hours. I think he's tipping it when he tries for the seed.My husband doesn't have any complaints with the sip & feeder. I'd prefer being able to sit the silos down while filling or even after they're filled. Because of the design they won't sit flat, making them a little more inconvenient to use.

I did not pay for it, but got it free through the Amazon Vine review program.As a product it's well-made and while I think a smart squirrel will still get some food out of it, I do think this will make it difficult for them. The way the food dispenser tilts and wobbles will make it very difficult for an animal to maintain a long grip. They'll fall, and while they'll come back, they'll fall again.My other feeder, the squirrel could just hang out until I squirted him with water. This one will make them work much harder, and hopefully he gets tired of it and moves on.But is that worth $75? I just don't see how. Bird seed's not that expensive, so even if a squirrel does eat a bunch of seed, how long would it take for him to eat $50 worth of seed? However, I only deal with one smart squirrel - so if you've got several, then it's a different issue. Still, the price seems high for what is basically a fun luxury item.This is a big feeder. I have the tallest shepherd's crook, and this hangs down far enough to be difficult to see under the railings of my porch. Luckily, we can see two of the four portals even if it's a little obstructed. The point is that this is a large 3-pound feeder, and will be a big change if you're used to those smaller, cheaper versions.The size is matched with quality. This has some weight to it, and is not one of those cheap plastic models that seems to age very quickly. I think this model will have a longer useful life. I usually get rid of a feeder once a year, usually after winter, but I bet this one would last.Ultimately, while I like the product and I think it's well-made and should live up to most of its claims, the price makes it so I can't go above three stars. But - a $75 feeder that last 4-5 years is better than paying $20 for a new feeder after every winter. So IF this lasts 3-4 years I would have a different opinion.The birds use this fine - like any new feeder, took a few days, but once they got used to it they all sit there and eat all day.",1377648000,2013-08-28

3.0,"My first grill cover for my new Weber grill was from Sears. It lasted about 6 months way down south here in our blazing heat. Moving on from that experience, I thought I'd try a genuine Weber cover for my Weber grill. It was pretty expensive but seemed heavier duty than the Sears. After 18 months it had simply shrunk down too much to get it on or off the grill without having to stretch it. Also, it became very stiff and even brittle. Sure enough, soon it ripped.Having learned that big brand names don't mean much when it comes to grill covers, I came across this Ravenna cover. It is very heavy for a cover. I think that's because it's made of cloth instead of plastic.It fits in an unusual way. When you check among the 3 available sizes you can see that they all have the same height. Mine actually touches the ground all around the grill. It has locking straps that can be looped around the rollers to keep the cover down in the event of some calamity that will likely blow away my home before this cover breaks loose from the grill. As if that is not ""fastened"" enough, you can also pull the cords at the bottom to cinch it up even further like an upside-down tobacco pouch.That fastening system is too much bother for me. The weight and length of this cover keeps it down just fine. I'm sure some folks will love fastening theirs down but some will be like me and not want to bother with it. Just a matter of opinion on that and I'm not scoring the cover down for this.I have one complaint. My cover looks like it was stitched together by someone whose machine either was jamming or who was careless in keeping the spool and bobbin full. Some seams stop in mid track and in other places seams have stitched over long dangly loops of thread. It really looks poor. I question what the use of being able to securely fasten the cover down with straps and cords when it looks like a strong tug will pull some of these seams apart.I went to a school where I had to take a sewing class. If this cover were my assignment there, I'd not have gotten a passing grade on it. In fact, I'm sure I would have gotten a lecture from the teacher on being so careless in my work.Having said that, I'll keep the cover but must knock it down from 5 stars to 3. It seems to be very heavy duty cover but I'm disappointed that mine is stitched together so poorly.",1400630400,2014-05-21

5.0,"Got to love the Havahart traps...  So easy to set the trap.  I was recommended to try marshmallows to trap raccoons, and have had luck in the past using them.  But my new pest, (who moved into an old outhouse), arrived during the rainy season, which is hard on marshmallows, so we used tuna.  I removed the lid of a can of tuna, then squeezed the can until it was warped into oval that was almost closed.  You don't want it easy for the critter to reach through and get the prize, since raccoons are very very crafty...  Place the can in the center of the trap, and wait for morning.  Once you have your pest, you can safely use the handle to lift the cage and transport the animal to parts unknown, then simple roll the cage over, which allows the door to open and the animal to leave.  Good luck!",1308182400,2011-06-16

3.0,"These are very pretty blue globes with fragile stems small enough to service small pots where there isn't much space between the root system and the inner edge of the pot, and sunlight shining through the blue globes is striking.  However, they need to be completely removed from the soil to refill and each time they are reinserted, dirt easily clogs the stem.  There are a several other drawbacks: it isn't easy to see the water level because of the darkness of the glass, the small opening of the stem makes refilling the globe a tedious process and, if your plant growth covers the pot's soil, it can be tricky getting the stem placed back into its previous hole.  Be aware that the weight of the full Aqua globe can tip a small pot.  For pots larger than 6"", I much prefer the Plant Nanny where the stem remains in the soil and only the globe is refilled.  The Plant Nanny globe is clear, sturdy glass, and the water level can be easily seen even from a distance.  The stem and the globe of the Plant Nanny are considerably larger than the Aqua Globe, so buy the Aqua Globes for plants in your 6"" or smaller pots that won't easily tip over and I think you will be happy enough.

4.0,"Word of warning from the start: read and re-read the description. The description mentions &#34;Get up to 70 minutes of run time with the G-MAX 40-volt high-capacity 4 Ah and low capacity 2 Ah Li-Ion Batteries (included with purchase)&#34; which I didn't take as it includes one of each capacity battery. You get one of each which I was not exactly happy about. Additionally, extra 4 AHr batteries cost $149.99 list.On to the real stuff.I started looking at this when considering the various cordless electric mowers that are available. I like it better than the lead-acid battery based cordless mowers due to the size and weight of the batteries and the maintenance required for them. Our gas powered mower was getting annoying with starter cord breaks, oil and gas maintenance, and the self-propelled portion was starting to wear out. It was important to me to go green and make things simpler than gas powered.ProsOut of the box, this was so easy to set up. There was even a slight charge on the batteries to try it out (still, fully charge before use). It said &#34;team lift&#34; on the box but it wasn't that heavy. No tools were need to get this prepped for action.The first thing I noticed was the &#34;push the button, pull a lever and mow&#34; simplicity. There was no priming, no pulling the a starter, possibly multiple times, and no flooding. It just turned on and I was ready to go.Next thing I noticed was how light it really is. Coming off the weight of a heavy, self-propelled (weakly), all metal mower going to this largely plastic one was a gift. I didn't even notice it wasn't self-propelled. My initial thought was that it could easily have been built by Fisher-Price since it reminded me of my son's toy from so many years ago. Pushing it around is very easy.This thing is super quiet. Even more fun, it sounds like a bumblebee compared to the gas powered monstrosity I had previously. I even had a neighbor approach me after a mowing once with concerns that I was &#34;losing it&#34; thinking that, with my headphones on, I was pushing around a mower that wasn't running. I confirmed my sanity and explained the battery powered mower really does save your hearing.ConsI saw several references to uneven cuts and I would have to agree. Although some speculate that it is because the blades don't overlap, I think it is because of the mostly solid bottom of the deck. Most unevenness I found has been when dealing with dandelions that are so much longer than the rest of the grass. They tend to be missed if off to the side or dead center. There will also be some missed blades of grass on each pass, but I'm not meticulous about my lawn so it isn't an issue.There are quirks, too. I had the mower quit twice when it transitioned between batteries (the control circuitry uses one battery then switches when it runs out). Granted, it was early on and since then, I have only had it slow some, then kick in with the second battery.I also noticed that it adjusts the blade speed when the grass gets thicker. This is a great idea to maintain an even cut, except there is a time lag when you hit a change in the lawn. I have started working the system so that when I hit thicker lawn, I slow a little while the motor controller spools up the rpm's to handle the load. Minor issue, but the alternative is to have a machine that is psychic.The amount of time off full charge is a little less than advertised. It could be a smooth, even lawn that it was tested on so my irregular lawn might be what cuts the time down. I don't have a huge lawn, but it takes multiple sessions to mow it. Inconvenient, but I also don't get tired. If the weather cooperates, I get it done all in one day. Other times, it takes a couple.Overall, I am quite happy with this mower. I wish it had (2) 4 AHr  batteries instead of (1) 4 AHr and (1) 2 AHr. I also wish the motor controller was more responsive to changes in lawn resistance and better at the transition between batteries.None of this would prevent me from buying it again.",1405123200,2014-07-12

5.0,"So, I thought after fiddling with offset grills and barrel grills, it's time to try a kettle grill after all the hoopla from the UPS driver delivering all my other toys.  Well folks, it's worth it.  I had to get a covered grill that wasn't as big as my car for the front porch, after all the hollering by neighbors who saw the smoke billowing from my hibachi.  After all the charcoal experimenting with my barrel grill and its cousins and a Bodum  Fyrkat, I figured, what's new?  Well, a whole lot.  While related to the Bodum, the Weber is a whole lot more versatile, and can, if you wish create a range of flavors and textures.  While the one-touch system was touted as a handy cleaning device, where it really excells is as a controllable oxygen source.  Couple that nicety with movement of the 4-hole vent in the lid and  you control both the intensity of the heated charcoals with directionality.  When you're using indirect heat, the control of the temps lay with the oxygen adjustment, whilst the direction of the heat can determine the moistness as well as the degree of charring of the food.  The heavy steel as well as the brilliantly designed cooking grate that facilitates access to the coals make for a fun time at the cookery.  The Weber is iconic; it deserves that status.",1352764800,2012-11-13

They make a weekend out of it, trimming the bushes and trees and then parlaying stories of how hard the tasks were since they had to accomplish all the tasks using cutting shears and saws. This year, aided byBlack & Decker NHT524 24-Volt 24-Inch Cordless Electric Dual-Action Hedge Trimmerthe task of cutting all the bushes and several two-story trees in about 20 minutes. The hedges were trimmed neatly, as if someone drew a line and used a laser to point the trimmer. The effort spent on the cutting of the trees and the bushes was minimal at best.The tool has the following pros: it's easy to use; comes with several safety features - you must press each button separately in order to operate the machinery and there is a case for the blade of the trimmer that's useful for storage; it trims hedges in a very straight, perfect line; the battery has a long life - it was adequate for the cutting and trimming of all the hedges and tall bushes around a single-family house. Additionally, the box in which it arrived from amazon had the trimmer packaged neatly, with plenty of careful packaging to assure safe delivery and safety upon opening.The cons are minimal. The trimmer should be handled with both hands for optimal results in trimming the hedges straight. The battery is long-lasting but makes the trimmer heavy for a small woman to handle.The most important negative aspect of the trimmer is also the best positive aspect of the item, with the jobs of trimming the hedges, your dad will want to play with this toy but will inevitably be unable to do so as it will cut the trimming time to less than half an hour.",1274140800,2010-05-18
1.0,"The large, surprisingly lightweight box arrived in perfect condition, no visible damage inside or out.When I removed the head unit from the box however, I heard obvious broken parts inside and immediately called their customer support.After all, inside the box was a large STOP; call our dedicated, superior customer support for any trouble. I assumed this would be quickly taken care of since the self report their customer service to be so good.While they answered the phone quickly the quality of support was poor.I had an obviously defective unit with broken pieces inside and they wouldn't help unless I tried to turn it on first. This seemed like a bad idea for a product that hooks up to a fuel source. They wanted me to believe that the sound (broken pieces rattling and rolling around inside the head unit) I heard was normal.I could forgive this, after all they don't want to pay return shipping for an item that was misdiagnosed by a end user that doesn't have product experience. So I removed a cover piece and poured out the broken pieces, sent a photo to them in email, and was again refused support. They suggested  try turning the unit on and see if it worked, and then sent me to follow up with Amazon for the defective unit.The plastic pieces appear to be part of an internal frame, cage, or some other support. It is a strong, but brittle, black plastic. In addition to 4 large pieces, many small shattered fragments came out of the box. While the piece that was broken may not be critical, the question remains why it broke, and what else may be loose or disconnected. Am I going to end up with an internal propane leak that ends up causing the unit to catch on fire?As if this isn't enough to point to poor design/build quality, the unit is entirely made of lightweight plastic. The instructions even warn not to move the unit with a tank installed. I agree with their apparent admission that the frame would not support the weight! Perhaps an aluminum post that securely connected to the base and the head unit would be a good upgrade for them to consider.While the nearly all plastic construction was quick and easy to set up, there are no screws, no locks, nothing to hold the base, post, and head unit together. The head unit balances on the post with a short peg sliding into the support column. So the loop that looks like a handle opposite of the wheels on the base doesn't really work well for lifting and rolling the unit around. First as described above, you must remove the tank, even with that weight removed, the head unit tends to lift right off the post as it is a friction only connection.Chances are some of these units will actually work, some perhaps for more than the few weeks described by other reviewers, and perhaps if this unit was under $200 I could understand the build quality. But at this price point and nearly every review pointing out poor quality and poor customer service,  I would not recommend this unit to anyone and would be very concerned about any of their other lower cost units.The only positive note I can add for the Mosquito Magnet brand is that we have had an older design Commercial Unit Mosquito Magnet Pro in service for years.

5.0,"We have several hummingbird feeders in our yard and are always on the lookout for another one to add to help provide multiple areas for the birds to go which helps cut down on the territorial behavior enough to allow more than one bird to use the feeders (too many to defend).  We saw this feeder and thought that we would give it a try.  Here is what we liked:1.  This feeder is VERY easy to clean and to fill!!  Some feeders are so small that it is difficult to get a brush up into them to keep them clean.  This is very important since a sugar solution in sunlight and heat spoils quickly and can make the birds sick.2.  The color definitely attracts them.  There is NO need to use colored solution and it is actually better not to since the dye is not good for the birds.  The bright color of the feeder itself is enough to attract hummingbirds.3.  If you have problems with bees or ants, this feeder us setup to help you keep them at bay.  The clever trap for ants at the top and the bee guards do a very nice job!!4.  This feeder holds just enough food to be able to supply a large number of birds before you would need to clean it out anyway.  We found that if we fill it about 2/3 full, it was enough for the birds to go through most of it before it was time to clean it out.  Depending upon the amount of sun and heat, it takes 3 to 6 days for the liquid to start to cloud up and to require replacement.  ALWAYS clean your feeder when you change food!!Things that we did not like as much:1.  The perch is sort of a pain to keep aligned.  It is really necessary, probably not, but the birds will take advantage of it if it is there.All in all, this is very well made product that works as it should.  One quick note, any feeder will leak if it is in high winds!!!  When the winds were less than 12 mph we did not find any issue with leakage.",1399334400,2014-05-06
3.0,"The overall concept of this product is great - a fan housed in an 8-inch section of duct work that helps boost the airflow to a far room that doesn't get enough heat/cooling. However, in actual practice, it's not very convenient to use.The fan moves a lot of air - very powerful motor. The build quality of the unit appears quite good. It feels solid, and the attached power cord is stout.It is a bit on the noisy side, especially if there's a bit of duct work rattle. Not horrible, but don't expect whisper-quiet running. You will clearly hear this fan when it's operating.My biggest problem is the lack of an auto switch that turns the fan on/off only when there is air movement in the duct work. This is strictly a manul operation - plug it in and it turns on; unplug to turn off. While having a switch that senses air flow in the duct would obviously add to the cost, it would make this a far more practical product for duct work boosting.I found that it's better suited to on-demand venting. I added some inexpensive flexible duct to it and use it for venting the kitchen when I'm grilling indoors or roasting coffee beans (both of which can be smelly/smoky tasks).

The only downside is that they are very sticky and have open tops.

My goal is to educate people as to the best and least wasteful methods of capture.Don't buy bags, that's just silly....  capture and compost or recycle the beetles by giving them to chickens or other birds (kill them in soapy water first).This is hands down, the most effective method of attracting and capturing Japanese Beetles.Some will say that drawing beetles to a trap, also brings them to your yard/property from other yards?  This may be true, however, you are indeed removing them from the breeding cycle and over years to come, if you are consistent, the numbers will be reduced greatly.Without these traps, I would have lost all of my plumb trees to defoliating beetles.The only thing you have to replace with this system is the bait.

They're very easy to set and do a quick and efficient job of killing any rodents lurking in my attic.Update April 2012: Still using this trap and getting results, and I've also started re-using the trap, which is pretty easy to do and not as messy as you might think. I've started laying out multiple types of traps to test the effectiveness of them, and noticed that the rats don't always go for the Ortho any more, and I think have become accustomed to it.",1303344000,2011-04-21
5.0,"I have a half dozen Streptocarpus plants, which are flowering houseplants.  I got them from a lady at a farmers market awhile back, and the soil mix that she had used was full of perlite, making it very light.  Strepto culture is about the same as for African Violets, so I purchased some bagged soil mix for violets [without added plant food].  It was somewhat dense, however, and I lost a couple of my smaller streptocarpus plants.  I have since started adding about 20 to 25% Miracle Gro perlite to the mix.  The soil in my pots is light and porous, and so far, my Streps are loving it.  Since the Miracle Gro Perlite contains fertilizer, I do not add any additional plant food.  The doctored soil mix is now very much like what was used in the original plantings that I bought.  I also have a few African Violets, so I think I will repot those with the new mixture very soon.  I recommend this product highly.",1395964800,2014-03-28
4.0,"I have had this feeder about 6 weeks now and made several observations:1. It is well made, sturdy, tough, all metal zinc plated steel and will likely be very durable.2. Large capacity - holds 2.5 pounds black oil sunflower seeds requiring fewer refills.3. Easy to refill through large door on the top, without taking the feeder down.4. Cover or roof on top offers some protection from the rain (if it's not blowing).5. So far, not getting as much attention or use from the birds as my other feeders  but of course the birds are accustomed to the older feeders.6. Some reviewers complain the openings in the mesh are too small and birds can't get the seed out.  I am undecided about this but I doubt it is the case because if you shake the feeder some seed will fall out and through the mesh onto the platform.  I can say for sure there is less waste due to spillage of sunflower seeds compared to my other feeders- a big plus.7. I only wish it was available in a selection of colors.  I would prefer a more natural less gaudy color such as dark green, brown or black.  For me, the show is not the feeder, the show is the birds.",1402012800,2014-06-06

I gave this Leaf Shine spray a try on some potted indoor plants that had a light layer of dust.  Got a slightly shinier surface (wax?) than just misting with water.

4.0,"I've never owned a tiller before, and I've been reluctant to get one because I don't have the strength to start a gas mower, much less a tiller. So this electric tiller is a fine, fine thing for me. It is definitely a heavy-duty, production-grade tiller, not some wimpy little maybe-you-can-edge-with-it tool. But, lordy, I had a time of putting it together! (This review is more about me than it is about the tiller, by the way. I don't blame the tiller for my problems with it, but in case you might be like me, an older/weaker gardener, this might be helpful to you.)I have arthritis, for one, so assembling this tiller was painful. Also, not being mechanically inclined, I found the directions pretty unhelpful. You can see how parts fit together, sort of, but there is nothing that tells you what they are actually supposed to do or how the tiller is supposed to work. You are supposed to be able to intuit, I guess, how to use it. (Drag bar assembly? Best I can tell it's to keep the tines from sitting on the floor when you store it.)I borrowed the called-for wrench (actually, two of them because I found I needed a smaller one) and found it very difficult to screw the carriage bolt nuts because of the tight little space and the angle I had to work at. I followed the diagram and put the carriage bolts with the heads facing outward, and then it was nearly impossible to turn them. And I just could not figure out the deal with the washers and the wheels. I guess there was supposed to be a good bit of play; the wheels slide back and forth on the axle and the washers rattle loosely, but the nuts would not tighten any further. Even DH said it looked like there was more play than there ought to be but he didn't see how one is expected to tighten into the recessed wheel well using the wrench they say to use. But it all seems to work okay, so I guess we're good on that&mdash;until the wheels fly off. I've got my fingers crossed that won't happen.Adjusting the handle height with the pull-up mechanism was also difficult for me to do, but I managed to do it. The next problem I had was with removing the battery. I had to have help. I could not just grab it and pull it out; I didn't have the strength. Fortunately, you can charge the tiller with the battery still in place, but to cut down on the weight of the tiller when transporting it you have to be able to take the battery out. If you are a batty little old lady whose DH grumbles when asked to help with garden chores, keep this in mind.But, oh, this tiller is such a beautiful sight to behold when it gets down to doing its business! And it doesn't reek of gasoline. I'm glad I read another reviewer's suggestion of oiling the tines to help keep them clean.",1339200000,2012-06-09
5.0,"I got a set of these and I love them. I use them on 2 indoor plants, and am considering ordering a set for the office. I have quite a lot of plants, and I do have a tendency to give some of them too much love and overwater. These seem to have fixed the problem - I fill them, then don't have to worry about watering those plants at all until the globe is empty. I found that for my 2 plants (in smallish pots - probably 6in diameter or so, one pothos and one arrowhead vine), the globe lasts about 2 weeks. Plants are very happy - not too dry or too wet.Tip - when you go to refill, sometimes there is dirt stuck in the tip of the tube that just won't shake out, stopping you from filling it. Poke out the dirt with a paperclip or old cake tester and you're fine. Also it takes less time to fill if you do have the water on verrrrry slowly so it doesn't overkill the small tube.Seems the consensus on colors from where I've seen them is that they are both mostly blue, but one has just white specks and the other has multicolor specks (both very pretty).Note - I don't know that I'd use these outside. I don't think they're large enough to water an outdoor plant effectively in the heat, and I'd worry about the sun pinpointing through the glass and overheating in a magnifying glass effect (I'm probably just paranoid! The glass isn't smooth, so it's pro be ok - or use in a shady spot).",1233705600,2009-02-04

4.0,I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery.

5.0,"This is a big step up from myBlack & Decker TR116 3-Amp Hedge Trimmer, 16-Inch. I needed a pole trimmer because I have a handful of tall bushes that require me to break out a 16' ladder to trim them, and those are wide enough around that I have to move the ladder at least three times to get all around the shrub. I thought a pole handled trimmer would at least get me down to one or two moves, plus possibly a smaller ladder. As I've gotten older (and weaker), I had safety in mind as a main factor.The trimmer itself is a very nice trimmer. It cuts cleanly and quickly. I started out by getting the feel for the tool with my feet on the ground, trimming the shorter shrubs around my tall ones using the trimmer without the pole. I encountered no problems. Then, as planned, I attached the pole and broke out the 10' ladder. I quickly realized I had to be very careful handling the trimmer with the pole, especially with the pole extended, and doubly especially when on the ladder with extended pole. The weight at the far end is difficult to handle, and even with the rubber grip in the middle of the pole, (which, by the way, is located perfectly for maximum leverage), when the vibration of the blade starts, control becomes difficult. As I continued to get the hang of it, I expanded my range, but I had to be careful to always have two feet securely on the ground or ladder and two hands on the pole to not lose my grip and fall. Still, I consider being able to use the shorter ladder and the hard shoulder and arm workout an improvement over moving everything around, climbing up and down multiple times, and hauling the 16' ladder back and forth through my flowerbed. At least, it was saving me some time, if not energy. Then, I made another discovery.With the trimmer on the pole and the ladder put away, I trimmed the few remaining shrubs. Hey! The trimmer with the pole, shortened to its minimum length, makes easy work of the ground height shrubs, right down to the surface of the flowerbed! I didn't have to bend or strain my back, or twist my neck to see the contours of the bush, and I could brace my arms against my body and reach the whole shrub from one location. Having the extra length meant I could just stand back and wield the trimmer and let it do its job. The energy I expended carrying and using it and the pole on the high bushes was saved many times over on the short bushes. I would estimate that the use of the pole on the trimmer saved me about thirty minutes over a two hour job. The reduction of wear and tear on my body was incalculable. When I was finished, my bushes looked great and were ready for Christmas lights, which my body still had enough energy to dig out and slap onto the bushes. It made me happy.I won't go so far as to say I'm looking forward to having to cut the bushes in the spring, but I am sort of curious to see how much time and energy this pole trimmer saves me when I have to do the more substantial spring trimming (more and different kinds of bushes). This is not a perfect solution for everybody, as the pole really takes a certain amount of strength and some getting used to, but for the average user with typical trimming needs, I think this thing, even at its extremes of length and heaviness, still makes most jobs easier to do than with available alternatives. I love this pole trimmer and my back said to give it a five star rating, so, I did!",1389398400,2014-01-11
4.0,"I heard about this product on a DIY talk show that I listen to on the weekends.  It sounds too good to be true, but I'd hate to miss out on a possible good product! :)The pros:+ 1 gallon concentrate makes 6 gallons of ready to use product.

4.0,"Anybody attempting to do their own exterminating with only one product is like a plumber trying to do his job with only one tool: a screwdriver.There are at least a dozen different types of ants in most regions and some require different types of treatments. There are sugar ants and protein ants each requires a different bait.  Many ants march in trails 50 to 60 feet from their mound or bed.One year, I sprayed ant trails all summer long and couldn't find the bed. That fall, I moved a whiskey barrel planter located 60 feet from the house and discovered a huge bed underneath.I've been doing my own exterminating for 30 years. It took me 10 years to get it right.Professional exterminators will tell you that DIY methods are ineffective. That's not true. It can be done. Granted, licensed exterminators have access to certain chemicals that homeowners do not. Even so, it is possible with the available chemicals if applied correctly.The most common way to see an ant die immediately is to stomp it or spray it with poison. While you are stomping or searching for a can of spray, the queen has laid a dozen more eggs.We live on a heavily-wood hilltop in the middle of 10 acres surrounded by pastures where fire ants and many other kinds of ants thrive. There are many kinds of invading ants and they have different diets, characteristics and preferred environments.Save yourself a bundle of money. Over the past 30 years, I've saved $21,000.00 based on a savings of $700.00 a year less than the professional companies charge my friends and relatives for a termite contract.In the foundation holes of my house, I use plain boric acid powder available at most dollar stores. The 2-pound squeeze bottle is what I use. It's cost about $4.00. It is cheap and effective. Cut the top off the spot and generously squeeze it in. It lasts for years killing ants, roaches and other invading insects.Most white power advertised as ant and roach power is nothing more than plain boric acid.Around the outside of the foundation, I apply Ortho Home Defense Max Termite and Destructive Bug Killer double strength at 3 ounces per gallon instead of the 1.5 recommended. Initially, I did this 2 years in a row. This is a liquid concentrate formula. 32 ounces makes 10.6 gallons of double strength mixture, costs about $40.00 and lasts up to 5 years. I apply every 3 years.The EPA banned Chlorodane in 1988. Chlorodane was effective for 35 years. Since 1988, Ortho Home Defense Max Termite and Destructive Bug Killer is the best termite protection the unlicensed consumer can buy.Once a year, with a spreader, I apply a granular, broad spectrum insect killer in a 50-foot perimeter around the house that has 3-month control and does not have to be watered in.For treating a small perimeter or spot treating, Terro 901 Ant Killer Plus does work well but it must be watered in after treatment and the correct amount applied. The effective life is only 8 weeks.  The shaker bag makes spot treating easy but dragging a water hose or water can around is the hard part.The next step is where the Terro Bait comes in. I've used Terro Bait for several years as my choice of bait for sugar ants. It works. The problem is that ant's taste buds change with the seasons.  I've heard people say, ""The bait is no longer working.""  The solution is simple.  Offer a choice of baits that attracts both sugar and protein ants. I don't want to attract ants near my home. I want to kill them before they get near. I place the bait beyond the perimeter of the granular poison. When the ants halt their march at the perimeter, I offer them a picnic until they decide where to go next. They will crawl all over the bait for about 2 weeks. That's about how long it takes for the workers to get the boric acid into the mound and feed the queen her last supper.My personal recipe for sugar ants in large quantities is 3 cups of sugar, 2 ounces of honey, 4 cups of boiling water and 1 ounce of boric acid.  Stir until mixture has completely dissolved and allow to cool. This mixture will also eliminate any yellow jacket problem.For protein ants, I use creamy peanut butter instead of sugar.WARNING: Please be careful to place liquid baits where no birds or animals can get to your trap. I cover mine with 1/2"" mesh hardware cloth weighted with a rock or brick on top.  Place where rain water will not weaken formula and sun will not quickly evaporate.Check out what an exterminator charges for a contract and know that you can do it yourself for 25% of the quote...and in most cases...get far better results.Check out what exterminators charge for burying those little ""green"" plastic traps all around a house and monitoring them every month. I've known more than one homeowner protected by this ""environment friendly"" method to suffer termite damage. Granted, the contract requires the exterminating company to make the repairs. Yet still, there's all the turmoil of the construction workers, the mess and inconvenience to deal with. I've seen this happen a few times. It's a pain.Some homeowners have their exterminator visit twice a month during the warm months. They have to keep coming back because they only spray where the homeowner tells them to spray.If the job was done right the first time, they'd only have to make one trip a year...but the exterminators wouldn't make nearly as much money either.Don't take the bait unless you don't have a choice.",1369008000,2013-05-20

4.0,"UPDATE - OVER ONE YEAR LATER:  Gosh, time flies.  Weather has been strange in our area, which is on a major migration path for many, many birds.  And the migration patterns have adjusted to accommodate the weather differences and fluctuations.  So, we've not seen the huge amount of hummers that we have in past years.  But I'd like to report that these feeders are still looking good and working well after a solid year of use.  We have kept one of the feeders up year-round because we've got a few little guys that toughed it out again through this past winter and stayed with us.Original review follows:I wanted new hummingbird feeders for the upcoming Spring migration.  Our old ones are just too hard to clean, and after several season's use they actually won't come clean anymore.  I heard good things about this shape of feeder.So far, so good.  We have a few hummers that have stayed with us through the very mild winter (we're an hour below Houston) and they have been drinking out of one of our old feeders that is hanging under a pecan tree outside the kitchen window.  I hung one of the these new feeders in the same tree.  Within a week the hummers have changed over to the new feeder.We have a lot of wind in our area and there is a lot of sway in the lower branches of the pecan tree.  This feeder has a reservoir in the center that can catch sugar water as it sloshes back and forth in the wind.  The holes are on the top of the feeder and not on the side, so they don't drip.  The picture is a bit deceiving in that there is no color in the ""flowers"" around the holes.  In the picture on this product page, it is just the sun's reflection on the raised ""flower"" that you are seeing.The lid just pops off and there are no little indents or hard to clean ins and outs.  It is very easy to clean.The little hummers seem to like to be able to perch on the little railing.  They will perch there for several minutes at a time (which of course will all change when the population increases in a few weeks...)  With all the wind we have, it sure seems like the perch makes it easier for them to sip.The hanger is included.  It is very sturdy and screws in to a metal female part buried in the plastic.  The feeder holds 12 ounces and there is a measurement guide in the clear plastic on the side.I knocked it down one star because the lid just pops on, making me afraid that I'll push it down too far and crack the plastic.  Also, it seems a little pricey for what it is.  But, hey, it will be easier to clean (times four), and--in my world--time is money.",1332460800,2012-03-23

It is nice to start a fire sometimes in the evening, without having to go to the trouble to start a fire in our giant fire pit.

3.0,"I wanted to use this Havahart Spray Away Elite II Motion Detector Sprinkler Animal Repeller for one reason... to keep free-roaming cats away from my bird feeders and squirrels, while at the same time not frightening off my birds and squirrels!From a behavior perspective, the device has a lot going for it.  It provides a sudden, negative sound, visual, and tactile experience for an animal.  The theory of effective animal harassment encourages multiple, unpredictable negative sensory experiences to provoke fear and reduce the onset of habituation.  So the spray of water (tactile, and certainly unpleasant for cats), and the sight and sound of the water, along with the fact that the spray doesn't occur at regular, pulsed intervals, should help in the effectiveness of this device.  And I like that it isn't connected to a hose, and is solar powered.Unfortunately, I am having difficulty in getting the sensors to work for smaller animals like cats.

When a squirrel attempts to grip or jump on the feeder its weight automatically pulls the metal part down, closing off access to the bird food.  It is 100% foolproof.On the downside, I have read reports of small birds having their heads guillotined if they are feeding when a heavy bird or squirrel lands on the feeder.  I have never seen that happen, but I did at one time find the head of a small bird near the feeder.  That possibility really unnerved me.  Right now I have my feeder set to be as unresponsive as possible to weight, so that only a squirrel will close it (so it does not close for woodpeckers, starlings, etc.).  I also have it mounted in such a way that squirrels are unlikely to be able to reach it.  I am comfortable using the feeder with those caveats, but I do think the rapid closure and deep feeding holes could create a dangerous situation for small birds.",1361923200,2013-02-27

4.0,"I have had this product for about a month now and so far, I've caught 3 chipmunks. However, it's worth noting that more often than not (until my modification), the trap was closed, treat was gone and no chipmunks were inside. Though the bait tray is sensitive, a chipmunk can easily get a treat off it and walk out of the trap without it being deployed. Happened to me several times. One time I set the trap on some mulch and the chipmunk dug at the treat from below, again evading the trap.The tip someone posted about smearing peanut butter on the bait tray itself is a good one. However, it's messy and if left out too long, will attract ants. What I did was take a clamp I used for my pet birds and secure it to the inside of the trap near the bait tray. I clip a little graham cracker with some peanut butter on it - that way, the chipmunk almost has to step on the bait tray and/or struggle a little to get the treat, therefor triggering the trap. He can't just grab the treat and go, he has to either sit there for awhile eating it, or pull it off the clamp, either way increasing the likelihood that the trap will deploy.For the price, I feel this is a good product, though I really wish there was a way to secure the treat to the bait tray. It would definitely increase the chances of catching a chipmunk. Setting it up is fairly easy, though not totally intuitive in setting the trap itself. Nice thing is reusable, portable and not messy.Oh, and I doubt a squirrel could fit into this thing! It does seem big enough to catch a squirrel.Overall, a good value for those of us who don't yet have the nerve to kill the little buggers. ;)",1248652800,2009-07-27

5.0,"Prior to getting this from Amazon I'd gotten one before at Home Depot... the one Amazon sent me included batteries and peanut butter bait, which I wasn't expecting and was pleasantly surprised to see. These traps are designed to electrocute any heat emitting life-form that comes in after the bait. It's for indoor use and you need to be sure no pet you own could get to it. The size of the trap is ideal for rats, not too wide yet not too narrow for larger rats to get in. There's an indicator light that blinks once when you turn the trap on and which will have a sustained blink after the trap has been set off by something.There are times when my telepathic directives for rats to stay out of my home get ignored [and occasionally a rat will get through an entry point that can't be covered], and when that's occured I've tried a few different types of traps. The glue traps didn't work well as strong resourceful rats can break free of them and the glue loses effectiveness over time. Spring traps work better but they can miss their mark sometimes and they leave a messy sight when they do kill a rat. This electric trap has worked fine when used as directed and the bloodless dead rats are easy to dispose of. I also believe this is a more humane way to eliminate rats than other common trap designs or using rat poison bait.",1301702400,2011-04-02
4.0,"I've had mine since December 2010 and for grilling it is outstanding!  Obvious pro's are the wonderful grill marks it produces on steaks and burgers (see my pic of a tritip I made recently).  The grill grates are easy to clean and maintain.  They are easy to reseason and are completely non stick.  I just made some scallops over the weekend and they didn't stick at all to the bars.  Burgers, steaks, chicken fish - you name it; all cook and look great using this cast iron surface.The only con is that this unit is heavy and a pain to take off and put back on. I remove mine when I add coals from the chimney starter since I don't want a bunch of ash dust all over the grates.  You can remove the four sections independently, add the charcoal and put them all back on, but I find it easier to take one of the sections out and remove the entire unit.  That way the cross section bars stay ash free as well.  Also, I tend to use my Weber rotisserie a lot; about once a week and removing, storing and putting the grill grate back in place can be a pia as compared to the standard, light, one piece Weber grill grate.  I still love the way this grill grate cooks and wouldn't switch back to the stock item, but just know that you need a decent set of biceps, good thick gloves and a place to store this thing when moving it around.It's a minor inconvenience to getting superior grill marks on your steaks.  Enjoy!",1334534400,2012-04-16
4.0,"When I got a chance to review this product, I had read that an Android app would be available in January 2014. When I went to the Parrot website, however, they could only provide a signup to be notified when the Android version is available ""sometime in the first half of 2014."" I'll have to update my actual experience with the monitor itself after the free Android app comes out. For those who already have Apple products, there's a free app that allows you to access the online plant database to monitor the needs of various types of plants and also read the sensor.This review is going to deal with my initial impressions only. First, I've used the early Easy Bloom product, which requires you to physically dump data onto your computer via a USB plug-in thingie. The Flower Power monitors more than the Easy Bloom (fertilizer needs!) and is wireless to boot. I didn't like how the Easy Bloom app was always ""on,"" hogging resources; I'm hoping the Flower Power will be different.Both products depend on accessing data from a web site, but I found Parrot's database to be a lot more accessible. Even without the app or the product hooked up, I was able to check out the database and will use it to help me plan what I plant this spring when, hopefully, I'll have the Android app. First, there's an A-to-Z sorter at the top of the page, and there are also great filters: Type (Grass, Interior Plants, Shrubs, Trees, Vines, Edibles), Shape/Habit, Bloom Color, Leaf Color, Lifetime (Annual, Biennial, Perennial), and Bloom Season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). A search box not only finds what you look for, it tells you how many instances it found. So, for ""cucumbers,"" I got 33 varieties/hits; ""bush bean,"" 25 hits; ""bean,"" 68 hits, including bush beans, lima beans, regular old beans, plus anything that has ""bean"" in the common name, like Jacobean lily, Castor bean, Lucky bean tree, and Caribbean Red (pepper).Without the app, you can go to parrot/flowerpower and peruse the database to see how it's laid out. I found it very accessible and appealing, with its clear layout and wonderful photos, and it includes very helpful planting and plant care info, both hardiness and heat zones, even interesting facts about the plants&mdash;all in a very enjoyable-to-explore format. However, I realized quickly that the database is all in metric&mdash;which is Greek to most U.S. residents like me. (I left them a suggestion that they might want to at least put in a converter for those of us who just won't get with the metric program.)I'm really looking forward to planting tomatoes in my new Tomato Success Kits, which I can roll out into the sun in front of my apartment (the back's too shady), and I was at first delighted to see all the varieties (114 search hits!) of tomatoes (with great photos) in the database. But one problem immediately presented itself: the database does not include the super-essential (for container gardeners) indeterminate vs. determinate info for the tomatoes, so more research will be required once you've narrowed down your choices. I didn't spend a lot of time in the database looking at other edibles I might plant, but those who have specific veggies or fruits they wish to plant need to check them out to be sure the information they need is included. Of course, I'm sure the monitor itself could care less if a tomato is determinate or indeterminate. It's going to base its information on how much light, water, and fertilizer is there for the plant and also the temperature. It's up to container gardeners to figure out what's going to work in a planting.On the whole, so far I'm really impressed and hope that Android app is out in time for me to use the Flower Power this spring.",1389139200,2014-01-08
4.0,"The Havahart 1083 one door cage trap is designed to be easy to set and easy to release trapped animals as well. For the range of animals it's designed for it seems slightly small, which means you need to be pretty deliberate about how you set up the bait and position the trap to make sure it gets triggered and traps the animal. Once you do have the animal caught it's easy to carry the trap to an appropriate destination and release your catch. This trap is a suitable size for the squirrels in my area, and it can even be used for small cats/kittens. Since I've had it there haven't been any new instances of rodents tearing screening around the patio at my home. Now that mango season is passed for my tree I will have to see how avocado season goes when the fruits mature this fall - will the squirrels make it to the trap instead of the tree? So far so good, but when those fruits are ripe you really need a good bait for the trap to compete with your produce.It is important to know in advance how/where you can release animals in your vicinity, since you don't know which animal may end up in your trap. Also, read the suggestions given about food baits to use - if you want the best chance of trapping what you wish to trap it helps to have their favorite food, or at least something they like that's not too expensive. This trap is pretty functional, learning how to maximize its effectiveness will bring greater success and satisfaction. This may combine with your satisfaction of dealing kindly with small animals that are a nuisance to your property. If that is your goal then this trap is certainly worth having.",1342569600,2012-07-18

I washed everything, sprayed the wall with ant spray, and put the feeder and trap back up this time with the moat full of water.  No ants.

I've always hated the cruel nature of snap traps, glue traps and pMy first electronic trap was a much earlier model of Rat Zapper and this is now my third one. The other two are still working great even after years of use, I just wanted to cover another area.For those that aren't familiar with electronic traps, they work by sensing when a mouse or rat has entered the chamber and firing a very strong current through the floor plates which instantly incapacitates and kills the vermin. I'd prefer a teleportation device so they all end up in Siberia or North Korea, but since those are impossible, I'll settle for killing the critters humanely.The Rat Zappers seem to be the gold standard of electronic traps. They're well made, powerful, easy to bait and maintain and most importantly, they're easy to clean out afterwards.The trap has an jack to plug in an optional signal light so you can hide the trap out of view and place the signal light so you can see when a kill's been made.Pros:Very powerful and will kill rats as well as mice.Easy to clean out visitorsBatteries last for very many killsOptional indicator lightCons:Requires D Cell batteriesCost is higher than mouse-only trapsSomewhat hard to clean out if you leave a visitor in the trap too long (yeah, I know.

3.0,"The concept behind this trap is a good one. In essence you'll never have to see or touch the dead mouse, which is a big plus. Unfortunately, the trap is flawed in that it has a hit-or-miss success rate. While easy to load and set, it's apparently not very sensitive as the mouse was able to get the peanut butter a few times before I gave up on the trap and went another route. I set it as instructed and gave it room to work, but it never seemed to go off while the peanut butter kept disappearing. It's a very large trap for its purpose, which makes it a little inconvenient to set out as well. It's not easy to put this next to a wall without it sticking out about five inches into the hallway.I'll give it points because it would probably work for a larger mouse and maybe mine is just too small for it to catch, but it needs work.

So I had the opportunity to try out the GreenView spreader, which is battery powered (and to share my disclaimer, I was able to try the product for free, but I have zero incentive to provide anything but an honest review).I opened up the package, figured out how to slide the bottom part, and opened up the tab that sealed off the fertilizer.  Note that it does come with a full load, but you can easily refill the container.  I spent a minute or two trying to get it to work, and no luck.  Found out that one of the batteries was in crooked; once I fixed that, I was up and running!It is just plain fun AND easy to use this thing.  Just pull out the yellow tab on the bottom, and a little motor whirs to life, doing a very nice and even spread.  Just walk around and watch the fertilizer fly.  I was able to apply fertilizer to my lawn (average suburban size) in about 5 minutes.  This happens to be quicker than pulling out my giant green Scott's push-fertilizer (and much less messy).  And this product takes up less room than my old spreader; just sits on the garage shelf.  The battery life seems good.  It uses four plain old AA batteries, so in future years I'll just pop in some of my rechargeable batteries and will be good to go.The spread pattern was far more even than when my push spreader (or my small hand-cranked spreader) offers.  My old methods always seemed to have certain messy spots with too much fertilizer, and others without enough, but this makes the distribution quite even around the lawn.  The only very minor hiccup I encountered was when the spreader seemed to stop spreading, but I just had to give the handle one quick &#34;heft&#34; and the fertilizer flowed evenly after that.Bottom line, I figured I would be laughing at the product, but instead I will be laughing at the neighbors when I watch them making a mess with their giant push-spreaders.

2.0,"The design is such that pets and children would have to work to get at the poison.  However, the poison is Bromethalin.  One dose is lethal to rodents, and they die within 24 to 36 hours.  The downside to this is that they may go elsewhere and die, which may be someplace that you do not want a decomposing creature.A persistent dog could chew on this, and it is deadly to dogs (and even more so to cats, but they are less likely to be randomly chewing on plastic, at least from what I have observed!).  There is no antidote, so if you have a rambunctious dog, you might want to consider a snap trap (annoying to a dog, but not lethal).Now, does it work?  In my experience, nope.  I placed these traps along with an electronic trap, and a couple of snap traps along the wall in my garage where I KNOW mice run (we catch about a half dozen a week).  After 10 days I pried the station open (which is not recommended) to be sure the bait had been gnawed.  It had not.I think I would rather go back to my old fashioned snap traps (at least I know where the dead mice are) or my new fangled electrocution chamber (which also kills instantly).I did put it outside now (where if the mice die someplace else I do not have to smell them), and if I see that the bait is taken I will report back.

3.0,"We are always looking for ottomans.  Why is it that outdoor chairs and furniture sets don't come with them?  The fact that you can order this ottoman separately is a major plus.  Too bad though--after over a year of trying--the manufacturer still cannot attach the woven resin material evenly.  You know how it is when the stripes on a shirt/skirt/shorts are crooked?  Or when the lines don't match at the seam?  Well, my ottoman looks like it's tilted, but it isn't really.  It is the resin material that is applied on an angle and is heading off the bottom edge. Last year I ordered a cocktail table and an end table.  Both had the same problem:  The resin material was not lined up when attached to the frame.  It wouldn't be so bad if there was no color variation in the weave, but if you look closely at the picture you can see stripes--not severely contrasting stripes, but stripes all the same.  In my opinion, stripes need to line up:  On shirts or on furniture.NOTE:  I don't even need to post a picture of my own:  Just take a close look at the pictures posted on this product page.  Look at the front-on view and you can see the weave is angled.  It is more prominent when you stand a few feet away, and the tilt of the weave is even more prominent on my piece.  Highlight the close-up picture along the bottom edge and you can see where the weave runs off the edge.**UPDATE:  If you really want to buy this furniture, but are concerned about receiving a piece with the ""crooked look"", consider the darker color:  There is not so much difference in the weave color and you can't see stripes.**This ottoman is a nice height and is lightweight enough that anyone could move it around.  If you need a little extra storage space in the area when you use this furniture, the inside is hollow.The color of the resin weaving is identical to what was sold last season; so you can feel some confidence in a new piece matching one purchased last year.  The cushion is a neutral color and the material feels substantial.Regarding the cushion:  It is not attached at the base, so it slides around when you lift your feet up.  Also, there is no indication that the material is treated with Scotchguard.  We are going to spray the material with Scotchguard and apply some Velcro pieces.  It is a zippered cover, so I suppose it can be washed.The base is exactly like the tables, just a different size.  So, if you wanted to, you could remove the cushion and use it as a low table.  Like the tables, there is no support under the weave, but you can use it for very lightweight items (glasses, yes; not stemware).One last observation:  I got a table in this line last year that arrived with a broken leg and Amazon did not want it back.  We put it behind a storage shed in case Amazon changed its mind.  It has not gotten any use, but it has been out in the weather for a year now and the color and texture of the resin weave has not changed.",1361923200,2013-02-27

5.0,"Damn that is a good looking grill!  I went with the copper colored E-310 grill.  I had seen them in stores and they looked great.  I was very surprised to see how much better it looks in the sunshine.  That grill sparkles!  The copper color is actually a metallic copper that I did not notice in the stores, I was pleasantly surprised.I have owned many, many grills over the years, but never a Weber propane grill.  The other grills always lasted a few years, then the burners needed to be replaced, and they never worked the same again.  My last grill, a Kenmore, served me well for about 6 years.  I decided it was time to replace it because the hinges were rusted along with the propane slide out rack that rusted and did not move.  The stainless steel cover had stains on it.  Seriously?  Why exactly do they call it ""stainless"" steel if it can stain?  Then the door latches broke and I had to keep them closed with a bungee cord.  There is something about using bungee cords to keep doors closed that just struck me as very trashy looking, so it was time to upgrade.I have some experience with Webers, but never on the propane side.  I currently have two Weber charcoal grills, aWeber 751001 22.5-Inch One-Touch Goldand aWeber Performer Grill 1424001 Charcoal Grillwhich both perform well.  I also have two smokers, one homemade out of a 55 gallon drum, and I just finished building a wood fired pizza oven.  Yes, I know, its an addiction, but I love cooking in my yard. I have a few projects for this summer, I am building a firepit, and an outdoor fireplace off my deck.  The fireplace will have a Santa Maria type cooking surface integrated into it. I am also in the process of building a site dedicated to cookinginmyyard. Hopefully that will be up soon.  I only mention these things to add validity to my review.  I may not be the ultimate resource for grills, but I do think my experience counts.Now back to the grill.  Its a Weber, so you probably already know it is well made.  I think it is sturdy and well designed.  I went with the E-310 because I did not need side burners.  I found that I rarely used the side burners but I did need the side shelves, so why spend extra money for something I won't be using.  There is a sturdy feel to the grill, this is not a cheap knock-off grill.The cooking surface is cast iron and thick.  That means it will take a few minutes to heat up fully, but the thick cast iron transfers really nice grill marks onto my steaks.  Plus I do not think the cast iron will rust out too soon and need to be replaced.  The propane holder is actually a gas gauge too.  The tank hangs on a sliding mechanism and gives you a visual display of the tank contents.  That will come in handy because I have run out of gas a time or two in the past.  And it always happens on Sunday night when I cannot jump into the car to get the tank refilled.Why did I go with a Weber?  Because I am tired of replacing grills every so many years.  I plan on living a long time, and grilling very often on this grill, and I fully expect it to give me great service for many years to come.",1330300800,2012-02-27
5.0,"I've got three other feeders, one being very similar to this, but having a green glass bottle.  I use a solution of one part sugar to four parts boiled and cooled water and the hummingbirds prefer this feeder to the other ones I have.  I think it may be because this one has much more red color than the other three.  It's really easy to clean; the bottom part comes apart into two pieces so you can scrub the inside well and I use a toothbrush on the flowers.  The bottle stays clean with just a rinse every couple of days.  Sometimes I had a little salt and hot water and give it a good shake and rinse well.  If you let it go for a few days, you may need a bottle brush to clean the inside.",1340150400,2012-06-20
5.0,This is a really nice large hummingbird feeder so you don't have to fill as often.  I usually have 7 feeders going at one time.  It comes apart quickly and is easy to keep clean with a little brushing.  Has thin rim around so the little hummers can rest their claws while feeding.  Many birds feed at one time.  Even have a family of orioles that like it!  Makes my life easier.,1385337600,2013-11-25
4.0,"This is a very decorative bird feed tube set.It has two heavy-gauge glass tubes capped by copper feed trays. You can use each with seed (for example, you could do black oilseed for your cardinals and maybe a thistle mix for the finches) or you can do seed and water in the summer months.Some random comments:1. The decorative scroll bracket is very pretty, but if you live in a breezy area (we do) then you will want to tie the feeders onto the hooks with cable ties. I can see them swinging off in a stiff breeze, especially the top hook, which is meant to hang on a wall bracket or a yard stand. I would NOT trust this unit in a breezy area without some ""redesign"" using cable ties.2. In winter, fill both tubes with feed--water will freeze and break the glass.3. Birds are really more attracted to running water. While they will appreciate a sip from the tube, if you want more birds in the yard, find a fountain bird bath. At one point, we converted a terra cotta cascading fountain to a bird bath by putting it on a stand. The birds stood under the cascade and took showers. They LOVED it. A cascading fountain is nice in the garden and will attract more birds to your yard. I would probably not bother using the water side as water; I would use two kinds of seed: oil seed and thistle mix for example.The unit is packed extremely well--it was wrapped in bubble wrap and taped to keep the glass tube from breaking. It is attractive, fits my color scheme but beware the issues of durability where you hang it.",1306368000,2011-05-26

5.0,"I've never owned a hummingbird feeder before, but I found this Perky Pet Hummingbird Feeder very easy to use.  I just fill it with a 1:4 mixture of sugar and water and the hummingbirds come.  There are little vine perches next to each plastic flower.  Some people might not like that, because the birds end up resting on them to feed instead of hovering.  I think it's just as well to make life a little easier for the little guys.  They obviously prefer perching to hovering.The only difficulty I have is making sure all the screw on parts are tight.  It's easy to inadvertently loosen one piece while tightening another.  The push-pull feature makes it simple to fill and prevent spilling.  I haven't had any problems with leakage.Cleaning is a cinch.  It all comes apart so everything can be scrubbed inside and out.  The plastic doesn't rust and there is no glass to worry about.So far, so good.  I have this hanging off our fence but the ants and the bees haven't found it yet.  Even though it's plastic, it is attractive.  I think I'll go out and buy a shepherd's hook for it to show it off better.  It's a lovely little feeder._____________________UPDATE:  The ants finally found my feeder, and then they wouldn't leave it alone.  I boughtPerky Pet Ant Guardand now all is well.  The hummingbirds love my feeder and they are a joy to watch.______________________UPDATE:  I wanted a quick and easy way to wash the feeder (I'm lazy).  Just want to let you all know it doesn't melt in the dishwasher.  My hummingbird feeder sparkles.",1280966400,2010-08-05

3.0,"There is nothing all that fancy here and you pretty much get what you see.  This is a hunk of galvanized metal, cut, bent and welded into a very functional shape to hold your garden hose.  It is sturdier than you might think and it is truly functional; although not the prettiest thing in the world.  Whether it holds 100 feet of hose will depend a lot on what brand of hose you use.This is my second of these holders.  I use one for a hose I have to water the hosta beds in the back and I have another hanging in my shed to store electrical extension cords...both work and function as they are suppose to.  The one out in the elements has not rusted (yet) or bent despite being exposed to the rain and snow and despite the fact that the hose mounted on it is a rather heavy one.A couple of things to note:  First, these do not come with screws - you will have to provide your own.  When you decide on what screw to use I would strongly suggest you use it with a metal washer of some sort.  The weight of a hose, over time, could damage the mounting holes.  DON'T use nails as a friend of mind did with his...nails will not hold well enough.

5.0,"I opened the box to find a cart that wasn't likely to carry much more than a ""Town and Country"" children's riding wagon.I was hoping for something bigger. Oh well, I thought--this is probably all the garden wagon I can expect to get for under a hundred dollars.But I'm liking it more and more now that it's assembled and in use.As I unpacked it I realized the running gear--frame, wheels, tow bar--are very beefy. If the plastic tub ever splits or cracks to a point where I can't use it anymore, I'm sure I could build an even bigger tub out of plywood and reuse all the rest of the parts. In fact the wagon may be worth the purchase price just to get all those parts.Assembly was a bit difficult. It wasn't that it was complicated. It's just that many of the bolts had very shallow heads and very shallow standard screwdriver slots to match. I couldn't seem to find a screwdriver that would stay securely in the slots while I tightened the nuts. I wound up using the edge of a bricklaying trowel to hold some of them.Even with that little annoyance I had the cart together with tires inflated and ready to roll in under two hours.I use a 6-foot ratcheting tie-down strap to expand the wagon's load capacity. I stack branches and sticks in lengthwise in the wagon tub and pile them as high as I can. Then I wrap the strap around sticks, tub, and all, and tighten it down--just enough to snug the load.The wagon rides very well over our uneven property. And because of the long tow handle and steering front wheels it tracks extremely well behind our riding mower. It's like it's following on rails. It doesn't cut corners and run over things when making turns close to something.The swing-away handles on the tow bar are a real nice addition for those times when you'd rather pull the cart around by hand instead of hooking it to a mower or yard tractor. The cart's dumping feature works very well also.What I thought would be disappointing turned out to be something I'm very happy with. It may be a light duty wagon, but I'm certain I'll get a lot of use out of it.",1194307200,2007-11-06
5.0,"In our home and camp we have pets and do not want to have any sort of hazardous chemicals or traps in the house.  If you expecting immediate results, you are setting your bar too high.  At camp there was still evidence of small rodent activity for a week before we started to see results.  We had another similar device that lasted for several years and so far, so good with this one.  In an unattended camp, rodent activity can wreak havoc on things like insulation or wiring, to say nothing of unsanitary conditions.  For example, in our area we have red squirrels and they can be very destructive.According to the small enclosed brochure it states that ""Consumers repeatedly tell us that they have had great success using the PEST OFFense product to control rats, mice, and roaches  . . .  ants, spiders, squirrels, crickets, silverfish, waterbugs and earwigs.""  I can only vouch for the absence of mice and squirrels as those are the critters I don't care to have around and tend to be abundant in our area.For each level of your home you will need one of these devices.  For example, if you have a two-story building, you will have to purchase two of them.  The directions clearly state where to place each unit for maximum effectiveness.  If don't place your unit in a centrally located circuit on one floor I wouldn't be at all surprised if you have spiders or ants on the other end.  Now, one thing to seriously take note of  . . .Do NOT use or purchase this device if you have the following pets:HamstersGerbilsGuinea PigsMinksChinchillasTarantulasOr similar small petsI like this type of product because it is an environmentally sound method of eradicating or at least reducing pests in the home.

2.0,"UPDATED REVIEW: 9/29/13The hose popped in the center!!  What do they make these hoses out of these days!!!  The reason why I chose this one was because all the other hoses we had also popped.  They don't make hoses like they used to.  We took care of this hose to great lengths.  We would drain the hose and never leave water in it when we were done.  We'd disconnect from the faucet and put it away after each use.  It still popped!!!  You can read my original review when I got this hose, but now that it is of no use, I'm altering my review.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I was so frustrated that we bought a standard hose and then one day, it just popped and water sprayed out of the hose.  We had been looking to buy a replacement, but hoses are expensive and the one we had was the second hose we bought.Then came the Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose.  I'm glad I held off buying the standard hose.  I like this expanding hose for the following reasons:A) Very lightweightB) No need for a hose box you have to wind up to put the hose awayC) Comes with a carrying/storage caseD) Expands as the water runs throughE) Comes with a fitting to allow you to shut the water off at the end of the hose to change fittingsWhat I thought could've been better is:1) Water pressure was not as forceful as with the standard hose.  I think this is due to it's size2) Plastic fittings instead of metal3) Would not be easy to replace the fittings4) End that connects to the water faucet is hard to grab in order to tighten.  Water was coming out and I had to tighten moreOverall, it may be a bit more than a traditional hose, but I like the weight and ease of storage.  When it is time to replace my other hose, I will consider replacing it with an expansion hose.",1375401600,2013-08-02
2.0,"Upon getting the spray, I had a hard time getting the sprayer to prime up. It took about 5 minutes or so of opening and closing the nozzle and holding my finger on it blocking the spray hole to get it started. Once i did, it was very good. It has an easy adjustable spray tip that goes from an almost mist to stream. There's just a slight smell from it but its nothing offensive at all, reminded me of yogurt. It has a slight milky color to it which is nice because you can see where you've sprayed. The main ingredients are egg, capsacian and garlic. Pretty simple ingredients and the label says its harmless to animals and humans. I believe its USDA approved for organic gardens which means it should be safe but one never really knows.I've only had this a few days and will update in a few weeks but so far, the squirrels aren't attacking by bird feeders. They can't resist sunflower seeds which are for the birds not them and climb right up the thin wrought iron plant hangers. I wanted to give this a try because I can't spend all day chasing them away. They keep the birds from coming and can go thru the entire feeder in no time flat. You'll get a batch of squirrels that are very bold so I hope this stuff continues to keep they off the feeders. I don't care about the grounds but not on the feeders. I sprayed the polls and the feeders, without getting the openings for the seeds. I also sprayed the surrounding grass and plants under and around the feeders.The birds don't seem effected at all. They eat from the feeders and the grounds under them with no apparent issues. There were a few squirrels but they didn't stick around long. Not sure if it was the spray or that they saw me watching them...lol.  Again, I'll update this in a few short weeks and give my final thoughts.

This is the only product I will ever use to get rid of ants because it's so effective. The traps are easy to use and there's no mess even though they are liquid bait. You simply remove the stakes, push down and quarter turn the cup, and the bait drips into the reservoir. Just be careful not to tilt it though or the liquid will spill out. If you want you can use the stakes to secure them to the ground, but we just placed ours under the porch on the concrete and it works just as well.We had so much rain here this spring and summer so far that ants were flocking into my foyers in the basement and main floor and after two days of using these, I saw NO more ants! These come in a six pack so you can place them all around the house perimeter but you do need to replace them every few months, so one box lasts me a year. As a mom, this is a great ant repellent considering that I can't put traditional bait traps around the inside of the house since I have a toddler.

5.0,"Hello. My name is Momster and I am a gadget lover. Oh, I am also lazy...I got sick and tired of screwing and unscrewing my garden hoses whenever I wanted to swap from nozzle to sprinkler. Much to my delight, I found these years ago when buying a new sprinkler (a Gardena) and haven't been able to do without these since.I have a two-way connector attached to my spigot with a QC (Quick Connector), one side goes to our auto-timer that runs the sprinkler (told you I was a lazy gadget lover!!), and one to the regular cleaning/tasking hose. On the end of my tasking hose is another QC so I can slap on another sprinkler or nozzle with very little effort. Because I have a QC on the spigot as well, I can easily change hose configuration without breaking my back because I'd have to bend over AND twist around to access that one.NOTE: Because these are made of plastic, they do have a limited life - especially if you leave them out all year long. (Been there, done that.)  The summer sun and winter freeze will cause the pieces to crack sometimes, so be sure to check them before you use them at the start of the season.Part of the fun is figuring out which pieces should go to what. Have fun with that.

1.0,"Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily ""Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally"", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles. The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. They replied that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders. They also explicitly stated that they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder. Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it. This feeder has many _great_ properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives (of which there are plenty) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so.",1398470400,2014-04-26

5.0,"Earlier this fall, after a very expensive service call from a plumber, I found out that some creature chewed through the rubber tubes of my forced air heating system (plumber left me a chewed tube as evidence). I recall seeing some dropping in the basement, they did not look like mouse dropping (tubes rather than balls), so I got both a mouse trap and rat/chipmunk trapBig Snap-E Rat Trapas I don't want to have another service call.I am attaching a photo of both next to each other for size reference (I was wondering about this before buying both).  This weekend I set them both up, and they were fairly easy to set up. The instructions did not mention what to use as bait, so it took me some research to find what works best. It appears that many people find that peanut butter works best because it is sticky and cannot be easily carried away like a piece of cheese.I placed the traps on cardboard I cut away from a large cereal box.  This will make it easier to handle the disposal of the intruder.I was a bit worried that I will have trouble setting it up as due to a recent back surgery I can't put a lot strength into pushing on levels, but it was not hard. I had to push on the level until it caught a hook. The trap was fairly easy to set off, while I was moving it around to place in the right place it got set off. Luckiness I was not moving it with my hand.  Note that it got flipped and moved about 2 feet away from where it was before it triggered.Ali Julia review",1322956800,2011-12-04
5.0,"Purchased this item at 11 AM.  Used free supersaver shipping. Received the next day. Unreal.  Apparently these are stocked in local warehouses. I live in a small Ohio city. The tracking number immediately showed a UPS exception. This was a first. The product itself is nice. Well made.  Easy to use.  Some commented on the shipping carton.  It was a long box, with 2 separate box pieces taped together.  The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged.  It was fine.  I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage. The box is so odd shaped that nothing else will be piled on top. This will be a useful product. Added:  Minor dissapointment.  Just saw this in my big box grocery store for $ 69.00-full price.

4.0,"The Havaheart 1084 is for small animals such as rabbits, squirrels, small skunks, etc. with the idea of catching-and-releasing the animal.  The trap is so simple it comes only with a one-page manual and thankfully the trap arrives pre-assembled.  The manual gives ideas on some of the best bait for luring various animals.  I've tested the trap trigger with my hand, and it triggered every time.  I also tested over-sensitivity by lightly shaking the cage to simulate an animal jumping on it or rubbing against it, and the trap wasn't set off.  Wonderful!For the animals this trap is designed to catch, I do think that a small squirrel may sometimes be able to get the bait without triggering the trap.  Since squirrels sometimes distribute their overall body weight on their four legs, I'm not sure if this trap will trigger for small squirrels or anything smaller.  Normal size squirrels should definitely trip the trap.  Of course, if you place the bait all the way to the back, then the squirrel will have to fully walk over the trap plate increasing your odds of catching the animal.  Note that this trap isn't designed to catch full sized cats -- it's a bit too small for that so you'd be better off going with the larger brother, the 1085.  Also, if you are trying to catch a large skunk (i.e., as big as a full size cat or larger), go with the 1085.How long will this trap last sitting outside?  Will this trap start rusting or quickly wear-and-tear?  Will some of the plastic/rubber hold up under the sun?  Based on my tests with the 1085 (the larger brother), you will start seeing some light rust with the screws in the handle but I haven't seen rust on the trap's body.  No big deal though as functionality isn't impacted.  Plastic has held up well after being in the sun for six months.PROS====+ Light and easy to carry (given its size) with nice handle+ Super easy to set trap with just one hand+ Comes pre-assembled+ Easy to release animal w/o getting your fingers near animal+ Sturdy construction and no sharp edges that will hurt animal+ Very light trap door; unlikely animal would be hurt if door landed on tail or bodyCONS====+ Tricky to place bait in long cage (back/side door would be nice).  Pushing the bait through the holes on the side might be an alternative.+ Trigger weight high enough that smaller critters (e.g., mice, young rabbits, etc.) may not trigger trap.  No sensitivity setting on trap plate to adjust this.Overall, my initial impressions are very good with this trap, and I highly recommend it for the type of animals advertised.",1367971200,2013-05-08

4.0,"I enjoy gardening.  I plant A LOT of different crops and when I have pest problems or nutrient problems, I feel comfortable enough to find answers online.  When something dies prematurely, I view it more of a learning experience and feel better prepared for the next planting season.This product is an interesting concept - I can't help but smile when I look at it.  Inside the foil packaging is a 14"" (L) x 8"" (W) x 2"" (H) cardboard container that opens up to display 18 ready to plant pods.  The literature is simple and tastefully done.  They include plant spacing (with a paper ruler), recipes, tips for growing, and websites for additional information.  You basically take the cover off of the biodegradable pods (there is more nutrient literature under each paper lid - I was unable to view this as my paper lids stuck together), push the pod into your soil, and then remember to water.  You could plant most of the pods indoors (close to a light source) or outdoors.  You could also plant in pots or right into ground that has been properly tilled.The variety of vegetable and herbs provided with this kit are the ""easy to grow"" varieties.  You'll receive Basil, Cilantro, Dill, several varieties of Lettuce and 2 different Tomatoes, a Snap Pea pod, Cucumber pod, and a Bush Bean pod.  Basically, you provide adequate water and it grows.  Each pod has Miracle-Gro plant food in the tip of the pod and at least 2 seeds in each pod.  If you get more than one seedling in each pod (and you probably will), you could carefully separate the seedling but for the novice gardener, it would be easier to simply pull out the weaker/smaller seedlings once the strongest seedling is at least 2"" high.  You're guaranteed to have a plant grow - They claim satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.  I suspect more information is available on-line to exercise the guarantee (there was nothing specific in the included literature).I couldn't help but think that kids would LOVE this product.  What a great Birthday present for the child who has a Spring Birthday - Seed Pods that just need pushed into soil and perhaps some small gardening tools.It's a cute product but if you're an experienced gardener - I rather doubt you'd see any economical benefit in this product.  Seeds are incredibly cheap and even if you were to plant each of the varieties in this kit with seedlings bought from a nursery, you'd likely pay less than what this kit costs (and the seedlings would produce a fruit/vegetable faster since it's weeks ahead of a newly planted pod).",1370476800,2013-06-06

I have several concerns though, a couple which I hope may turn out to be unfounded.  First of all, it seems very light and thin and I wonder if it may dent easily.  Secondly, I wonder how long the finish will last.  It appears to be painted with a copper finish and then sealed.  The last thing is not technically a concern, but an aggravation.

4.0,"I must admit that I was a bit surprised when I opened this grill cover. Grill covers I have had in the past has been thick plastic that when the weather got cold, they were difficult to get on the grill because they lost some of their elasticity. They sometimes ripped when they got this cold. This cover, I think, will not have this problem.The reason is that the fabric material of this cover is very thin. Although it is lightweight, it does seem durable. The product description says that the microporous membrane technology provides 100% waterproof protection and enhanced breathability to prevent trapped moisture and that the corrode Blok Active Vapor Corrosion Inhibitor (VCI) Technology reduces rust and corrosion, extending the life of your grill. I hope that this is the case. It fits very nicely over my Weber Spirit E-310.

5.0,"I got this rotisserie for chicken, which it excels at, but the design makes it less than ideal for other meats.  For chicken the spit and and forks work well, as the center of the bird is hollow and having metal forks pierce the meat has little consequence.  Larger birds won't fit due to the size of the grill and placement of the rotisserie.  As it is, you will need to remove the grates (or stack them on one side if only cooking one bird) to allow for rotation of chicken, but the flavorizer bars can remain.  Other types of meat may fit, but having a spit and forks pierce a roast will heat the meat nearest these metal pieces (due to conduction).  I'd imagine this isn't as much of a deal for pork, but I wouldn't want the center of a prime rib to be medium well due to the spit.  I'd suggest an E-Z Que for that.Back to the chicken.  As others have said be sure to truss or tie down wings and legs,as they will get well done due to their proximity to the flame.  This will also create more clearance between the chicken and the flavorizer bars.  In general cooking times are comparable to other means, but unlike ""beer can chicken"" withWeber 16128 Poultry Roaster, the chicken will cook from the outside in (due to steam on the inside with beer can chicken).  This along with better retention of juices (not many drip down) makes the rotisserie my favorite of the two.  The cord is woefully short, but the motor seems very solid, and it's not that noisy.  The spit seems to allow for a bit of balancing of weight, and it's relatively easy to clean.",1263081600,2010-01-10
3.0,"Aqua Globes are one of those myriad ""as seen on TV"" products that promise to change your life. Mrs. Spudman picked up a box  along with the equally promising ""Smooth Away"" miracle that is also ""seen on TV.""In the box were two Aqua Globes, each made of hand-blown glass, and even this skeptical Spudman must admit are somewhat attractive and stylish. The globes are about 11 inches long and far too fragile to put into the hands of your pet gorilla or chimpanzee.The long thin tips are ""cut"" at an angle at the ends to help with ease of filling and inserting into potting soil.When we bought our present home, we inherited a potted palm tree that's' close to five feet tall now. It showed signs of stress after being transplanted into a larger pot, so Mrs. Spudman chose it as a candidate for the Aqua Globes.After several weeks, I noticed that the Aqua Globes were still full of water and brought it to the attention of the Globe master. She pulled out the devices, cleaned compacted dirt from the ends, and reinserted them at a different angle and depth. This seemed to do the trick because the globes needed refilling about a week hence. One site I browsed suggesting putting a piece of screen around the tip of the Aqua Globe to prevent dirt clogs.Filling the globes is time consuming and tedious because one has to use a gentle, thin flow from the spigot. Mrs. Spudman started using a small funnel for filling and seems to be happier with this procedure.Before inserting the globes into the soil, one is advised to predrill a hole using a stick, dowel, chopstick, or screwdriver. An electric drill makes a big mess with flying dirt and is not recommended for making the preparatory hole. If you don't make an insertion hole first, you might break the globe's delicate neck or clog the end with soil, neither of which is desirable.It took some trial and error for Mrs. Spudman to determine just the right angle and depth for her Aqua Globes. They seem to be working as promised at the moment, and the palm tree test subject seems healthy and happy.Finally -Mrs. Spudman is relatively happy with her Aqua Globes though not particularly enthusiastic about them. We both agree that they are an attractive novelty.To ensure that a cherished plant is getting water while you're away on vacation, these Aqua Globes may not be a bad option. If you have many cherished plants, this option could become expensive.Mrs.Spudman sort of likes her Aqua Globes. I think they are silly and unnecessary gimmicks of dubious value that at least don't harm plants. Watering plants is not that much work and isn't all that time consuming. If you resent the time and effort spent watering houseplants, then maybe you shouldn't have any. Most importantly the use of Aqua Globes deprives the plants of personal contact with their caretaker(s) , quality time shared, and the all important bonding experience.Thus I give them a lukewarm recommendation.",1280016000,2010-07-25
3.0,"I was expecting more than a 1 inch thick scour-pad. If your intention for this purchase was to lighten up the weight of your pot you will need several of these to accomplish that. The drainage ability works great. It seems dense enough to not compress with the typical potting mix used for containers like8 Quart Organic Potting Mix - Part #: AP8. If all you were looking to accomplish was some better drainage this will work great, but I would minimally use 2 of these disks for that purpose. It will not take much water to occupy the 1 inch of spacing that this disc will give you. If you have a heavy hand with the watering can you may be better served by using some water balls likeAqua Globes AG011706 Glass Plant Watering Bulbs, 2-Pack.

3.0,"I am a real fan of Havahart products.  Quality material, and they stand behind their products.  This is my first double-door trap, the Havahart 1061 Easy Set 2 Door Trap.  It's for smaller mammals, like squirrels and rats.  It has the easy to set handle, and a cable can be detached to make this a single-door trap (easily done).  The wire cage right next to the trigger plate is slightly wider than in the rest of the trap, allowing for your finger to reach inside and set off the trap when testing.However, my model, for both the double and single-door versions, was not well adjusted.  That is, when set, the slightest bump would set the trap off (&#34;hair trigger&#34;).  It was too sensitive.  I could pull up on the primary door when opened and that would make it better, but I shouldn't have to do this.  In any case, make sure your trap is positioned firmly against the ground (no wobbling), baited with the right material to attract the specific animal you want to trap, and that you have a plan in place before you start trapping to deal with the captured animal.",1401148800,2014-05-27

3.0,"I've had this bird feeder for about two years, and like it so much that I got another.  The feeder gets a lot of clinging bird action, much more than other wired feeders in our yard.  The birds seem to prefer the fly-through openings, and they have no problems pulling out sunflower seed through the wires.  Squirrels extract seeds too, but with difficulty.  They can wriggle through two circular holes at once, with a tail poking out one end and a head sticking out the other.  While that's comical to watch, it's not fun seeing determined squirrels try to bend and break the wire mesh.  The feeder is now off-limits to them.I like the easy-fill cap, all-metal construction, and the fact birds can land anywhere to get a seed.  It does create somewhat of a mess on the ground, but that goes with the territory of bird feeding.  I never tire watching birds at this feeder, especially during wintertime when activity is high.UPDATE:  While the second feeder I just received resembles the first feeder in looks, it is apparent Perky-Pet has cut some corners.  The wire construction (particularly where connecting with the metal framework) is shoddy workmanship.  I can easily push the interior wires in (leaving an open gap).  They used to be solidly connected (soldered) to the metal square and circle framework.  Just imagine what a pesky squirrel could do with those wires now.  The wire itself is no longer coated either, so I wonder how long it will take before rusting begins.  The easy fill cap design has also changed for the worse.  My original feeder's roof clamped down on the body so no thieving varmints could pry it off.  This new one has one of those awful buttons that supposedly locks the roof in place, but every feeder I've used that has one operates poorly.I'm disappointed Perky-Pet took a good product and turned it into junk.  Even though my first feeder is a little beat up, I have the feeling it will outlast the second one I just received.  Five stars for an entertaining feeder that birds actively like and use, but two stars for inferior quality.",1393200000,2014-02-24

I called the manufacturer (Rollin) and they sent me a new saw without any argument.  Meanwhile I manually oiled the old saw and was able to cut up 4 face cords of firewood with the same ease as the gas saws I had previously owned.  This saw is able to take a beating.

5.0,"The Ravenna grill cover is a high quality grill cover that appears to be ready to weather the elements over the long haul.  I installed the medium size version of this cover on my Weber Silver B grill.  In the past I've always used the Weber 7573 premium covers and those have served me well.The Ravenna cover is a clear step up in quality and materials versus the Weber cover.  For starters, the Ravenna cover has a much heavier feel.  On the outside it has a heavy-vinyl like feel, similar to the Weber premium cover.  On the inside, the Ravenna cover has an entirely separate heavy-plastic layer that the Weber cover doesn't have.There are a number of vents to allow wind to pass through without lifting the cover off the grill.  In each case, the vents are constructed so that rain would actually have to blow upwards in order to get under the cover.  The Ravenna grill cover also has a simple and easy-to-use strapping system along the bottom that allows you to cinch it around the bottom of your grill stand so that no amount of wind can blow it away.The Weber premium cover typically lasts me about 24 months of outdoor use in the brutal Texas sun before I have to replace.  Only time will tell how the Ravenna grill cover will fare, but given the construction quality, I expect at least that length of time before it needs replacing.One minor complaint: the medium sized cover is about two inches too tall for my Weber Silver B.  This means the bottom of the cover is on the ground.  Once you cinch it up, you don't notice this, but it does mean you have to remove the cover before you can push the grill (I move my grill away from the house before I use it).  Other than the height, this cover is a good fit on the Weber Silver B (which is about the same size as the Weber Spirit 200/300 grills).",1374624000,2013-07-24

5.0,"Birds I love, but what they often leave behind I don't.  I've been interested in the Enviro-Spike as a temporary measure, but will probably have a use for it down the line.  I didn't install it, but rather place it as a test to see whether it would deter birds from perching on one or the other of my vehicles for extended periods of time.I was getting rather tired of hosing down my car and listening to all the comments about how the birds love me.  Well, I didn't love them back much when they peppered my vehicle.  Problem solved, the questions have stopped and I don't have to hose down my car.  I swear I had a flock of grackles enjoying the top of that car.  I simply did a temporary tie job during the night and the Enviro-Spikes were enough to deter them.One of the more permanent uses would be for things such as deck railings.  That's where these Enviro-Spikes will probably find their next home, hopefully a temporary one just until they find another roost.  It's an easy, affordable solution to a problem that is not only unsightly, but unsanitary.  Whatever they are used for and in whatever capacity, they will probably work.",1401235200,2014-05-28

To my great surprise it also has a zippered pocket for storing things.  A few tools perhaps, a recipe/instruction book.  I am not sure I will use that, but it is nice to have just in case.It covers the grill quite well.  In my case it hangs past the grill bottom onto the floor.

Just set it and forget about it.The thermometer set up easily with the Android app on my HTC One.  I like being able to choose which cut of meat I'm using and having the app choose the temperate for me.  We can pick between gourmet temps or USDA recommended temps.I can also use my own temp settings (140 to 399 F), and there are four timer settings for each probe.  What for?  Adding marinade or turning the meat.  So very useful.For the pork roast last night, the device sounded several minutes before my app got word of it, but that's all right.Some improvements I would like to see include a container or bag to keep all the equipment together.

When the lights go out, the last thing you want to do is hunt around for your little screwdriver just to change the batteries. A snap-on/snap-off type of lid would have been much better.But that&#8217;s it! Everything else about this grill light is awesome!  It only takes three batteries and pumps out a decent amount of light for a long time. The official count is 20 hours, although I haven&#8217;t timed that myself. It mounts easily to a number of surfaces, including the intended grill lid. The touch on/touch off switch is great and easy to use.Like many people, I sues this grill light for more than just grilling.

I own the Solo backpack (too heavy and cumbersome - doesn't want to fit through small places or doors) the 1 gallon Hudson sprayer (okay, but I don't like the spray - it tends to spit instead of spray - and needs a lot of pumping - you have to pump it while it is on the ground, so if you are spraying a lot you are leaning over a lot) and the spray-n-grow sprayers (needs four batteries and won't take rechargeable batteries - and also tends to spit instead of spray).This is the best of the lot - it has a really nice atomizing type of spray - I like the over-spray attachment.  It doesn't take much pumping to spray for quite a bit.  Has a nice lock feature.  Best of all its nicely balanced - I am only 5' tall with small hands and it works nicely for me.  Easy refilling and easy cleaning.At this price you could have one for each type of product you use.

5.0,"Plant spikes have been around for just about as long as house plants have.  They are one of the oldest ways of fertilizing potted plants as there is going. (Someone with roots in their blood once told me that solid fertilizer preceded the liquid variety by quite a respectable amount of time.  The liquid variety being easier, but not necessarily better).  A lot of folks don't seem to use them anymore since liquid fertilizers mixed with your regular watering are so much easier.  My own experience with both is that the solid, slow dissolving spikes last longer, feed the plant the nutrients more efficiently over the longer amount of time, and genuinely do a better job of giving your plants the extra boost of good stuff all house plants can use. I am not a horticulturist and certainly do not claim to know this is a fact over a reasonable theory.  What I do know is I have some of the biggest, healthiest house plants I have witnessed among my many peers that dabble in the home spun gardening trade as well.  I stopped using liquid fertilizers years ago and have had excellent results with these spikes.  You thumb them down just under the surface every couple of months and watch your house plants love you for it.  I highly recommend the Jobe fertilizer spikes, and, I also recommend that if you can't or don't care to locate them locally, that you buy them in bulk here on Amazon and make the shipping worth it.

5.0,"I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12"" away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren't in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I've been very lucky so far, I've been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.I've only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it'd be fine for watering a really large area that hasn't been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement.",1338595200,2012-06-02

2.0,"I usually garden with starts, not seeds, so I thought these might be a good way to learn to love seeds, but I was so disappointed. While there is a nice variety, once I opened it up and read the directions, I was a bit aghast at how little food this kit makes, and how much packaging it uses. I think I pictures smaller pods--more like little protective peat bullets--and a lot more of them, 18 types, not 18 total (so that's my fault--but that doesn't make this product any less silly). These are little pointy peat pots, about the size of a tiny Dixie cup, filled with soilless mix and 2 seeds, with a peel off lid like a little tub of coffee creamer.I'd give it 0 stars for me, but if you're a city dweller with only a tiny sunny balcony and a few pots, or someone not concerned with actual yield who just wants a tidy, educational project for small kids, this might be a fun and cute way to grow a bitty bit of food. If you have any space at all, it makes no sense.Seriously, who plants one bush bean plant? That's one dinner. Ditto the lettuce and pepper.Even if your space is limited, if you want one of each plant, buy starts for the herbs and vegetables and a packet of bean seeds. You'll spend about the same, get to pick more interesting varieties, and be that much closer to harvest and with no fussing over tender shoots, which can get knocked off by one hungry bug or especially hot or cold morning. Or if you love seeds, this price tag will get you a good 8-12 packets or more of seeds, giving you a full garden, and probably plenty to save for next year.Germination wasn't spectacular, either. The cups didn't seem to hold any more moisture than just plain soil (but I do have good, sheep poo-enriched soil), and didn't germinate any better than bare seeds. I don't get the rave reviews, unless others are a lot richer and grow vegetables for novelty rather than the table.If this were an herbs-only kit, I *might* be able to see it, since that's more where you'll see spreading and a couple seeds going a long way.

5.0,This two ounce container of rooting hormone don&#8217;t sound like much but it will go a long way. I only use a dusting when using it so it will probably last me for years. I recently used this rooting hormone to grow a new knockout rose from a clipping that I took from one of my huge ones out front. It was extremely simple to do and anyone can do it. I clipped a nice little section from my rose bush. I clipped it at an angle just below one of the little branches. Then I got the bottom of the clipping wet and dusted it with a light but even layer of this rooting hormone. After that I planted the clipping in potting soil. I watered it daily to keep the roots moist. About two weeks later I checked up on it and it had grown very nice looking roots on it. For the time being I am allowing it to continue growing in the potting soil and will plant it in my flower bed when I am sure it&#8217;s not going to frost again. This rooting hormone seems to work very well to me.,1394668800,2014-03-13

5.0,"I have five EB now. I really like them for veggies, esp tomatoes. One box holds one big tomatoe, not two. The EB website forum gets a bit nasty about following the directions perfectly, but I have found them to be guidelines.Hint one, the box can use potting soil,not just soilless mixtures.Two, the fertilizer included may not be enough, extra food can be added after a month or so, tomatoes are big eaters.Three, the plastic cover is not necessary, it just molds here in the NW.Occasional top water & food will not ruin the system.The water tank holds two gallons, and for precise indoor gardening, you will need to make a dip stick.( this number is no where on the website, I hand measured, because I do feed some plants liquied food in the resovir)My one wish is the boxes could be deeper for deep rooted plants.One box has a loose wheel I should have complained about right away. On the subject of wheels, play with all the wheels and make sure the box rolls right before adding weight, I move mine a lot and wish I had fussed with rolling first. Shipping was amazon super speed, and the amazon price hovers around 55 -65$, with shipping and wheels, which is cheaper than the EB website.Happy gardening.",1208476800,2008-04-18
4.0,"I've owned a couple of EasyBloom devices (later sold to Black and Decker) and now this Parrot Flower Power to monitor plant conditions.  Although I'm an experienced gardener, I have houseplants located in areas that I forget to check as well as the occasional struggling plant.  The original EasyBloom didn't have soil fertility information, and when the next generation did, with a paid fertilization subscription, I was thrilled.  I was worried that this Parrot Flower Power wouldn't have that information, and again, I was thrilled that it did.  After all, an experienced gardener can tell whether a plant is likely getting the right amount of sun or water, but the richness of the soil is an entirely different matter.  For this reason, the Flower Power promises to work for both beginning and intermediate -- maybe even advanced -- gardeners.  Still, it needs some work to be a five-star product.First, a warning:  this works only on iPhones.  Not computers.  Not Android devices, although the web site promises that function soon.  Not even on an iPad.  This kind of limited use suggests the release of a product that should have waited several more months before introduction.  Fortunately, I have an iPhone.  There are other drawbacks -- I'll get to them at the end.  The iPhone app is relatively easy to use, although not elegant.To setting up the device is relatively easy, although you'll have to wait for 24 hours before the information starts getting sent to your device and alert email address.  All you need to do is download the free app, create your account, insert the included AAA battery, select the plant you will be monitoring from the database, insert the monitor into the soil, and wait.  Some people have complained that the information gathered is too vague; however, if your plant isn't getting enough light, just move it to a sunnier location and see whether that's enough.  If it needs more water, give it some, and if it's too wet, wait longer between waterings.  If it needs fertilizer, give it a dose and wait to see if it's enough.  The fact that this device CAN analyze soil fertility is pretty amazing.  Think about it.  Unless you are a master gardener with the proper tools, you are unlikely to be able to make more than an educated guess about whether your plant has enough food.The database of plants and information is large enough for most people.  I like that I entered ""Mona Lavender"", and the database came back with the correct hit, albeit in a different name:  Swedish Ivy.  The search function cross-references plant names, as long as you spell them correctly.  If you don't know the name of your plant, you won't be able to monitor it unless you assign a random plant to your garden.  You can monitor up to 256 Flower Power devices (imagine the cost!), one at a time, supposedly in sequence.Unfortunately, despite the potential of this device, it has some drawbacks besides the limited platform.  The device works using a Bluetooth connection, which limits the range.  If you put the Parrot outside or in a remote part of your house, you have to have your iPhone nearby and for long enough to receive the data.  Ideally, this device should be configured to work both over a home network AND via Bluetooth to a phone.  Because I'm monitoring a plant outside of my normal Bluetooth range (that's why I'm monitoring it -- I tend to forget about it), I don't always get the alerts in a timely manner that it needs water.  The GOOD part of the Bluetooth capabilities, however, is that you can monitor a plant far away from your computer.  I have a large property, and I can monitor a remote planting as long as I get close enough for the Flower Power to upload the data.  The instructions are a mess, too.  Instead of giving all instructions in English, then French, then Spanish, etc., the instructions give a little in English, then switch to the other languages, then back to English.  I had to weed through all the other languages to find the next set of information.  As a result, the set-up seemed much more complicated than it really was.I like this device a lot, although it could use improvements and enhancements.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",1389830400,2014-01-16
5.0,"This chair cover far surpasses covers that I spent the same amount of money on at a local big box superstore. This one has elastic to fit the bottom around the chair, with pull strings to tighten it down. It also has clips and straps to secure it to the chair. In comparison, the big box competitor version had cheap flimsy ties that broke quickly, and so loose they flapped around. In contrast, this one is great!This fits on my swivel wicker chair with a pile of cushions and pillows stuffed underneath for protection. It is made of a sturdy canvas that is contoured to fit the chair. It's waterproof with moisture beading up and rolling off.The best part of this cover is that it can be fitted so well that the cover does not blow off in the wind or flap around. The straps and elastic bands make it possible to fit it to several different chair shapes in the same size range. It also has a convenient handle on the front for lifting it up to remove it.The color is described as taupe. It's fairly dark, a brownish/olive color. Yeah, I guess that would be taupe. It's pretty true to the color in the photo.Now that I have reviewed this one, I want to purchase another one to put on my other chair!",1379289600,2013-09-16
4.0,"Every time we rake and bag leaves (which is often-- there are so many trees where I live that Direct TV won't even try to provide service...), I am struck by the wastefulness.  I feel like giving leaves, which could be a good fertilizer, to someone else to mulch is wasteful, the carbon footprint of the truck that picks up the bags is wasteful, and the bags themselves are wasteful.  But of course if you leave your leaves on the ground, they kill the grass.  This electric leaf shredder is (almost) exactly what I always wanted.PROS:+ The big one of course is that this solves the wastefulness problem outlined above.+ Makes nutrient-mulch for your garden.  This is easy to distribute and I just rake it in a bit.+ Collects in whatever bag or container you prefer+ Easy set-up+ Has settings for dry or wet leaves/clippings+ Has settings for fine, medium, or coarse grind, or pine needles.+ Height-adjustable+ Comes with replacement cutting line (like weed-whacker line but thicker)+ Easy to string replacement line+ Very fast with dry leaves+ Teenagers less likely to avoid leaf chores as they see this as both effort-saving and cool.CONS:- Loud loud LOUD!  The first time we tried it we thought it was going to explode.- Damp leaves can be mulched almost as quickly as dry, but they need a little help.  I use the butt of my rake to push them down; they just don't slide as easily down the hopper as dry leaves.BOTTOM LINE:Saves some effort as opposed to bagging, is less wasteful than bagging/collecting, makes a nice mulch for your garden, time-efficient with dry leaves - less so with wet.TIP:  Wear glasses in case of blowback.",1389830400,2014-01-16

5.0,"Arrived on time. I have a magna hand truck I bought from a store about 2 years ago. I am not sure if that was the original hand truck another reviewer was referring to. This hand truck that I recently bought is a bit different but I think is just as good as the original. The difference is the the button that one pushes to lenghten the handle. This button is on top. The original was not a button but an orange or reddish handle below the top handle that you have to pull up. Somtimes when I just want to move the hand truck I inadvertently lift the colored handle and the hand truck lenghtens downwards sometimes hitting my feet. So the orange button in the newer magna hand truck is in my view an improvement. The other difference in the new magna hand truck is the color and maybe the material of the part that supports the load one is carrying on the cart. In the original it looks like it is part alumminum and shinny, in the newer magna hand truck it looks like it also part alumminum and some other material, perhaps ceramic, the color is grayish green.  The same load capacity.",1355788800,2012-12-18
3.0,"The idea of the platform feeder is great.  We have several bird feeders around our house, mostly hanging in trees suspended so they can be lowered for cleaning and filling.  Each and every one is constantly raided by our plethora of squirrels.  The plastic of the feeders is chewed apart by the squirrels, most of the seed goes to them, and the rest they find ways to jump on the feeders to spill the seeds on the ground where they all can gather with ease.The design of the Perky-Pet includes an Umbrella type cover that attaches loosely to the hanger.  It is meant to be loose so that if a squirrel or other mean, old seed predator tries to jump on top, it simply tips to the side and they fall off.  It does do that...the squirrels have failed in every attempt to gain access.  However, in any breeze, that same umbrella top flips around, up and down, from side to side, and scares the birds off!As a result, after 2 weeks of hanging in a tree, nary a seed is gone.  Guess it will help save costs of seed, but I am hoping the birds adjust to it soon.UPDATED POST:I am going to have to locate a spot completely out of the wind for this feeder.  Calm, almost windless day today and the birds are all over it.  Meanwhile, the squirrels keep trying and it is fun watching them become dive-bombers to the ground.  I have secluded spots to place it, but the only trouble is it's out of sight from any window, and is not where we can enjoy seeing the birds feeding.FINAL UPDATE:This feeder is never going to be worthwhile.  It needed to be removed from any area that had wind, even light breezes, and we did that.  Unfortunately, birds like to feed where there is cover and the only place this could be mounted was in a small niche in the house side.  No birds came to feed.  Taking it down tomorrow and putting it away in the basement.",1394496000,2014-03-11

5.0,"My husband is the mousetrap man and has used these traps several times with success.  He uses a bit of peanut butter and yes, it&#8217;s sometimes stolen before any mouse is trapped.  These are a bit fancier than the Victor, but work somewhat similarly.  The trick is in how to set them.  There are directions on the package, but like most people, I think using a mousetrap is intuitive and never bothered to read them.  There are visuals to additionally help the hapless mousetrap person like me.  I&#8217;ll type them out exactly as they appear on the package:Here&#8217;s How to Use:1)  Bait trigger of Trap withTOMCAT Mouse Attractant Gelor peanut butter.2)  Set trap by putting U-shaped bar to opposite end and insert tip of pin into underside of trigger.  Move pin toward &#8220;S&#8221; on trigger, for more sensitive trigger setting.3)  Place against walls where mice travel.My husband claims that these traps are quite sensitive and have often gone off in his hands.  Our &#8220;busiest&#8221; season is in the fall when the field mice decide to make their way into the barn, an outbuilding, or the house.  We don&#8217;t get hoards of them, but enough to really annoy me.One suggestion, for those who get large field mice, chipmunks, or red squirrels in outbuildings, is to attach a wire to the loop at the end of the trap and then tie it down.  We&#8217;ve lost a lot of traps in the barn.  Unsure whose walking off with them, but critters don&#8217;t always leave them behind.  The Tomcat?

3.0,"I used Garden Genius Lightweight Pot Fillers for the first time today in the 11.5 and 6.25 inch sizes.  It was the easiest potting I've ever done.  Usually my potting projects start with a lengthy search for the perfect rock or pot shard to cover the hole at the bottom of the pot.  But this time I slapped in the pot filler, added soil, the plant and water.  Not a speck of soil escaped the pots and the water drains freely.  I was finished in a fraction of the time and had no mess to clean up other than washing my hands.  I am a believer in how well it works.However, it is far too expensive for all my potting needs.  My plants remain in pots for years at a time, so it is doubtful I will ever re-use the pot filler.  The pot filler fabric resembles a scratchy pot scrubber and is easily cut to size, so I am taking the advice of another reviewer and ordering the Garden Genius GG-ROLL-1 Durable Pot Filler Roll, 12-Inch x 52-Inch which is a fraction of the price and should be just as effective.

2.0,"The only reason I gave this feeder two stars instead of only one is that I like the glass bottle, much nicer than plastic.  Even at that, the glass is hard to clean unless you have an overpriced feeder ""mop"" or a flexible bottle brush.Despite the advantage of glass over plastic, this feeder is not even useable.  I hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy.  It leaks when the wind blows.  It leaks when the temperature rises.  It leaks just because it feels like leaking.  And that attracts ants, armies of tiny, biting ants.  I've tried filling it to almost the top and I've tried putting just a bit of food in it - doesn't matter, it leaks.Even if that weren't a problem, I still would not like this feeder.  The plastic bottom and the flowers inserted into it are next to impossible to clean.  The flowers have little ridges that cry out to be filled with mold and nasties.  A dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all.  I think the manufacturer is doing the birds a real disservice by selling something that is likely to end up with dirt and mold, and be bad for the birds.So, this product is for the birds.

After a minute of playing with the buttons, I learned that despite the size if my fingertips, they were the best and most reliable tool to switch the buttons.  So, when using my finger tips, the buttons switch every time.

I'm happy to say that it was fast, easy, and not messy at all.  It took me about a minute to get the old spark plug loosened up without breaking it (we have a spark plug socket), but the new plug was a perfect match and screwed right in.  The new air filter was also just like the dirty one (extremely dirty!) and installed easily.Changing the oil was slightly harder but I managed to do it without spilling, breaking or losing anything.  I ran the engine for a minute or two, to warm up the oil, then wiped around the oil plug (where an inch of grass and dirt had built up) before opening the plug.  I tipped the mower to drain the old oil out (into the included cup) and then replaced the plug.  Next I used the included funnel to pour in the new oil and I was done!

3.0,"As a serious bird enthusiast, I have a fairly elaborate setup to attract them and have many.  This feeder seemed a good addition, but there are problems.  To begin with, when it arrived the black cap that covers the spring mechanism in the interior bottom of the feeder was loose in the box.  I don't think it was supposed to be as the directions didn't mention it and it was quite hard to reattach.  The feeder is really big, but not big enough for me to get my arm all the way down inside it to replace this part.  I finally got it placed by using a reacher/grabber gadget, but couldn't get it pushed down firmly.  As a result I expect problems sooner or later.  Right now it's working, though.The directions did show how to attach the pieces of the top, but I found it annoying that you can't set the feeder down with both the lid and the dome pieces attached as they come apart.  I figured out that the dome shaped cover piece is supposed to stay hung at the location you've chosen and only the tube with its lid is to be removed from the underside hook for refilling.Regarding the refilling:  On the good side, the big open tube is easy to fill with most scoops and can accommodate a wide mouth funnel that further speeds filling and minimizes spilled seed.  On the down side, detaching and reattaching the lid is awkward since the tiny side wires of the lid have to fit into equally tiny holes pierced in the tube, and which aren't easily visible since they are slightly recessed under the lid.  You have to squeeze the tube a bit to make it wide enough for the pins to get inside, then releasing it lets them seat if you have them in the correct position.  These holes are very near the top of the tube and should they break when the plastic is hard, during the winter, for example, the whole feeder becomes useless.  The whole weight of this feeder hangs on the two little holes in the plastic which are only about "" from the top of the tube. Only time will tell how long the feeder lasts and given the fact that one assumes squirrels will be jumping on it, trying to get at the seed, I have concerns.Another issue I have with the feeder is that the perches are very short.  So far only the tiniest birds have been able to feed from it, the chickadees and wrens.  Others may get the hang of it and I put the best no mess seed in it to encourage them.  I'll just have to wait and see.I have several feeders, all of which are very sturdy and need to be. For one thing, they can easily tip over on the uneven gravel where I fill them, which I have to do as often every other day during heavy feeding times.  They are almost never without many birds vying for the best perch and suffer regular attacks from crows and squirrels.  Both these marauders mostly enjoyed the tray feeder as all the others are tube feeders and squirrel proof (not that they don't get worked over).  I hated to have to remove the tray as some of the birds I most prize seeing prefer it, but the crows and squirrels drive me nuts.  So far this feeder has deterred both, which is a definite plus.Considering how expensive this feeder is, I expect it to do a good job at both satisfying my birds and deterring squirrels--and it has to last a long time.  I'll update after an extended trial period.  I've only had it up a week at this point.  Maybe it will grow on me.Update 9/18/13:  I left my other feeders empty for a while so the birds would work harder to use this one and the finches and titmice have decided it's okay.  The bigger birds still can't get purchase, but at least it's useful for the smaller ones.  It was easy to refill.  I feel a bit more positive toward it at this point.Update 10/12/13: Not feeling so positive anymore as the top broke off while refilling today making the feeder essentially useless because you can't rehang it.  Some super glue might work to reattach the hanging wire to the lid.",1377907200,2013-08-31

It has brass components, a nice sturdy feel and is rated for both extreme hot and cold water conditions.  It attaches easily and does not drip at all during use.

4.0,"The little battery pack did pretty good at giving my cell phone a quick charge to about half power. Enough to make a few calls and last till I could get back home to charge it. The solar panels are a bit slow even on a clear day. They would work ok for when you are out camping and you want to recharge your MP3 player or tablet. If it had another pair of panels to fold out and double the solar collection of power it would really help this a lot. To give it a good test I put a set of 4 rechargeable AA batteries that were dead in it and hung the solar panels in a south facing window. It took a good 2 days to get a usable charge in them and almost 3 full days to get close to a full charge. Now if it was laying out flat on something and got full on sunshine on it I'm sure it would have done a lot better. The best use I can see for this is to take it with you when you go camping or back packing for when you have the time to wait and good cloud free sky and plenty of sunshine along with a couple extra sets of rechargeable batteries to have one set recharge with it while using another set in your radio or MP3 player or what ever.Overall its bit too expensive and too slow to actually be practical for use around the home when you can plug a charger in the wall that's a lot quicker and easier to use. But, for those that live on the Gulf Coast or East Coast and often get hit with storms that can take out the power for several days to weeks at a time then this, or something like this, might be something to consider putting in your emergency supplies.

I love the way the light shines through these and our selfish little hummingbird seems to prefer this blue one over his red and green feeders.

He will even hover over you to check you out while you remove the feeders for cleaning and filling.I started  hanging hummingbird feeders as a fun thing to do with my granddaughter when she was was just a toddler. She loved watching the birds and hearing them fly around. Years later she still loves hummingbirds, I like to think I played a part in that.  One of these would make a wonderful gift for a child.

This extender is great for keeping my off my hands and knees and away from the creepy crawlers.I do wish it came with a leader, but I was able to make a custom one of just the right length in about 5 minutes with some scrap hose and a couple of menders (like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Male-Coupling-01M/dp/B00002N66T and this one http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Female-Coupling-01F/dp/B00002N66U/--I went with the cheapies because I've used them before and I won't be taking the leader on and off, and they're not in direct sunlight). I used teflon tape at the connectors, and added a splitter (I used this one, which has big, easy lever handles: http://www.amazon.com/Nelson-Rezimar-High-Water-Kink-Free-50315/dp/B0015AOEYC/), so now I have two hoses in a stable base at a good height. Hooray!The fittings are nice brass fittings. I did use teflon tape, but didn't replace the old hose gaskets, and I had no leaks at the input or outputs, even under pressure. The frame looks to be powder coated steel in dark green to camouflage in bushes, square tubular metal, nice and heavy.It's a bit hard to push in and not 100% stable in really rocky soil (ours is basically gravel held together with fine topsoil), but that's tru of pretty much anything jammed into the ground around our building, since you essentially have to rock it in--just giving a warning if you have really rocky soil.",1403049600,2014-06-18

4.0,"I like the fact that this trap hides the mouse from view (some may not need that, but I like it).  I don't hate the site of mice, but I just feel guilty when I see them killed (had a pet mouse when I was a kid).  I have always had problems setting up the normal spring/snap regular traps.  My fingers usually get caught several times before I get it set up. Then I get frustrated when I've finally gotten it set up and then it snaps when I set it on the floor and move it into place. Also, with my dog running around the house and shaking the floor while she runs, they would sometimes snap (I ALWAYS put them under and behind stands/furniture so she doesn't get to them physically, but the motion from her playing hard can sometimes set them off).I've tried another brand of the out-of-site type of trap, but they did not work at all for me.  I don't recall the brand, but they were circular and you twisted it to set it into place.  Never worked at all.  I've used Victor products before with success -- flea trap with sticky paper, cover, and lamp -- works good.  I've also used spider traps by them, which are just sticky paper, but I don't put them inside the house in any rooms that my dog could remotely get to or stretch her paw to get.  I don't want to chance it that she would get stuck to the paper, so using just the sticky paper in the house to catch a mouse is out of the question for me. Also, I think it's cruel to catch mice with it since they will often try to chew off there legs to get loose.  I only use the paper for bugs and spiders during the humid, summer months in my laundry room and spare/storage room that has a lot of moisture and is closed off from the rest of the house.This Victor Kill & Seal Mouse Trap is a great concept and made very sturdy.  I am impressed and quite pleased. I have not caught a mouse with it yet -- have not yet seen any signs of mice yet, but I'm sure that will come soon with the change in weather.

I can buy a 72 peat pellet hot house by a competitor, with the pellets included, mind you, at a big-box retailer, for about $7.HOWEVER, that one only has a 2-inch transparent plastic top on it - and this one has 7 inches of growing room. In addition, this has some simple but effective adjustable vents in the hood - both ends and in the top - which are useful to control the humidity level.Since I had to go buy the pellets anyway, I got the 2-inch hothouse they came in.

5.0,"These Fiskars 9210 Long-Handled Swivel Grass Shears will literally save wear and tear on your back and knees both when you have any small yard trimming to do. These are not made for grass trimming around the perimeter of a large yard, as your hand would wear out from squeezing the handle. We use the electric string trimmer to trim the grass against the fence around our entire yard. As for all the other trimming in the yard- around the house, the garage, around bushes, trees, sidewalks, the patio, gardens, corners and utility poles, these Fiskars Grass Shears are just perfect!These shears are meant to trim grass and lighter plants, not anything thick, but since grass is always growing around everything in our yard, they get a constant workout.  The 3 foot height is just perfect- no bending or stooping ever. There is an orange turning device on the blades, allowing you to turn these blades to any angle you need. The blades actually turn a full 360 degrees. The 5 inch blades are fully hardened for long lasting sharpness and also lock for storage or when you are turning them. We noticed they do come with a slight oil on the blades themselves.I contacted Fiskars and asked about any maintenance for the blades, and they told me they should stay sharp for years, but you could add a sharper edge to them in time with a hand sharpener- similar to a lawn mower blade sharpener. Cleaning and lightly oiling them when they become dirty will keep them cutting perfect.  Fiskars actually has a lifetime guarantee against any defects in workmanship.  For under $35.00, these are a must have for saving my back and knees with the constant maintenance of yard trimming. These are not just for older people, as I've always had bad knees- and I wish I had known about these years ago!The thought of trimming all the constant grass around the yard made me not want to do it. I'd have to get out my small shears, my knee pad or a stool to sit on- depending on the height of the grass or weeds. Afterwards, I'd need my heating pad and linament for my aching back and knees, not to mention Aleve or some other pain killer. Spending so much time in pain made me dread trimming. Now, I just grab the Fiskars Long Handled Shears- stand, trim and that's it.

3.0,"First, this looks great out of the box. You get a solid ring, four legs (nicely packed in rolled corrugated cardboard so that they don't rub together in transit), a brass bowl, a grate, a screen top, a ring holder for the top, and tongs. (You also get a hexagonal Allen wrench, so no tools are necessary.) To assemble the thing, you have to screw the ring holder onto the grate. That was easy and took less than a minute. (The screw to hold the holder onto the screen comes screwed into the ring so that it's obvious which screw to use.) The next thing to do is attach the four legs. Here is where I ran into difficulty.The legs have two screw holes, and the instructions seem to suggest that all the legs are identical. (The instructions do not say as much directly, but the legs are not distinguished either. The instructions state simply that you have four legs, nine screws, and so forth. I was able to attach the first two legs fairly easily but I couldn't get the next two on. The holes did not align properly. After spending about 15 minutes struggling with the legs, I gave up. But a bit later, I tried again and rotated the legs. I removed the first two and was able to get the four legs to fit. Well, three of them fit well, and one doesn't fit well, but at least I was able to attach it.The end result is a fire pit that wobbles since the legs don't seem to match up well. The pit works (and quickly loses its sheen), but it does wobble. The problems I had assembling the pit may have been my fault, but I did read the directions as best I could.",1402704000,2014-06-14

My review is mostly based on the use of the this kit WITH the 2nd panel added to it, although I will try to touch on it's function as a standalone kit as well.This is the coolest thing I've added to my backpacking gear list in a long time.Pros:-Comes with a battery charger and 4 NiMH AA batteries, as well as an adapter for AAA's (but it does not come with AAA batteries).-The battery charger has a USB output, so you can use the AA's to charge your USB-chargeable devices. from it. Goal Zero also recommends that you use the battery pack as a &#34;buffer&#34; between the solar panel(s) and your device, to allow your device to receive a consistant charge.-2 panels daisy-chained together provided more than enough power to charge my Samsung Note 3, even without using the battery pack for a &#34;buffer&#34;. Each panel can be expected to provide about 1 amp at 5v under average sunlight, so 2 panels (2 amps) can charge in iPad at the same rate as a standard wall-charger.-Folds up flat, very easy to pack in a backpack. Stays closed using built-in rare earth magnets.-Very well constructed, and looks nice. You can tell the engineers thought of everything!-Each panel includes parachute cord loops on the sides, so you can use carabiners or string to hang it from something, or hang them from each other if you have more than 1.Cons:-It weighs a lot, and is probably not an effective replacement for disposable batteries during short journeys. On my home scale, the panel by itself weighs 17oz without the detachable cables, and the battery charger weighs 2.75oz with the AAA adapter. Add to that to the weight of a second panel, 4 AA's and 4 AAA's, and suddenly your power system now weighs around 3lbs. For a long journey, it is absolutely worth the weight to me, but for a weekend outing, I think I'll stick with just carrying some spare batteries.-The pigtail cable that allows you to daisy-chain multiple panels together is too short in my opinion, and it is permanently installed in the solar panel so it can't be replaced, but you might be able to make a pigtail extension cable for it.Overall impression:Probably not good for short outings, due to the weight. A few spare batteries would weigh significantly less than this charging kit. However, for long outings, this is one of the coolest electronic devices I've seen. It will make sure your GPS, phone, camera, etc. will never run out of juice no matter how long you're gone!",1387843200,2013-12-24
5.0,I was pleased to receive the bird feeder and see that it was exactly as advertised.  I will be using it this winter to feed all the birds that have become used to grabbing a snack at my home.,1402963200,2014-06-17

4.0,"EDIT: Okay, it took two months for the birds to really notice this feeder, but now it's their preferred feeder in my yard. I've got this one, a mealworm feeder, and I had one of those seed blocks as well, and the birds basically just ignore everything else and go just for this. Granted, they're all different food types, but I've had no real hits on the mealworm feeder and the seed block was pretty much ignored, whereas this feeder with black oil sunflower seeds is now a huge hit. Since ""the awakening"" when they finally all noticed it was there I have observed the following species actually feeding from this feeder (I have only stocked it with black oil sunflower seeds): house finch, pine siskin, lesser goldfinch, white-crowned sparrow, song sparrow, dark-eyed junco, western scrub-jay (poking around on the ground looking for fallen seed), and mourning dove, and have observed tons more birds in my yard though not at the feeder at least when I've been looking.Now that I can give a proper review of this feeder, here are some pros and cons:Pros-Easy to fill, just pull back the lid and pour the seed into the top! :-P-Easy to hang, just push the lid all the way down so that the clamp on top tightens around the cord, and you're good to go-Easy to disassemble, just pull back the lid and pull the plastic panels straight out through the top and you can individually clean themCons-Seed has a tendency to get stuck in the corners when it gets low, where it is very difficult for birds to reach-I wish the top were actually removable, as it would make it even easier to clean the metal part if I weren't trying to maneuver around the lid-Cleaning can be a pain sometimes (because of the non-removable lid) but it's not that bad-I wish this had some kind of catch tray on the outside between the perch and the actual food. It varies, but sometimes I can put seed in here and it'll last for several days; other times I put seed in here and it lasts for less than a day. Where has all the seed gone? On the ground below, where the birds just hop around eating it. I just have a feeling that if there were at least a tray on the outside there would be less seed falling everywhere as the birds eat out of the feeder, and it might slow down the emptying process.Note: Please be aware of your obligations if you decide to take up bird feeding and get this (or another) feeder. Unless you are in an area with extreme weather and therefore few areas with suitable forage, then it's probably not necessary to constantly maintain a steady supply of seed. In normal circumstances birds probably know other areas they can feed if they aren't getting new seed from you right away. HOWEVER, it is important for you to make sure that your feeder(s) remains clean and that you periodically clean up the hulls or leftover seed on the ground underneath so as to reduce the risk of transmitting diseases, especially after a rain or a series of foggy days when seed may have a higher chance of molding and going bad. Additionally, be aware that high amounts of bird activity may draw predators into your yard. Since the birds started really going crazy over this feeder I have observed not just the neighbor's cat sitting underneath the feeder in my yard, but I also came home one day to find a Cooper's hawk sitting in my yard in front of the feeder as well. While I was thrilled to find the hawk in my yard, you do need to be aware that songbirds are food for larger animals, and you may get these animals coming into your yard if they see or hear all the activity.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've got a ton of bird activity in the area surrounding my house, and I really expected them to flock to this feeder. I stocked it with black oil sunflower seed but unfortunately after several weeks I've got no activity whatsoever. I know the seed is fine because I've also spread it on the ground and have found that it gets eaten, but the seed in the feeder is completely ignored. Another reviewer suggested that maybe the birds that are on every side of the feeder are deterring other birds from coming closer, and that could be the case. For now I'll have to rate this down, but since I can't be conclusive I'll leave it at 3 stars.",1351123200,2012-10-25
4.0,"This Rubbermaid deck box is lightweight plastic.  It comes with a hole on the lid to attach a padlock.Assembly was easy.  I didn't like having to punch out the tabs with a hammer and flathead screwdriver, but it wasn't tremendously difficult.  The pieces snapped in like they should.  I had to have my husband help me with a few of the screws, because the plastic had indentations for the screws but no holes.I'd have liked this deck box to be a little bigger (my fault for not measuring).  The back and seat cushions for my four chairs did not all fit.  In fact, I could only get the back cushions in.It's a sturdy box.  I'm not sure if it leaks.  If it survives the next rain, I'll try remember to come back to update.______________________UPDATE 11/29/12: This box still looks new after more than a year. It's raining today and I checked.

4.0,"Actually, streaky windows bug me.  Our house has some floor to ceiling windows facing the backyard and between the kids having squirt gun wars and the cat scratching at the windows trying to come in and eat dinner 6 times per day our windows are always kind of streaky.  Every once in awhile I would feel some inspirations and go at the windows with some Windex and paper towels but they never really looked that great when I was done (still streaky) and it was a lot of effort (and paper towels).So I was more than willing to put this Karcher through the paces.  Plus the male side of me was kind of excited to add another motorized tool to my collection - the more the better.  So this little shop-vac for windows actually works.  I cleaned and squeegie vaccumed my big rear windows and they look way better than using Windex.  Pretty quick to use and very little streaking - a bit of runnage in the areas to the side of the squeegie.So I like this product.  However, around the same time I also began using the ""e-cloth"" that I purchased on Amazon based upon rave reviews.  The e-cloth is low tech - it's just a microfiber cloth and it costs $15. The thing is the e-cloth gets my windows absolutely spotless streak-free with less effort than even this Karcher vac - plus cheaper, no recharging, less noise, etc.  My wife was impressed with the Karcher but she could absolutely not believe how well the little e-cloth worked.So in summary, I definitely recommend this Karcher vac over the old chemical methods such as Windex.  I would be using this Karcher now except for my e-cloth discovery.  4-stars for the Karcher in consideration of price-value and if you are allergic to e-cloth.",1358380800,2013-01-17

5.0,"Not as strong as my corded trimmer, but it certainly does the job well enough that I'm storing my corded trimmer in the attic as ""backup.""What I like:1.  TWO batteries!  Yay.  They're easy on / easy off, lightweight, and relatively quick to charge.2.  Convenient, easy-to-use adjustments. This unit is quite versatile.  With a quick squeeze, the base rotates 180 degrees and snaps into place, thus making edging a breeze.  Another quick squeeze at the base and it's back to being a 'regular' trimmer.  The height adjustment is also an excellent feature.  Lift a little lever and the unit easily adjusts for different lengths. This enables my 11-yr old daughter to adjust the unit shorter so she can get a decent angle for trimming.  She had a tough time getting a good angle using my taller corded trimmer.3.  Very lightweight overall, yet balanced and sturdy.4.  Trimmer wheel.  I've seen a few disparaging reviews about the wheel, but frankly, I think it makes trimming easier and more uniform, too. First, it's a godsend for helping my daughter make lawns look sharp in her new yard-care business (her previous work without such a guide was not pretty).  However, I love the wheel, too, as it makes edging a breeze.  I say if the wheel bothers you, be proactive and take it off!5.  I also like that the batteries work on other B & D products.  I have decided to get more B & D products that use these interchangable batteries, so there will be no more dealing with cords when I'm doing lawn care.  It will make things very convenient.What I don't like:As mentioned, it's not as powerful as my corded trimmer, but it still does the job and I'm quite happy with it.  So, if less power is my only complaint, I really have nothing to complain about.  :-)Five stars for sure.  I wish I'd bought one of these a long time ago.",1404518400,2014-07-05
3.0,"I like the idea of these traps, and I have to reiterate - as others have here - that they are lures to identify whether there is a problem, not a cure for a problem. Do note that the lures need to be replaced every 12 weeks.That said - cedarballs or mothballs may be a better solution. Sure, they smell, but they also repel. These traps don't repel, they alert.

4.0,"...I thought this was a canvas bucket with a handle and didn't realize it was a canvas wrap around for a 5 gallon 'homer' bucket, which is not included.Tip for putting it on, unlatch the velcro strap and remove it entirely so you can slip the wrap under the bucket handle, not over it.  That might be why some people are having the velcro or seams tear, if you wrap it right around the handle and then raise the handle, that would put more stress on the strap.Once I wound this under the handles as pictured in the amazon image on the product page, rerun the strap and secured the velcro it was snug enough to put a bunch of tools in the pockets.  Which are big enough for tools you'd use to manicure plants, as opposed to hand shovels and the like.  Look at the photo and you'll see some regular standard scissors in one of the pockets, that should give you some scale.So nice that I have a big bucket to put stuff in, not so nice that its really made for rather small tools, not so nice that I had to go buy a bucket but that's my fault.

5.0,"I came across this Gerber shovel in my Amazon recommendations recently.  I own the very same model that I bought at the LL Bean store in Freeport, Maine 2 years ago.  I was not as much of an Amazon shopper back then as I am today.  But I wish now that I was.  I paid $32 at LL Beans for this model, and that was 2 years ago.  At the time I remember them not having much of a selection, but this shovel seemed very well made, rugged, and easy to use.  I figured I could do a lot worse for the price.  As it turns out, I could have done a lot better. Forgetting the shellacking I took on the price of this shovel, I highly recommend you not only buy this model if you are in the market for one, but I also suggest you forget the shopping around and just buy it here.  This is probably the best quality folding shovel you will ever find for the price they are asking.  Especially, if you buy it as part of a package deal and get the free shipping thrown in.  If you are one that has ever visited hiking or outdoor gear stores than you know how expensive any survival type equipment can be.  They have a fool proof way of drawing you into spending as many bucks as you can on whatever it is they are offering by hammering home the point that it's your life and family you are talking about here.  The real truth is that a lot of people buy equipment that is far more expensive than they will ever have a reason to need, or even use at all.  As anyone that is an avid outdoor enthusiast knows, a folding camp shovel has lots of uses along on a camping or hiking trip.  Digging, prospecting, hammering, climbing, self defense, and even sometimes actual shoveling are all included on the list. Most folding shovels offered in retail outlets are not just expensive, but often time just too big.  This one folds down very compactly, and can be easily toted along with little room taken, or inconvenience met.  This Gerber model is in my opinion the perfect size and quality that most of us would ever have a reason to need along on a wilderness adventure.  Its solid, very rugged, a snap to extend and compact, and after two years of owning it, it is still going strong for me with little show for the wear.  I highly recommend the Gerber for your outdoor needs.  It is in my opinion all the shovel you should ever need, at the best price you will find...",1255564800,2009-10-15

4.0,"I really like the all-in-one construction of this unit. It comes completely assembled in a clam-shell package, and unfolds like an accordion. The lid is attached with two spring-loaded latches, which keeps the lid secure, and prevents squirrels from being able to lift the lid and dive right in. It holds a total of five pounds of seed, which has been lasting about two weeks -- based on squirrel and bird usage. This feeder only works well with sunflower or sunflower/safflower mixes.Filling could be slightly easier. Because of the accordion design, you need to hold the unit completely upright with one hand (or hang it at a suitable level), so you can fill it. Otherwise, it will just collapse. There are no instructions, so I'm guessing when I fill it, so maybe there is an easier solution. The design allows each of the three main chambers to fill before the seed will spill completely into the lower chamber. This is actually a smart design, because it also prevents squirrels from emptying the entire unit easily. The lid cannot be completely removed, but it is cut in such a way that you can swing it completely off the top for easy access to filling.At the bottom of the unit, there is a tray that will collect the seed that exits several openings. You can also add additional seed to this tray as a ""starter"" for the visitors. In addition to the tray, there are two additional levels from which birds can perch to feed from the other two main chambers. I've seen birds actively using the feeder -- starlings and cardinals, for example. Mourning Doves are feeding from the seed spilled to the ground (as are the squirrels).Squirrels are able to latch themselves onto the mesh of the feeder. However, the design keeps them from draining the seed quickly. It seems they are only able to remove the seed from the tray -- and as they do, they seem to be in an awkward position that keeps them from doing it comfortably and effectively. They seem to have a really difficult time removing the seed from the mesh. Also, the internal design keeps at least half the seed in each of the lower two chambers from spilling over into the bottom tray, so the only way for squirrels to remove the seeds is through the mesh, which they seem to have a problem doing. Overall, I'd rate this design as a ""B"" for squirrel prevention.I like this because it is attracting birds, can't be easily emptied, and holds a decent amount of seed. It's sturdy and fashionable. I'd recommend this if you want to start attracting birds to your yard, and don't mind sharing some of the seed with squirrels.",1368316800,2013-05-12

With the traditional ones, I caught my husband as often as I caught a mouse, and one time our dog got her nose snapped in it. (Don't worry, I did catch and release with the husband).We were looking for an effective method that wasn't as dangerous for our pets, that didn't snap our fingers, and most of all that worked. Living in an area near farms, the struggle with mice will be continuous - and I don't really want a farm cat to patrol our yard.These are very effective, you slide the band onto the trap, then place it in the holder. I don't know if it strangles them or breaks their neck, but it works. Best of all, it doesn't leave them mangled in the trap. Since there are no mangled pieces of mouse to worry about, the only thing we have to replace on this model is the little bands - it comes with enough to kill 10 mice.It is simple enough that I don't have to count on my husband to do the traps, I can load them myself!

Most traditional weed and feed you apply at a time when they can't do both and that is a waste for you and a harm to the environment.I can say this product was very easy to apply.

5.0,"I actually have five of these things.  I have one near each of our outside faucets coming out of our house (four) and I have one hanging in one of my sheds where I keep my gardening stuff and some of my beloved junk.  These garden hose hangers meet my needs perfectly.  They are:Metal and extremely strong for what they are.  They are not plastic so there is no danger of their turning brittle and cracking from exposure to the sun and are much stronger than plastic.They are simple and unobtrusive.  I am not a person who likes a lot of fancy yard ornaments.  These blend in quite well with their surroundings.For what you get, they are quite cost effective.  They cost less than some of the plastic gizmos I find.They are easy to install.They hold up to 100 feet of standard yard hose...even more if you want to push it.They do the job for which I bought them for, i.e. keeping my garden hoses organized, out of the way and safe from my lawn tractor.  (I have a long history of shredding hoses as I do much daydreaming while mowing - I sort of go into a Zen like trance and am pretty oblivious to what ever happens to be in my way.)Now there is a couple of concerns you might consider...nothing is perfect you know.  These include:They do NOT come with the screws required to mount them.  For me this was actually a good thing.  In another of my sheds - my ""work shop"" I have something like thirty or so large coffee cans filled with screws, bolts, nuts, washers and things I now not what are.  I was able to sift through these cans and find just the screws I needed.  I was then able to tell my wife, ""See, I told you this `stuff' would someday be useful and I am NOT a hoarder.""  I have been collecting this stuff for over 50 years now and it is gratifying each time I find a practical use for it. It is precious to me.These are metal.  Rather heavy metal I grant you, but never the less metal.  Metal in prone to rust.  I get around this my inspecting these thing every now and than and if I see any rust starting (normally where the paint has chipped), I simply hit it with a bit of sand paper and then spray paint it with a quality outdoor paint.I have mine mounted on 4x4s which I have placed in the ground and on the wall near the faucets.  In the shed, I have them screwed to a stud.I do have one of those large box type hose holders that allow you to roll the hose up which I keep near an outside faucet we have near the garden.  It must be replaced this year because last fall our 92 year old neighbor lady decided she wanted to burn her leaves in a 300 mile an hour wind (that is an exaggeration of course) and the fire got away from her (Duh) and took out half my orchard along with the hose box, hose and a leaf raker  I used it on the back of my lawn tractor.  I was just grateful that it did not take out the barns, sheds and indeed, house.Anyway, this is a good hose hanger and actually a very good buy at the price listed here. I paid about five dollars more at the local hardware.  Not frills here...just a good practical and well built item.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",1332201600,2012-03-20

5.0,"This is one of the nicest looking feeders I've ever had. The way it is built, allows the birds to get their food without the housing being accessible for wasps/hornets to decide they've found new nesting material for their babies. This feeder holds an entire 10lb bag of bird seed - so if you're going to hang this on a shepherd's crook, make sure it is securely anchored in the ground. It makes my crook bow ever-so-slightly from the weight - but as the birds consume the food, that's a short-term issue. The feeder definitely presents a challenge to the few squirrels we get. They can get so little at a time, it makes far more sense to them to go to our squirrel feeders where they can eat like kings without consuming ridiculous amounts of bird food. I really like this feeder, and the birds do, too! We get a lot of Tufted Titmice that love to hang upside down while feeding. They are quite comical on this feeder.",1367798400,2013-05-06

This is convenient if you don't have a spreader; if you do, you can just unscrew the lid and pour out as much as you want.I use Shake'n'feed every year because it's convenient, well packaged, and it works and saves precious garden time.

5.0,"I had picked this from the Vine selection because I have a few areas in my back yard with sand.  One for temporary pools I set up in the summer for my young son, and the other area for the play set / swing set.  I get a lot of small animals back there, rabbits, squirrels, etc, and got tired of animal droppings and such.  So I figured this was worth a shot.We had a few days without rain in the forecast, so I applied it one afternoon when I got home from work.  The motorized pump is a fantastic answer - I don't know how many times I've gone around my yard with standard spray bottles even for things as random as weeds, and the fingers and forearm feel the burn after a bit.  And that's just for spots here and there.  Doing a larger area would not be something I'd look forward to.  So this worked great, once you got past the initial priming.I sprayed just the areas I wanted them kept out of, and surprisingly over the next couple days they really did avoid those areas in the back yard.  So I decided to spray again after a rain storm we had, and this time I extended it to more areas, including around the front yard perimeter.  I have some careless cat owner living in the area whose cat must spend more time around my yard than it does at home.  And we have a lot of people walking dogs in our neighborhood, some of whom aren't as careful about where their pets do their business as I'd like them to be.  And this has also helped some with those as well.  I haven't seen the cat even once after spraying around.  Dogs tend to stay on the sidewalk.I don't have any deer in this area to keep away, so I can't attest to the effectiveness against them, but it really does seem to work well for other animals, even ones I hadn't anticipated.  And the power sprayer makes this just a breeze to apply - just make sure you're pointing it WITH the wind when you apply it, don't want to be getting it on yourself...",1347062400,2012-09-08

3.0,"I had the chance to try this grill out, and having bought a number of grills in the past trying to find the right one I took the opportunity to check this one out. Overall, if I were to give it a buy, try or don't buy my rating on this would be a try and here is why.The grill itself is not the cheap. It's approx $300 at the time of this review and for that same price you could hit your big box hardware store and get a number of grills with larger cooking area, heavier quality lid to retain heat and may even have it assembled. Now what you won't get is a really neat looking grill. I mean this thing is sleek. I love the look of the grill and the functionality of how they hide the propane tank under it with a door on a hinge instead of just an exposed back like most grills use.I like the fact that the handles on the side of this grill are designed for multi use, you can for instance hang your cooking utensils on them. You can use them to wheel the grill around or you can even slide the lid to the grill on either side into the handle to create a small wind screen.This is the first grill I have seen with a function like this.So if it looks great, and has nice looking features what is wrong with it?Overall the grill is made out of quality materials from what I can tell. The door that holds the propane take is decent thickness, the handles are firm and don't flex when pulled. But here's the 2 main problems I have.The grill comes with cheap, very cheap plastic wheels. They work ok but I found that just wheeling the grill around the garage the wheels started to scuff pretty bad. As soon as I ran over anything it actually caused small dents in the wheel. The quality of them is just horrendous, I think they should have splurged and given an upgrade to the wheels to make them stronger and more durable. Other grills I have owned have had stronger, harder plastic wheels.The other issue is the quality of the lid. The lid is a HUGE piece of any grill. It's what holds the heat in and if it's thick you can retain a lot more heat making your propane be more efficient. It also does NOT have any type of hinge on it. You pick the lid up and have to put it somewhere out of your way. The grill does feature lid slits in the handles but that really isn't that easy to use when you are quickly trying to get the lid off to flip your food. Yes it works, but on more than one occasion the lid actually fell out of the mount when I was trying to use it. Nothing like a hot lid falling near your feet. Then there is the lid quality. The lid on every grill I have owned has been thick, you can't flex or bend it. This grill however the lid feels extremely cheap. In fact mine was bent when I unboxed it, Not a problem because it was so thin I could actually easily bend it back into shape. This lid should be much higher quality, it should not bend at all. Plus if you look at most grills the handle to the lid is on the front and it rotates upwards for a reason, lots of heat could burn you. Weber grills feature a lid similar to this one where you lift straight up but the difference is they have air vents you can open and shut to control heat. On this grill there are slits cut into the lid so if you are cooking you really should be wearing gloves when putting the lid on or off of this grill (especially off) so that you don't burn yourself.It's a neat design and that is really what you are buying here. Yes it functions, but there are so many things I don't like about this grill. If they would improve the quality of the wheels I'd probably bump this up to 4 stars. If they had a better quality lid with vents you could open/close it would get 5 stars. But at this price point to me there are several other options you could go with.I will add, the grill does assemble easily, took me around 30 minutes. It does heat up quickly and it does function.",1400112000,2014-05-15
5.0,"The house is clean and sparkling so when they sent this I thought, 'Oh great, what will I do with it?'  Well a friend of mine in Texas is familiar with this product and was stopping by last weekend and wanted to know all about my Vine membership with Amazon...and of course if could I get him on ( and for all the Vine members out there that here this week in week out...the answer is no btw...it's invitation only as far as I know)...but I was showing him some recent Vine products I was trying out currently and the Krud Kutter was among them and I explained the situation since I had just had the House professionally cleaned, and Bill, that's his name, said, 'Well heck, little buddy (don't ask), this makes a preemo driveway cleaner back home and you should try it'.  Well he and Agnes drove away Sunday which just happened to be a sunny dry day and I thought why not!!

5.0,"I was somewhat skeptical that this would be worth its price and that nothing could surpass the traditional way of cleaning windows and mirrors.Upon use, I was pleasantly surprised.Pros:It is simpler to assemble and use; as well as empty than one might think.The reach of the cleaner enabled me to clean a very large bathroom mirror that I would have had needed to get a step stool to navigate.Not a heavy unit.Minimum use of paper towels.A clean and beautiful result.Cons:Yes, it appears expensive but let us start to calculate the cost of paper towels over a period of time.Reservoir does need to be emptied and dried out before storage.Does need to be charged prior to use.All in all, I believe the unit is worth it.  It does prompt a clean factor in that once it is charged you will find yourself going thru your home to clean a window, or mirror or whatever.Use hints:Be generous with the spray of the window cleaner used...(suggestion Windex)Learn to manipulate the Karcher to reach all points and corners.Of course, you will still need paper towels or microfiber cloths to clean inner sills.

5.0,"I think this is a good value really - don't make the mistake of comparing it to a water soluable food - this is the type of food that you put out and it works for about 12 weeks/3 months - this provides extended feeding - so 1 or 2 applications, depending where you are, might get you through the growing season.I've used this in my soil mix to start pansies with, and they are doing great.  The iron content helps the leaves stay nice and green, and they are growing much faster than when I've not used it.  (I used Jungle Grow/Hyponex, instead of the more expensive potting soils that already have fertilizer in them to test this in my greenhouse- and this is really just as good.)I've also used this on pansy seedlings, in pansy seed starter mix, on full grown pansies, petunias, dianthus, and marigolds, and it really seems to encourage healthy plants and abundant, blooming.  I saw an increase in blooms just a few days after application.  I like to apply mine right before I know it will rain.  Wait 2-3 days, boom- Flower bomb!The extra nitrogen boost really helps keep flowers on the plants.I've also used this on very young cucumber and tomato plants, and they both seemed to like it, with vigorous plant growth.",1399075200,2014-05-03
1.0,"I received this Yard Butler Sprinkler Stand as part of Vine product reviewing. I had read a review of the unit before I ordered it about the threads in the stand being a problem.

As I tried to put in the sprinkler that I had just purchased, I was very careful, I found that the sprinkler would not go in straight and the sprinkler end thread was being ruined. I looked at the threads in the Yard Butler and they were  clearly not tapped properly. If I would have continued it would have ruined my sprinkler head. It was not a question of lining them up, the Yard butler threads were bad.Since I have the tools and knowledge of threading  and tapping pipe, I re-did the Yard butler threads and it accepted the sprinkler and works fine.

4.0,"This product works as advertised.  It will catch/kill a mouse about as effectively as a standard ""snap"" mousetrap.  They both use the same principles: bait it with peanut butter, set it, and catch the mouse.The advantage this has over a typical mousetrap is that you do not have to view the ""execution"" and can just cleanly toss away the whole unit afterward.  Another advantage over a standard mousetrap is that, since it is all enclosed, you need not worry about your dog, cat, etc. hurting themselves on the trap.The downside to this is it can become fairly expensive.  If you are going to keep these in a garage, basement, etc. just as a precaution, that's one thing.  But if you get mice in the house, typically a field/house mouse is going to have a nest of 10-20 who come to visit you.  That would be a lot of these disposable traps, and at more than $4 a pop it'll add up quickly.As far as performance, this is about as effective as a regular bait mouse trap.  Some reviews have commented on its failure and small opening.  My opinion is as follows:There are times when a mouse will eat the peanut butter bait, but not trip the trap, or manage to dodge it.  That goes for standard snap traps as well as this one.  I have used the black plastic Tom Cat mouse traps in the past and found they work well.  But even with those, I'd say about 1 out of 10 or 15 times I'd return to find no peanut butter and the trap either untripped or unoccupied.  If you are looking for 100%, you can go with a chemical trap, but that comes with a whole other suite of issues.....pets, dead mice in your walls, etc.With a snap trap, enclosed or not, accept that once in a while the mouse will dine for free at the trap, but you'll get him the next day.As for size, the opening is about 1 inch on this Victor trap.  Small to you and me, but ample for a mouse.I have used these in my garage to intercept visitors before they make their way into my house.  They work fine.  I happen to prefer the standard traps.  There is usually very little clean-up, and standard ""snap"" traps are reusable (depending on the mess they made), where this is meant as a one-shot deal.  Even if you dispose of the snap traps, they still cost less than half this enclosed unit.So I would say, if you simply do not want to deal with seeing your rodent victim, or just want to lay a trap or two as a precaution, this product would be for you.  However, if you are trying to get rid of a nest, a standard snap trap will work just as well but cost much less.",1286841600,2010-10-12

3.0,"This window bird feeder works, but only stood up to 1 season of use for me before requiring repairs.  It's flimsy plastic, so you get what you pay for.Pros:- Plastic is clear, so watching birds is easy- The roof does help keep the bird seed dry- The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter- The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water- The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raids.Cons:- The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam.  Through normal use, these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate.  Luckily, super glue works well.- The opening is only big enough for a single bird, in my experience, without squabbles.- A single fall, if the suction cups give out, will likely result in a broken feederI think it's just o.k. because it is easily damaged and didn't permit more than one bird to feed at a time.  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder.  It's more accessible by squirrels, but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feeder.Tip:  To increase suction cup strength, clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup.  It increases holding power significantly.",1404604800,2014-07-06
4.0,"This is a great Animal Repellent that uses Pepper to keep areas safe. It can last up to 30 days depending on your weather. Also any digging, watering or anything that disrupts to ground will affect the coverage and duration.It works by affecting the animals sense of smell and taste with hot pepper and by getting it on their skin and in their eyes. In fact, one way to use this to take some table scraps and cover them with it. Once that skunk or opossum tastes this hot pepper, it will go elsewhere for it's next meal. Also keep in mind that open sources of water and food are what draw in such animals, so if those are still present, you will get other animals coming to the location.This also works to keep cats from using your flower beds as a bathroom, you can shake it over your birdseed to keep squirrels out as birds can't taste hot pepper and it is a non-chemical way to protect your vegetable garden from animals eating your crops.",1350172800,2012-10-14
4.0,"I've been using this for approximately 5 weeks now.  As a baseline, I am coming from using a pair of Homelite 2-Stroke trimmers for 20 years. These Gas trimmers were straight shaft, dual .80 lines. They started reasonably well despite some occasional flooding.  But it was always somewhat of a ""Special Effort"" to use them, an effort that made me tend to skip a week.This 36V BD is just ""push the botton and go"". It is so easy to use, that I may pick it up anytime during the week...even when I am not specifically mowing the grass.  It does not Rip, Snort, and Tear like the Gas Trimmer. I think mostly because of the single .65 line.  It is a ""Kinder, Gentler"" trimmer, but it gets the job done.  It takes just a little longer than using the gas trimmer.  A benefit of this Gentler cut is that it does not splatter my shins and shoes with as much debris.  I now feel OK trimming with shorts on.  With the Gas, I always wore Jeans to keep my shins from getting all nicked up. This Gentler cut also is more forgiving for mistakes.This does take a couple of rounds of practice to get used to it, depending on what you were replacing it with.  Took me a couple times to ""Edge"" straight, but the end results look great.  I think the lower head end is a bit on the heavy side.  The battery at the top helps balance it.So, it performs well.  How about the battery life?  I have 10,000 sq. ft of yard.  But I have to do fences, landscape trimming, sidewalk/driveway edging, etc.  If I ""Just Trim"", I can get done easily on one charge.  If I try to Trim and do extensive sidewalk and driveway edging at the same time, I tend to need to move into the second battery from my B&D; Blower.  But that's OK by me for the convenience.The charger is fast.  I have two, but only opened the one.  BTW, the Blower is much weaker than the Trimmer.  Convenient, sure, but not very powerful...(read my review)The Trimmer is a great tool (and toy!)",1370476800,2013-06-06

Granted, I trimmed my hedges for about 20 minutes straight and was finished.I also have a 18v NiCad Black & Decker Hedge Trimmer - NHT518 cordless, and this Toro kicks it's butt.  It is stronger, and quieter.  I only wish it came with a sturdier blade cover.  The blade cover is flimsy, but does it's job.  You won't be disappointed in this trimmer.  It comes fully assembled, and all you should do is charge the battery first before using.  5 stars all the way.",1336608000,2012-05-10
4.0,"I must confess that my initial attempt to put this together was a miserable failure. The end product LOOKED like a H-bird feeder but it was leaking like a sieve - and this where a star goes away because meaningful assembly instructions are largely missing. Well... a couple of days later my wife took over and... it worked. It took the birds only a few hours to notice it and, ever since, they've been all over it, sometimes 3 or 4 flying around and our kids love watching them.To make the long story short: it's not exactly a 'high end' feeder, the materials are cheap, it looks cheap if you care about the looks but it holds its water well and the Hummingbirds seem to appreciate. We've replaced the sugar-water several times already and nothing broke yet.",1280188800,2010-07-27
4.0,"QUICK SUMMARY:  This is the 2nd time I've bought this pole saw.  My first one broke after two years of use, but it was useful enough to me that I was willing to buy it a 2nd time.  Read my review to learn what NOT to do.  Recommended!My first Black and Decker pole saw broke when the screwhole threads inside the metal frame (these are the screwholes you use to make the chain taut) somehow got stripped after I tried tightening the screws once.  Apparently, you have to be CAREFUL not to overtighten these screws, or else you'll damage the screwhole threads, and the screws meant for tightening the chain won't tighten anymore, so your chain becomes too loose to use, so you can't use it anymore.  My lesson learned is your lesson learned!I also should admit, too, that I pushed this pole saw beyond its intended means.  By that, I mean that I was cutting big limbs off my front yard's black olive tree, the largest of which was probably about 10"" in diameter.  Yes, it's really intended to be used to cut much smaller branches and limbs, but I had to cut big limbs off my tree before hurricane season!What I like:- it's reasonably lightweight, though hard to use when you're stretching on a step ladder- no electric wires to accidentally cut, or that unplug from your saw!- the battery keeps a reasonably long charge- the chain is easy to tighten and replace- it's relatively inexpensiveWhat I don't like:- you have to manually oil the change every so often- you can overtighten the screws bringing permanent damage to your saw if you're not careful!- you have to assemble the wand fully to use the saw; I wish you could just plug-in the battery directly or almost directly into the saw so you more easily cut-up the fallen branches into smaller piecesFinal tip:  Take the time to read the manufacturer's advice on how to properly store and care for your battery.  I didn't, and my older saw's battery suffered because I didn't follow the charging instructions correctly.Recommended!",1265155200,2010-02-03

5.0,"I prefer this catch and release method for taking care of nuisance critters. I have no desire to kill an animal foraging for food. Someday I might be out there foraging myself.It's highly recommended that you wear thick impenetrable gloves while handling this cage with a critter inside, as most critters have sharp teeth and claws and will be frightened and try to scratch at you when you go to pick this up. We lay an old sheet over the top of the cage to comfort the animal as we transport to a new location.Whatever you do, make sure you check your trap a couple times a day. Morning and evening. It's inhumane to leave an animal trapped for more than a half day in cold or hot weather.The trap itself works great and it's hard to imagine how a critter could get out, once trapped inside, but really tiny critters might not be heavy enough to engage the trap door and really big critters could just get stuck, but not contained. We've had no problems thus far and are relocating raccoons that have taken a liking to our veggie and fruit garden.

4.0,"This Havahart Easy Set Trap is a good choice for those needing to humanly remove small critters from their property. This is the perfect size for small rabbits and just about any sized squirrels. We also have theHavahart 1030 Live Animal Two-Door Rabbit, Squirrel, Skunk, and Mink Cage Trap, which is a somewhat larger two-door trap and is better for slightly larger pests.Using this trap is very straight forward due to the clever design of the trapping mechanism and it works reasonably well right out of the box, but it can be made more sensitive by following the advice of other reviewers and placing a 3/8"" block under the handle when setting the trap (see picture in ""Customer Images""). Be sure to read the information on bait selection and placement, since it does need to be customized for the type of critter you are after. I like placing the main bait in hole under the trap's trigger plate.Remember that these are wild creatures and should be treated as such. Wearing gloves is a good idea when freeing the captured pest as a bite or scratch from a rabid animal can be very serious. Rabbits can inflict fairly serious wounds with their claws, especially to young children (seriously, we raised them when I was growing up).Recommended!CFH",1341532800,2012-07-06

I initially struggled using this product since I am an animal lover, but my yard is getting wrecked and I'm tired of having all my hard work get destroyed. I also also tired of large amounts of poop in my garage, all over my shelving.This unit is very easy to use - though I really wish the back had an opening. I'm always so paranoid to stick my hand in there to load the bait, even with the item turned off. I take out a battery when I load the bait, just to be sure I don't get zapped. LOL A ""back door"" that opened for easy bait loading would be much appreciated! I'm using peanut butter as bait.I do like that this kills the pest quickly, humanely and cleanly. There's no blood, etc. Just tip the device into a yard waste bag and load bat again. I was doing the catch and release method with Havahart, but got tired of giving chipmunks a ride to the local park, wasting gas and time.For the money, I'm happy!

4.0,"Arrived quickly and in one piece.  The bottle is quite heavy but the jury is still out as to whether this is colored red or truly red glass - time will tell.  I did fill it and hang it in an ""out of the way"" area where I've never fed the hummers before.  Within hours - they were at this feeder in a continuous flow.As for the design - when you remove the bottom (feeding ports), it comes off in two pieces.  The feeding ports are metal on a metal housing.  That just slips onto the screw part of the bottle.  The bottom (round part shown in photo) is actually plastic.  Not only is that disappointing but it's harder than it should be to screw back onto the bottle and tighten.  The last drawback that I can think of - it's big.  If you don't have a lot of hummers eating, don't fill it completely.  And especially in the sun because you'll be throwing away more juice than the birds can drink.  It's not that expensive with sugar and water but it's a pain with that sticky water!In closing - it looks brilliant in the sun and the birds seem to have no trouble eating from it.

5.0,"Simple, ingenious, lightweight, reusable pot filler, which promotes plant drainage without the weight of rocks or old broken pots pieces! I inadvertently was sent theGarden Genius Products Lightweight Pot Filler, 11.5 Inchfor review through Amazon's Vine which I review.  At under $5 the lightweight product is a nice alternative to the significantly more costly durable pot filler disc and will allow you to ""test"" the product line. On the other hand, if you need durability and convenience, the Durable Pot Filler Disc may better suit. The original prices were expensive but they are now discounted considerably. If you are more ambitious and want better economy, take a look at their large size rollGarden Genius GG-ROLL-1 Durable Pot Filler Roll, 12-Inch x 52-Inch. The bigger the pot--the bigger the benefit of all of these products. Losing 3 inches of rocks on a pot with an 11-inch bottom is a nice weight reduction and a big help if you have to move the pot around.3M provides a website and customer service line for questions. So of course I called them because the packaging did not state if the filler was food safe. Could I plant vegetables, herbs and other food in a pot with it without the composite chemicals migrating and leaching into the dirt and plants I intend to eat?The 3M lady explained the pot filler is made from PET plastic used to made soda pop bottles (she spelled it polybehylene terephthalate). I was told that it is food safe will not contaminate either the food plants or soil. The filler is not treated with other chemicals. So to my mind, it is better than using packaging peanuts.Roots can grow into the material over time especially in a shallow pot. The filler should not compact unless one over packs the dirt, which an experienced gardener wouldn't do anyway.  It is recyclable and reusable.Searching the Internet I learned that the PET polymer is considered safe by the FDA for ""indirect"" contact with food products. I also read that ""since bacteria can grow in virtually any packaging material if a food or beverage is stored in conditions suitable for bacterial growth...it is best to clean a [PET] container with hot soapy water and to dry thoroughly before reuse.""What I glean is: Yes, I can plant vegetables and herbs using this 3M pot filler. And even though I live in an area where fruits and vegetables grow year round, I will wash with hot soapy water, and dry it at least once a year. Small inconvenience for being able to lift and move a container around the yard for best growing conditions!Happy planting!",1312329600,2011-08-03

This is a nice selection of veggies and herbs and it comes with plant fertilizer to help out along with good instructions.  Actually anyone can do this it's so simple.  They were easy as pie to plant and the shell is made biodegradable so it will only add to help fertilize the plants later on as it rots and creates more compost.  Most see items will take the next year so the tomatoes and peppers will have to wait for spring.

3.0,"The repellent works, at least short term. I used it on tomato plants because the ground squirrels were getting all the ripe tomatoes. After I used it, I got some tomatoes too. But the product wears off quickly (at least off tomato plants even though I never intentionally wet the leaves of the plant).The main problems I had -- and thus the 3-star rating -- were the difficulty of using the battery powered spray handle, the tendency of the tube to clog, and the frequency with which the plastic bottle itself fell over whenever I set it down on the uneven ground in the field. As I said, the liquid repellent itself is fairly effective in the short run. But the delivery system makes the whole thing unworkable for me.  A wider bottom on the plastic container would help.  An option to use manual effort to activate the sprayer would help.  I went through 2 sets of batteries in short order which added to the cost of using the repellent.It's just all too complicated and imperfect as is.

When they arrived it was near time to cook dinner, so I had an opportunity to use them in a real cooking situation.As promised, you can grab a hot pan or baking sheet from the oven without any discomfort, and the textured surface firmly grips the slipperiest objects. In fact, I used them to actually turn over meat that I was broiling just to see if they were everything the product description claimed. They are. I also plucked a potato out of a boiling pot to test it in a more dynamic environment than the inside of an oven. No discomfort.While these are amazing and a lot safer than regular oven mitts, there are a few issues of which you need to be aware. Foremost is I do not have big hands by any stretch of the imagination and had to pull these on almost like you would for surgical gloves. Once I managed to wiggle my hands into them they were comfortable and gave me the flexibility to pick up most kitchen utensils.  If you have large hands you may be in for a struggle.While it may take some effort to wear these gloves, the improved safety is worth it in my opinion. I have had oven mitts actually burn using them indoors in a kitchen oven, so can only imagine what would have happened outdoors on an open flame with a grill.

5.0,"This is the third cordless hedge trimmer I've owned. The first two (made by Ryobi)were affordable and easy to use, but neither seemed up to the tasks I bought them to do. They frequently ended up being overwhelmed by what I considered a moderate workload and their battery life was, in a word, short (think 10-15 minutes of trimming at a stretch). So after giving up on those models I decided to get the new Black & Decker LHT2436 Cordless Hedge Trimmer and see what a 36-volt battery could do.Quick answer: a 36-volt battery is a game changer. Longer answer: a 36-volt battery provides both the power and the capacity to do at least an hour of varied trimming without a recharge - which is pretty awesome performance at this price point.Aside from my power and capacity requirements, I also wanted a trimmer that could handle more than some light hedge work. The Black & Decker LHT2436 Trimmer is supposed to cut through a 3/4"" branch, and I am happy to confirm that that specification is accurate. I was able to cut through both branches and vines that size without too much strain. After a few weeks of regular use, the trimmer seems to be holding up quite well.The other major factor in terms of product satisfaction is ergonomics, and this is where the Black & Decker LHT2436 Trimmer really excels. It's extremely well balanced and the reduction in vibration compared to other models I've used is remarkable. That alone reduces the fatigue factor significantly, and the relatively light weight completes the package. This trimmer is well designed and you can feel it every time you use it.This is definitely a five-star product, and well worth a serious look if you're in the market for a cordless trimmer.",1340755200,2012-06-27
4.0,"If you have plants in large pots that you occassionally move around, your back will thank you for buying this ""Garden Genius"" pot filler. I have long used rocks and/or broken pottery in the bottom of my plants, which adds considerable weight. I have a 5 foot tree in my kitchen, which must be moved every few weeks to vac around the floor. I've always had to grab the trunk of the tree rather than the rim of the pot because the pot itself is just too heavy to push to the side. I replanted that tree this afternoon, and what a difference! Though still heavy because of the dirt and the tree itself, I'm guessing the pot is at least 5 lbs lighter now. I like that the product is re-usable, and you can easily clean it at the end of the growing season or to move to a new pot. As someone else mentioned in a review, it is a bit pricey, but I do expect it to last for many years.",1308614400,2011-06-21

4.0,This is good to we have only used it twice so far and was able to charge our phone and small tablet it will also let you charge various portable devices. The size is OK like a large text book but definitely not as heavy. It worked as advertised. It's good to have for emergencies or if your going to be out doors for a few days.I gave it 4 stars because I prefer when my portable charging devices have several ways to be charged in-case the sun is not feeling cooperative. So it will not be replacing my Ambient Weather Emergency charger since it has solar/hand crank/battery/AC/DC/USB ect and also functions as radio/flashlight ect.So great to have compact user friendly and pretty efficient just not the best option for our emergency bug out bag.

5.0,"I got this because the 2 handle design intrigued me and the rotating pourer/sprinkler meant I wouldn't have to misplace a part.  I am very good at misplacing.  The fill hole is offset so it is easy to fill even with my sprinkler wand and the upper rotating handle makes it a joy to carry around as well as extra support for pouring.  One review says that it sprinkles heavy but with this size can that is not unusual and it is a better sprinkler than many, like a heavy rain with a large pattern.  If you need a lighter sprinkling can get the OXO which I also have and is  very good.[...]One thing though, if the can is partially filled and you grab the upper handle and start walking the can will tip forward and spill water from the spout.  You have to get used to using the fixed handle when the can is partially full but it is lighter and not a problem.  It is very well built and the pourer/sprinkler fits tight.  I have many containers so I use a can a lot so for me 25 bucks was a good buy.

2.0,"I wouldn't recommend this trimmer to a friend. It's a LOT of trimmer for a very LITTLE benefit. The lack of line feeding alone is enough to drive you mad.PROS1. INEXPENSIVE.2. POWERFUL. I have a small yard that I typically mow with an old-fashioned, manual push mower. Oftentimes I will go over the yard with a trimmer before I use the push mower  to handle thick and weedy patches. This trimmer does a great job in that respect.CONS1. LINE WON'T FEED. I have to take the line housing apart at least 3 times every single time I trim. And my yard is not large! This is infinitely frustrating and renders this trimmer almost unusable for anything but the smallest of projects.2. EDGING IS HORRIBLE. First off, trying to edge just chews the line to pieces...resulting in repeated problems with CON #1. In addition, I can never seem to get a nice, straight edge despite following the instructions in the manual. Just can't do it.3. HEAVY. This thing weighs a LOT for an electric trimmer. Wow. The weight makes it somewhat difficult to control. (I've also used a trimmer that was too light, and equally difficult to control. So there's obviously a sweet spot. And it's not being met here.)",1399766400,2014-05-11
4.0,"Over the last five years, we've used three different brands of electronic rat traps.  They've all worked...you bait them, set them out without turning them on (to let the rats get used to their presence) and then turn them on.  From then on, you check them every morning and see what you've caught.  It's kind of like fishing, except the fish have four legs, a tail and aren't exactly edible.The battery life has been good.  The D-cells store a lot more charge compared to the C-cells used in some competing versions.  I haven't caught thirty rats yet, so I don't know if it meets the spec and I'm not about to act (as has been suggested) like a surrogate rat and stick my hand in there.Rat disposal is trivial...you pick the entire thing up, hold it over a trash can and the dead rat will slide out.All in all, I strongly recommend the Rat Zapper.

5.0,"I've owned my Craftsman lawn mower for about 7 years and so far have not ever done any maintenance on it.

It only takes a minute to set up (pop the lid off and remove the protective seal) and then you are up and running.  Or walking.  Just walk at a normal pace and the battery powered spreader does the rest.  With a small lawn you can have it fertilized in a few minutes.  To refill just pop the top back off and pour in a refill bag.  I've used a variety of fertilizer brands on my lawn and they all seem to do the job.  So far this one seems just fine as well.  The selling point isn't the fertilizer, it's the easy application for small lawns.  For that reason alone it's worth the price.  For larger lawns stick with a regular push spreader.",1403740800,2014-06-26
5.0,"This is a very efficient high-tech grill.  The heat is concentrated in a diffused 11.25-inch radius circle.  This provides reasonably consistent heat throughout the 365 square inch circle while preventing much of it from escaping, unless used in high winds in which case the heat won't be consistently even and the grill won't necessarily be efficient.  The heat diffuser is unique to Napoleon - it gives efficient distribution of heat.  For its size, the grill is heavy at 62 pounds.The temperature gauge is helpful in several ways including to control the grill temperature at lower heat settings which can make it more efficient and get optimal results with dense foods.  There are low side vents immediately underneath the bowl to control flare-ups.  The instructions indicate that the recommended number of charcoal to use is 50.  There is a charcoal starter that helps a lot prior to cooking.The lid is not just a very large handle that doesn't get hot, but it's located at a 45-degree angle to the hinge, meaning we don't have to open it over the heat.  That impressed me, my neighbors and the UPS guy that sometimes takes his break at my house.  It's actually the first thing people notice about the grill.  Please take a look at the product photo (on the Amazon page) to see how the handle is lined up with the hinge - pretty good.  One can also spin the handle to the other side, so the photo could have shown the handle on the other side too.The bottom assembly is high-gauge and wheels aren't robust, but it probably isn't blowing over because it's so heavy and stands with a fairly low center of gravity.  The company has another assembly called a kettle cart that stands higher and with a real nice side handle and even a folding side shelf that looks practical to me.  The ash catcher (on all PRO22K models) comes out in a simple way, has a handle and can be dumped with ease.The grill itself is interesting.  The grill is cast iron - super heavy, not like a cheap grill at all.  The grill is wavy-design but also with two hinges that can be put to good use for what the company calls ""indirect cooking.""  But the cast iron grill with hinges also makes it possible to add charcoal or move the charcoal around.  Now something interesting is that the grill can be set at 3 different height levels by just picking it up, rotating it in the air and placing it down again - it's a lot higher quality level system than it probably seems by my description.  One needs hot pads to change grill height during cooking.The company is Napoleon Gourmet Grills, a privately-owned Canadian company with 700 employees according to the polite ""Customer Care"" employee - whose last name was actually Napoleon - that called me upon my request made on the contact page of their site.The instructions warn that the finish of the grill will be damaged if water is used to extinguish the coals.  However, the finish is porcelain and is not supposed to peel.  The grill has a limited lifetime warranty and one doesn't have to register one's warranty.  Napoleon also makes parts available since this is an investment compared to the inexpensive grills.Whereas I've described some of the physical features of the grill, I have some experience using it and it does distribute heat evenly on par with a convection oven.  My interaction with the company made me feel confident about the product, to say the least.  As I've stated, the UPS guy and neighbors validated my sense that this is a good grill, to the extent that people can do this while sampling some of the results.",1380931200,2013-10-05

4.0,I needed a better pair of pruners. I had a pair that the handles had to open further than my hands could open just to get the blades to open up enough for pruning. These are way better and easier to manage. They are also light weight and have a more comfortable grip. I have to agree with another reviewer in that they don't work the same for left handed people. I thin it has something to do with the bottom handle that twists slightly when you squeeze the handles together.These are super sharp and one thing I like about them is that when your cutting a branch they don't jam up and you get the branch wedged sideways in-between the blades. Fiskars make great scissors and now i can say great pruners too.,1353024000,2012-11-16
3.0,"This is my third electronic mouse trap. I've also used the single-mouse version (excellent) and another brand's rat version (killed well, but still had to be emptied each time, and an even worse battery drain).Here's how this one works: the mouse goes up the little mouse stairs and into a chamber where he smells peanut butter. When he gets to a certain contact point, he's electrocuted, then dropped into the little drawer underneath.This attracted and killed mice fairly well, and I like the convenience of not having to check on it every day, but the batteries ran out so quickly that it kind of became more of a hassle than the single trap (batteries last a long time, but you have to empty after each kill or you get a horrible rotten mouse mess). The single was so efficient I could even use good rechargeable batteries. If you try rechargeables with the big models, you'll be switching them after every kill.At some point the little floor that zaps them and then drops out and dumps them in the drawer got a little loosey-goosey and I can't tell if it's still making contact. I haven't seen any mice this early this winter (it's super mild, so the weather's not driving them in), so I can't be sure. I'm not brave enough to test it myself. :)",1327536000,2012-01-26
5.0,"Honestly, I was a bit skeptical, at first.  I have a ""closet"" on the patio of my condo which houses the AC unit and various other things.  I put the trap inside, and after just a few hours. . .  ~Z~A~P~ a mouse was dead.A couple of things. . . . First, it's true that there is very little information / instructions on the package.  That's why I've added the information below, which I think you will find VERY helpful.  Second, it states that this trap can hold up to three mice.  Well, I don't really see how that's possible.  Once one mouse is dead inside, I don't know how other mice are supposed to get in. . . or why they would want to, being that there is a dead mouse there already.  For this reason, I don't know that this trap is any better than the model M2524 which is a couple of $$'s less expensive.  Nonetheless, I've actually ordered a second one of these, because I like it so much.Victor M2524 Electronic Mouse TrapThe below information is from ""CF"" from the black version, model M2524.  I found the information to be VERY helpful.1. First and foremost, people overbait these traps BIGTIME. (See the 2nd photo provided by a customer.) If some of that huge mass of peanut butter falls onto the metal floor-plate, the trap zaps the peanut butter and de-activates! Mice can now come in and dine on the peanut butter. She said to just put a TINY dab of peanut butter on the far wall (opposite the entrance). Use a toothpick. Or spread a very thin smear of it with a knife. Mice have a very acute sense of smell, and that's what draws them in. They don't need any more bait than that.2. The mouse has to contact BOTH metal plates in order to get zapped. And both plates have to be clean of debris. That means after you catch a mouse, take a Q-tip or whatever, and remove any hair, any little spot of urine, whatever, from the metal plates. This is not a squeamish job at all and they don't come anymore squeamish than I am! (I do shuddering freak-outs at the sight of a mouse, dead OR alive.) There was a teensy smear of liquid (I assume urine) and two hairs that had shed off the mouse.3. Be aware that ""On"" means that the LINE icon side of the switch is pressed down. The CIRCLE icon pressed down means ""off."" People get those confused. Turn it OFF when cleaning or baiting. Turn it ON once the trap is baited, and the top door has been snapped shut.4. The batteries go in with the flat side of the battery against the springs. And I have had battery connections with other things ""not work."" I had this problem continuously with a radio. Finally, it dawned on me, give a little pull on the springs. One was coiled into itself just slightly. That fixed it. You need the springs to push against the batteries enough to hold the two tight against each end. And they need to be lined up straight, not crooked.5. When you bait the trap, close the door FIRMLY, and turn the unit on. You will see a green light BUT!!! it only stays on for 2 seconds! That green light is SUPPOSED to go off. It only goes on for the 2 seconds so that you can confirm that the unit is on, and it's working. Otherwise, if it stayed on all the time, it would eat battery life. So when it goes off, don't think, like I did, that there's an electronic failure.6. For safety reasons, the unit is designed so that when the door (over the maze and metal plates) is open, the unit will de-activate. I have no idea how the other reviewer shocked himself, but for sure, turn the unit OFF before tinkering around with baiting, cleaning plates, or messing with the batteries. In any event, when you set the trap, bait it, then double check to make sure the door is snapped closed. Then, and only then, turn the unit on. You will see the green light for about 2 seconds, which shows you it's working and ready to go. Then the light goes out. If you open the door again (and she didn't say this but I have a feeling it's the case), turn the unit off and then on again after the door has been shut.7. Once a mouse has been zapped and is inside, the light will flash on and off to let you know. NOTE! The light only flashes about every 7 seconds. A quick glance at it is not enough, there could be a dead mouse inside and you could miss the cycle of light flashing. So look at it for 7 seconds.",1363737600,2013-03-20

5.0,"I bought this and its big (75') brother.  I was reluctant because they're kind of pricey compared to your average garden hose, but I was hoping this would free me from tangles, kinks and the major hassle of re-coiling a long hose when done with it.  It does all that.  It's like a big Slinky, except that if it does get tangled (which you almost have to work at to accomplish), a little shaking removes the tangle.  Storage is beyond easy - you drag the hose where you want to store it, and just drop it on top of itself.  Makes a funny-looking pile of coils but that is really all there is to it.The fittings on each end are of very good quality and there are robust-feeling strain relievers at each end.  I was afraid that when I really stretched it out, it would lose its tendency to coil back up but not so.  I was mostly worried that the smaller-than-usual diameter of the hose wouldn't allow enough water to pass for me to use my small electric pressure washer to full effect, but I could tell no difference with these new hoses vs. traditionally sized larger ones.Yes, they're expensive, but in this case I think I got what I paid for.

5.0,"I've used this saw for several hours which is sufficient to give me an opinion as to its effectiveness and value. It's easy to set up, just use the wingnut clamp to secure it to the pole and off you go, no tools required. It stays put as does the extention of the pole. One easy to use clip on the pole allows you to move the extention in or out and lock it. It stays locked. Use it off the pole to trim off limbs from felled trees or easy to reach stuff. I've found many uses for the saw without the pole that makes to yard work go easy. It's safer than a gas chain saw and lighter. It is durable, it hasn't failed me. I maintain my machines and keep them ready to work, but I don't baby this saw or any piece of machinery. This saw does what it's supposed to without complaint. I pinched the chain in a limb (operator error!) and had to free it with another saw, but the Remington went right back to working without throwing a chain, bending, or breaking. Anyway you ...slice... it, using a chain saw to cut trees is tough on machinery. This saw has chewed through pine, oak, and cherry quickly and easily. When it's at full extention it's a little unwieldy because, afterall, you have a weight on one end of a pole and it will tend to be top heavy. But it is light enough to manuver and keep where you want it to cut and I haven't found its balance to be a problem. It does leak chain oil. In the yard, who cares? In the garage, it can be messy. But also tells you in the manual that it will leak the chain oil and recommends that you empty the oil resevoir when you store the saw. It holds about 3 ounces of motor oil and draining the oil is a ten second operation. Not a problem. When in use, one push of the oiler cap before eash cut and it's happy. It has an aggressive chain tooth layout which helps to slice through even big limbs. It's a ten inch saw, if you need to cut 14+ inch limbs/trees, you'll need a heavier chainsaw that's designed for that purpose. If you use this saw for its designed use, you won't have any difficulty pruning or taking off fairly meaty limbs from a safe position. I recommend it.",1334102400,2012-04-11
5.0,"This machine is a back saver.  I've used it for everything it's intended for.  For the blower function the leaves, grass clippings, dirt and rocks go flying away without any issue and I don't even have it at its highest setting!  The vacuum takes on dry/damp leaves and twigs without issue.  It's so powerful that if I place it close to the ground it sticks.  Not once did it get jammed while vacuuming leaves.  The mulcher function does its job without issue as well.I can't see why there's so many negative reviews on this model.  If your machine broke after a one use then return it to Amazon for another one.  If your complaints are in regards to the vacuum getting jammed then that would be on the user.  Sticking this into a huge pile of leaves will obviously create a jam.  There's just too much debris going into the impeller too fast which will cause it to suffocate.  Simply hover it over the pile of leaves to take in a little at a time and your problems would be none to minimal.  As a blower this thing launches debris.  It's very powerful that it will launch small rocks.  The mulcher is great for reducing bagging.  The included bag for mulching/vacuuming comes with a strap to help hold the unit while working.  I've used this thing multiple times and saved on bags, time and energy.  My back never felt better after cleaning.  For $75, I can't see the issue here.

We use a 2 cup measuring cup, filtered tap water & 3 minutes in our microwave gets the water to a fast boil.  Pour in the 1/4 cup of sugar, stir & let it cool.  This is the exact amount needed to fill the 8oz feeder.  We decided not to color the nectar, as most say it's not necessary.&#9642; Our cleaning routine:The cleaning is very easy & should be done at each refilling.  While the freshly made nectar is cooling, we prewarm, then fill the glass bottle with boiling hot water & let it sit.  No need to scrubing the inside of the bottle.  Next we pull off the bee guards & set them in the sink to be cleaned by pouring boiling hot water on & thru them.  The last item to clean is the base & perch.  You guessed it, more boiling hot water is used to flush everything clean.  No need to pull anything apart, the boiling hot water will get to all the nooks & crannies.  Cleaning = piece-of-cake! :)&#9658; Notes:&#9642; It's easy to tell when the feeder is completely empty, as the Hummingbirds will move from one flower to the next testing each flower for nectar.&#9642; It disturbs the Hummingbirds to remove the feeder for refilling, so we do this now after dark.  When we did this during the day, one Hummingbird would come within a couple feet to investigate!&#9658; Update - April 8, 2013The Hummingbirds have started visiting our feeder, so I've upgraded our product rating to 5! :)&#9658; Update - April 28, 2013We have regular vistors now & it's a real treat to have the Hummingbirds frequent our feeder.  The formula we're using seems to be perfect, as the Hummingbirds love it!Not want wanting to be without a feeder, we decided to buy a spare one... just in case ours needs to be replaced.&#9658; Update - May 15, 2013When the ""spare"" feeder was delivered, we were surprised to see the bee guards had been redesigned.  Instead of the square shape, the bee guard is now rounded... a more realistic flower shape.  Today we installed those bee guards & right away we noticed the Hummingbirds spending less time probing & more time perched & feeding.  Yes, the improved shape is a winner in our book!&#9658; Update - November 24, 2013We never realized Hummingbirds stayed around our area this late in the year.  We don't get as many vistors, but they do come by, so we make sure the feeder is kept filled.&#9658; Update - November 29, 2013 - A problem & a solution!&#9642; It's getting cold now & there's a problem with the nectar freezing!  I had to use a hair dryer to melt the ice that had formed.  This worked, but I decided a better solution was needed.  I wired up a single red 7 watt, C7 incandescent indicator bulb (like a Christmas or nightlight bulb) & attached it to the glass (touching) with Velcro ties.  This keeps the nectar in the upper forties when the air temperature is below freezing.  I have a red bulb installed & the red light doesn't look bad at all, especially at night!  I'd post some picture, but this listing doesn't allow pictures to be posted. :(&#9642; We noticed that the Hummingbirds perch on the side that has the bulb, so we think they enjoy the heat given off by the bulb as they feed.&#9642; The temperature has dipped to 10F & there's no ice forming on lower part of the feeder.  The heat from the small 7 watt bulb can't keep the entire feeder ice free when the temperatures are too low.  We notice the Hummingbirds like to sit near the light to keep warm while sipping nectar.",1365033600,2013-04-04
3.0,"** updated with second mow at bottom**I really do enjoy mowing my yard... it's a little more than  1/3 acre and a push mower is good exercise.  My other mower is a 13 year old Toro Recycler 22"" deck with personal pace self-propelled drive.  I've kept that gas engine purring and it's still running strong - Briggs and Stratton make a good engine.  But... it is loud (I mow with ear buds or plugs in) and it's considered not as ""green"" as some current options.  So even though I'm a happy Toro gas mower owner... I thought I'd give an electric a chance.A quick pros and cons for the start here...  remember that I've only assembled and mowed once with it....+ Very light - this is a mower my 6 year old could handle (and no... I don't let her mow).+ packaged mostly assembled - only two Philips head screws to anchor the handle.  The rest is tool-less.+ Significantly quieter than my gas engine mower.  I don't have a SPL gauge, but I can mow without protection and wouldn't get a headache-  17"" deck is a bit narrow.  It sure fits in the garage easy, but I'm adding an additional swipe after every 3 passes to keep up with my 22"" gas mower.  Will be a bit more exercise... and a lawn pattern with more wheel marks.-  Not self-propelled... perhaps this is an observation more than a Con...  It's light, so it doesn't feel like it needs a drive system-  Mostly plastic construction - long term durability?-  Wheels seem less rugged than ones designed for steel deck mowers.Now that we are past the bullets...  Assembly...well the handle attaches with two screws and the upper handle with two tool-less bolts with a hand side wingnuts... they all work well and provide a study feel when complete.The fancy plastic grass catcher comes in 4 pieces...  that's right... 4!  I spent more time inserting tab A into slot B than should be necessary.  The grass catcher is a work of functional art.  Two tone, with a compactor arm built into the unit.  It's a great concept in lawn tech.  I have some concerns over the long term strength over the 4 piece unit versus a molded one piece.  Time will tell if those tabs maintain their strength.  Some additional concerns are the weight.  The plastic catching unit is obviously heftier than a fabric catcher and when full and compacted with grass -- It's likely going to be a lot heavier than the motor deck.  The first spring mow was more of a top off cut than a normal full cut, so I didn't get to witness if the lack of weight in the mower deck and the ability to compact a lot of grass in this catcher turn into a big negative in keeping an even cut through less than ideal slightly bumpy terrain.From a grass catching perspective, it appeared to have less of a ""suction"" than my Toro gas unit.  It would go over leaves without pulling them up into the catcher,  perhaps this will improve when the height of the grass increases, but it's a noticeable different to the gas mower.  Mowing without the catcher in place is possible, but doesn't produce a mulching action when doing a light cut - I will check this again when the grass is higher for the next cut.The front edge of the mower has a molded handle built into the unit.  I'm really not sure of why it's there - the top handle makes more sense.  But with garage space a premium, it looks a great place to use a hook and pulley to pull this mower up and hang it on the wall like my other electric yard tools...  unlike a gas engine; I don't have to worry about it spilling out oil or gas...The height of the mower is changed using a single handle adjustment behind the rear left wheel (its orange in the picture).  When the mower is raised and lowered, the cut gauge on the side reads out in inches...  I think it's great that it is simplified to not have to move each wheel to change height.  Much more user friendly.  My only concern with this method of raising the cut is that it is only raising the back end of the mower to achieve this height, putting the cutting blade at an angle.  This isn't as much of an issue on the grass in the middle of the cut, but the edge cuts won't be at the same even height due to the blade angle.  I don't yet have full enough grass to check the impact of raising it all the way up to 3""...  but I'm interested in hearing others experiences with cut quality due to this function.The blade had a factory edge on it, which is normal for all mowers...  I'll be giving it a 90 degree sharp edge before the next mow...Handling... I'm used to a heavy mower, doing a little bit of ""Tokyo Drifting"" with a self-propelled unit to slide into the end cuts and radius cuts.  The much lighter deck of this unit is definitely a different feel and seems easy to lift the mower off of its cut angle/depth.  I had to consciously change the way I'm putting pressure on the handle to keep the deck down in walking turns.The balance of the mower feels a little off...  with very little weight in the electric engine and deck and the handle being attached over the rear wheels,  the additional weight of the catcher (especially when full) makes it unbalanced causing the front wheels to easily rise on a bumpy area...  This leads to an uneven cut.  Moving the handle attachment an inch or two forward of the rear wheels should make this tool feel more stable and cut more uniformly.And the biggest difference between gas and electric... the cord.  I've used electric dethatchers and other devices in which you have to be cord conscious, so it didn't cause me too much issue.  But it is a significant consideration in how you mow versus a gas (cordless) mower.  Your mowing pattern has to be cord friendly... and your cord needs to be long enough to support your mowing swipes.  Cord management adds time to the mowing cycle, and even though it was out of the way most of the time, cords get caught up in my shrubs and plants, requiring adept lasso maneuvers to prevent walking to move a cord.Summary?  It's okay.  It may be durn perfect for a very small yard - but that's not my yard.  Even with a light early spring cut, it took enough time additional to the gas mower that it was noticeable - But that's really to be expected when you are dealing with a thinner deck 17"" vs 22"" and power cord management.  The jury is still out on the cut quality - I will add to the review as the grass thickens up.  But the height adjustment angled method is concerning me.  The unit is quieter and gives me green ""street cred""  if you ignore the fact that Ohio power comes from burning coal...  I'll improve this review as I continue to use the unit this next month.  For now the Gas Toro mower is still hibernating.******Second mow this week at 3""...  The grass grew like the preferred weed that it is last week with all of the rain.  This time i added a 25' extension cord to my 50' cord to prevent unexpected loss of power from ripping it out of the socket.  That seemed to make my range much more acceptable in swipes across the yard.In the much thicker grass, the lack of a drive engine and the plasticy light nature of the unit made it more difficult to keep a nice clean line. I may just be used to the control of the Toro that makes this easier - I'll mark it off to my lack of skill , but my lines were not very pretty.  Although I could hear the engine audibly bogging a little with the grass cut, the cut seemed clean and the catcher was doing its job.  I could not visibly tell while standing if the cut was uneven due to the height mechanism angling the blade, but getting down to the level of the grass low on my knees, it was visible.  So this mower will not have a straight even cut at max height...  that being said, at that height, such unevenness is hard to detect -- which is the compromise the engineers took for the ease of height adjustment.  At the lower height settings, the blade lowers to level, making a low cut the most even it accomplishes..  when it is the most noticeable.After mowing with it for about an hour, doing the cable dance, and emptying the unit several times... I finally returned to my Toro recycler.  Checked its oil, added gas, primed... and on the first pull it started right up, as if 6 months of dormancy never happened..  I finished the yard faster with the gas mower.So why did I give up?  As I was concerned the B&D; deck is too light.  When the heavy plastic grass catcher was just 3/4 full, it was so heavy that it could not even sit on its own four wheels due to being off balance.  It would fall back and rest on the grass catcher.  This lack of weight down on the front end of the mower leads to an uneven cut due to the front end bouncing, and me always pushing down the front to keep it cutting the grass.It's now hanging on the wall on my garage as a backup if my main mower has issues - but my recommendation is that this unit would only be best for those with very small yards and a willingness to deal with an evolving design that hasn't yet been perfected... to avoid having the maintenance and fuel requirements of a gas mower.",1398556800,2014-04-27
5.0,"The first thing I noticed about these scissors are how sharp they are. It is almost scary sharp. So they really get the job done and due to the titanium will keep their sharpness for a long time. The engineers must have sat down and decided to create the ultimate shears. Let's see how many cool features we can include? I won't mention them all because they are already covered in the description. The hard plastic cover that they slide into is designed so well that you need to insert it just a certain way for it to go in, and once in there it is not going to fall out.The other thing that impressed me the most was how comfortable the handles are. It reminds me of a well designed carved base wooden chair; the surface is hard but it feels super comfortable due to the fit.Scissors are an item that you need more than one pair of. I have pruning scissors for plants that also hold onto the cut stem. I went out into the yard with these and they do a great job even on the woodier stems. I keep them next to my desk because they will outperform my other pairs of scissors just because of how sharp they are. Sometimes though you just want a regular pair of scissors sitting in a desk jockey to get the job done. These you have to pull out of the holder and they are a little more bulky than a standard pair, but that extra heft goes into extra heavy duty capabilities; need to cut up some cardboard, these will fly right through it.I can't think of any downside to these with their super sharp edges and handy ""other"" functions built in; they are a must have for any kitchen junk drawer. Highly recommended.",1308182400,2011-06-16
4.0,"The Sno Brum works beautifully in plain, regular snow.  It has a large foam &#34;pusher&#34; that pushes show from the windows and surface of the car without stratching the surface of the car.  It is fabulous.  It can handle anything from a light dusting to several inches of snow (anything deeper needs to be done in layers or shifts), and makes it fairly painless to clear the car.However...  it is not perfect.  It doesn't work well in two different situations.1) The Sno Brum will not work well in any snow that has even a small amount of ice and/or freezing rain mixed in.  It can't deal with ice at all.  To be fair, other snow brooms can't handle ice, either.2) The Sno Brum doesn't work well against any irregularities in elevation on the surface of the car.  For example, it doesn't do well against the windshield wipers, against moon and/or sun roofs, etc.Overall, I am quite pleased with the Sno Brum and would recommend it for most winter weather situations.",1386460800,2013-12-08
5.0,"These are attractive, solid yet lightweight planters...note=they are not pots but rather planters. As others have already mentioned they do not have holes in the bottom making them the perfect solution for those wishing to avoid water spills or stains on their flooring (especially from that blasted blue fertilizer...all you gardeneers out there know what I mean!).The pair look great together and are actually larger than I expected even though I read the dimensions. My only complaint is the seam - yes, it can be turned to the back but it requires attention to placement to avoid seeing a fairly significant sized seam that runs vertically through each. Outside of that (and the lack of a drainage hole if that bothers you) these are terrific!I have a decent sized back porch, a second fairly large patio plus a small greenhouse with plants on each - as you might imagine, I have my fair share of pots and always on the search for more.

2.0,"I'm a gardener and for the last several years I have been practicing the ""art"" of gardening with varying degrees of success.  I buy heirloom seed and raise my seedlings before planting which for me, is fun but still work.  I wanted to try out these seed cups by Miracle-Gro and so far I kind of like them. I won't be changing to these from what I've been doing, but for someone who has a very small area to grow vegetables/herbs or just want a small patio garden I think this is a great way to accomplish that.You won't be raising a large garden with numerous plants of each kind, but you will get a small sampling of some fairly popular vegetable garden plants.  I'm sure the seed used in these seed cups are NOT heirloom, so I wouldn't bother trying to save any to use the following year because they most likely will not produce any vegetables.  Plants yes, but no produce.  And I wouldn't mix them with plants that are heirloom if you're planning on saving any seeds because they will cross pollinate and could sabotage your heirlooms.However, for children, school classroom projects, or the micro gardener I think these are perfect.  They are very easy to plant, I just made a small hole in one of my raised beds and pushed the entire container into it after peeling off the lid. Sprinkle with some water and wait.  It's too early yet to report on the quality of the produce, but so far I have only planted the herbs. I already have a lot of the other type plants growing and don't want to risk cross pollination. I always get excited when I see the new plant babies breaking the surface of the soil - never gets old for me!I'm looking forward to some fresh herbs though, and each seed cup will produce several seedlings.  I don't like to waste seedlings so I carefully separate them and replant.  Most people will choose one or two of the healthiest seedlings and discard the remaining ones, but I like to give everybody a chance if I have the room.  I think these seed cups are an excellent way to introduce gardening to children and for those who just want to start out with something very easy and not much of it.  Some plant food granules are included along with very good instructions.4.19.14 UPDATEThe plant pots I planted never amounted to anything, and this year while getting my raised bed ready for new plantings I found a pot I planted from last year with it's seeds still in it, buried underneath the soil that didn't germinate.  The pot didn't even decay much.  I wouldn't waste my money on these things but buy fresh seeds instead or seedlings that have already been started. I have a few more pots left over and I'll try them again somewhere in the garden, but I'm not expecting them to do anything.",1374796800,2013-07-26

5.0,"This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill, so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.

I've never used a corded trimmer, but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building), and keep it charged.

It also would start to die if it didn't receive a lot of water, and we're talking much more water than the rest of the grass, including sod I had down.Every area where this grass was has been replaced with grass from other places in the yard from gardens I dug up this year.

Hooked through a 7 amp charge controller to a pair of 110 amp hour deep cells in parallel for a total of 220 amp hr's.I first hooked two panels up to see how they did, they worked well in very low light but couldn't ever get the batteries to ""full"" on the controller. I then hooked up a third panel and that gave enough to bring the batteries to full after a full day. With six panels hooked up, it will bring the batteries to ""full"" in a very few hours from a 30% drained condition.These units are less then optimally placed and rarely get full sun, but do very well even without that. Two panels in full sun may very well have been able to bring the batteries to ""full"" but location is a problem for me.

The blue bottle doesn't have any effect on whether the hummers will use the feeder, (most hummingbird feeders are red). I have a red one next to this blue one, and the birds don't seem to prefer one over the other. A common problem with cheaper hummingbird feeders is that they leak, either at the feeding ports or one of the other joints. This one doesn't.

So depending on how many of these mighty mites that visit you at once, you may want to use less than the full 16-oz capacity.

4.0,I have had the grill for about one month and have used it frequently. Pros: Fairly clear assembly instructions; Quality construction; Heats up to max temperature (around 550 degrees F) in approximately 10 minutes in warm weather; Temperature gauge useful to monitor RELATIVE not absolute temperature; Even temperature throughout two burner area. Cons: Stainless steel surface on folding wings is easily scratched; Door to cabinet must be exactly at 90 degrees to allow removal of drip pan; Hanging full propane tank on the weight gauge requires some flexibility and upper body strength.My assembly of the grill took about 3 hours. The instructions use pictures more than words and I had to redo the placement of the igniter line because it was not clear that it must run outside of the bracket for the drip pan.

The brass valve is awesome and lets you generated a stream up to about 20-30 feet in addition the length the hose stretches.Update 7/4/2014 - going to need to take off some stars.  The hose basically exploded this morning.  So after about only 4 months of use a few times a week, it seems to have suffered a catastrophic failure.  So not great product life.

I checked it a few days later and the rubber ring was gone and no mouse in sight. I set the trap again, a few days later the same, rubber ring is gone but no mouse. These little rubber rings are expensive and you have to man handle the trap to get them on it anyway. I assume the mice are dead but I really don't know because I never found a body.

For a month nothing happened. I thought maybe we don't have any more mice, having caught half a dozen earlier this winter. Also, I had bought a bunch of mouse-resistant containers for everything from rice to grass seed so there wasn't much in the house to attract mice except for shelter from cold and wet weather. Well, after a snow storm I spotted a small mouse and then found a second one, caught live in a ""humane"" plastic box trap. My husband released that one well away from the house and we set out a fresh trap and redid the bait in this Tri-kill trap. Within 24 hours this trap caught and killed two mice! So I guess they came in for shelter from the snow and went for the bait.",1362960000,2013-03-11

I can't just set out some traps, we have to have a focused consistent approach.I loved the Tom Cat mouse killer stations. The bait is attractive to mice. I can see from the top how active mice have been at each station. Every station I have set has had significant action. The poison works quickly. I have actually had two mice die at the station. One thing to be aware of is the active ingredient kills mice but the mice don't have that dead mouse smell. I think this is a huge plus.

4.0,"There are a couple of stand out things to like about this fire pit. For one, my other half had it assembled in less time than it took me to place fire resistant pavers on the deck. For another, compared to our (old, broken, ceramic) chimenea, this pit holds more wood and burns much hotter.We kicked off our summer with a bbq with visiting relatives and some neighbors. The firepit was prepared in advance and before evening fully turned to night we lit it and pulled chairs close. Once the fire was going (we may have overdone it as there was some serious popping going on) I was thankful for the efficiency of the cover.Given that it is metal, and the size of the flames, it was no surprise that it got hot. Really, really hot. Children, dogs and a couple of unsteady adults were kept under constant supervision anytime they were in the vicinity.I have only a couple of small criticisms. Neither would keep me from purchasing this fire pit. The first is it feels a little lightweight, given the picture and price. Second, the cover is a throwaway. I will either have to purchase a substitute cover or resolve to lug the fire pit to the garage.We have enjoyed our CobraCo Steel Mission Fire Pit at least once every weekend since its assembly and look forward to many more summer nights around the fire.",1403049600,2014-06-18

Having lived in an apartment complex where I wasn't permitted to have a grill for the last fifteen years, I was and still am quite excited about the grill.I spent a little more than I originally planned to pay, but decided that it was worth putting a little more money into it on the front end to prevent the desire to replace it within just a couple of years.A long-term investment like this needs to be protected, of course. I checked the Char-Broil site to see what cover they recommend for theChar Broil T480 4-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill, with Sideburnerand found that they recommend the Char-Broil 2185564 65-Inch Artisan Mountain Green Grill Cover, so I ordered it from Amazon.The cover is very thick, and I believe it will withstand rain and other weather should I eventually decide to keep the grill outside. For now I store it in the garage, but I still like to have the cover on it.This cover is easy to take on and off and looks as attractive as a grill cover can. The length is just a bit shorter than the grill itself, so you can wheel the grill around with the cover on without tripping over the edges.I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend it.",1335571200,2012-04-28

The top of the base snaps on-to the bottom of the base,which means to pull them apart, it easier to use the 'pull tabs' to pull with.The flowers (the feeding ports) are of soft plastic, which allows for easier washing/drying,and there's a perch in-front of each flower.The one part of the feeder I'm not as crazy about is the rest of the base,which is in 3 sections, and needs pulled apart for thorough cleaning.The center needs pulled out first, and is a bit stiff to pull, but the partition disc simply lifts out.All parts are plastic except the clear harden glass bottle.This 24 oz feeder is 8 1'2"". tall.",1370390400,2013-06-05

4.0,"I have a relatively small fenced back yard and a dog who loves to dig, so the back yard has a variety of obstacles (holes, trenches) that make it really tough to maneuver a heavy, regular sized gas lawn mower.  For the past couple of years I've been cutting it with a string trimmer (Black and Decker 18V cordless, an awesome machine) but the trimmer is really not suitable - it takes too long.  This item is as near to perfect for my application as you can get.  It's small and light so it's easy to move around and the battery lasts much longer than I need it to.  I don't mulch or bag and wish it had a little more oomph to spit the clippings out from the back but it's certainly adequate.  I dinged it one star for assembly instructions that required a lot of stopping and staring at the little diagrams to figure out some things, but managed to get it together in about 45 minutes with a relatively modest number of swear words.  Glad I bought this.UPDATE 4/9:It doesn't have enough power to push clippings out of the rear discharge in the best of circumstances...they more or less drool out.  If your grass is tall or moist, they don't come out at all, making this a mulcher whether you have the mulch plug installed or not.

The coils stay tight and neat if you are careful to never overstretch the hose.  Order a hose with much more length than you need to account for the coils - 50' of this type of hose does not equal 50' of reach (more like 25-30' of reach).  75' reaches about 40' or so.

Great idea, as the ants can really be a problem here certain times of the year.It holds 16 ounces of nectar, which is plenty for around here.  We don't get hordes of hummers so if the nectar sits in there too long without being emptied, it gets fouled.The only drawback I can see is that the base on the bottom says &#34;tighten&#34; with arrows showing the direction, but it seems to just press-fit, with no threads to actually secure it?

4.0,"For several years I've been trying to justify getting a smoker. I knew if I wanted one that it would have to be a good one, but spending the money for a smoker that I wasn't sure how much I'd use seemed almost frivolous.Finally we broke down and bought the WSM cooker. Living in New Orleans we can use it almost year round. The cooker is very simple to put together and is well constructed. The door seems a little flimsy but it works fine. The water smoker keeps the food moist. It's easy to adjust the heat up or down with adjusting the opening size of the vents around the bottom and on top of the smoker.Our first experiment was brisket. 14 hours of smoking a huge brisket, with only me having to go out a few times and adding some charcoal and wood chips, and we had tender, melting brisket, it was so good.Ducks, chicken, turkey breast, all have come out wonderful. I love seasoning and smoking turkey breasts and ham, then slicing them for lunch meat. I control the chemicals and we get wonderful smoked meat.I was concerned about this being a one hit wonder, we'd use it once or twice then put it away and forget it, I'm surprised at how versatile it is with being able to smoke different meats. I am going to try my own bacon soon, but it makes great smoked sausage.With some smokers you get an option to attach a cold smoke adapter, I do wish the weber had that option, but this is a great smoker that gets used at least once a week by us. I get up in the morning, start the coal in the chimney, put it in the smoker with some wood, put the meat on, and except for the occasional checking of the temp and maybe adding a little more charcoal or wood, I'm set.

5.0,"I was interested in this product to help deal with an abundance of chipmunks on my property  as well as stopping raccoons and squirrels from getting into my garbage cans. It has worked in both cases.Chipmunks: For some reason chipmunks have been in great abundance in my neighborhood. I live in New Jersey so my guess is the mild winter had something to do about it.  A few chipmunks are nice, more than a few eat flowers and vegetables and make a mess.I saw two holes in the ground that the chipmunks  were using as burrows.  I poured the Critter Ridder in and around the burrow holes and it seemed like activity around the burrow holes stopped. I still see some chipmunks but not as many as before.Raccoons and Squirrels:  I have half-a-dozen plastic garbage cans whose covers have holes in them due to hungry squirrels wanting to get at the food in them.  I also have awakened on many days to find my garbage cans knocked over but what I am pretty certain were raccoons foraging for food.Certain foods tend to be more appetizing than others. For some reason chicken and fish and certain fruits like apples and pears tend to attract the squirrels and raccoons more than others but any food is a target to them.I have been pouring Critter Ridder around my garbage cans and it seems to be keeping all animals away.  I threw chicken bones out one night and was expecting some animal to try to knock over my garbage can or get into it and nothing happened. I have been using this for three weeks and it has worked.I like the idea that this product is natural and will not poison or kill anything.  The smell alone is enough to make me take notice and I got some on my hand  which burned a little but I felt fine after washing my hands. The bottle has a handle and an easy pour cover which works great and except for the one occasion I have not gotten any more on me.Every week or so I pour out some more Critter Ridder around the burrows and garbage cans.

2.0,"I've tried a lot of pesticides, and to be honest, most of them aren't very successful. The best luck I've had is with Ortho RosePride Insect, Disease & Mite Control Aerosol, but the scent is so strong you need to wear a mask/eye goggles to spray it (in my opinion) and you cannot safely use it indoors. (As a general aside, the effectiveness of pesticide seems to be directly proportional to how severe the headache you get from the pesticide/scent when you use it.) This left me in a quandary, since my mealy bug/spider mite problem on my indoor citrus and coffee trees was horrible all winter. I did use the Safer product until I ran out of it, and it was initially moderately successful on the spider mites.  It did not, however, work at all on the mealy bugs, and the spider mites seemed to build up resistance to it.

5.0,"Ladies, before I got this Toro e-Cycler, I had never, ever, ever cut the grass before . . . never, ever, ever . . . not even once.  (Maybe just like you. )  This probably goes back to high school, when one of the girls in my neighborhood told me her father had cut off two of his fingers, while cutting the grass.  Not being a brave child, I internalized what she said, and  forever saw a lawn mower as being totally dangerous!  (Not to mention, you can always find a guy to cut the grass for you.)I decided, however, it was high time to overcome this childhood fear.  I heard that electric lawn mowers were easier for females to use, due to the cord thing you have to pull to start gas lawn mowers.  Yes, that is a sexist observation, but I'm afraid I do have weak arm muscles.  (Maybe just like you.)  Thus, electric was the way to go.  The e-Cycler is also only a 20-inch lawn mower.  And it is quite pretty!  It's bright red with a deep black grass bag.  I would have preferred hot pink, but I don't think Toro makes hot pink lawn mowers.Okay, ladies... when Amazon ships these lawn mowers, they use UPS, and the UPS guy will be quite happy to put your big lawn mower box in the garage for you.  It  comes almost totally assembled.  All you have to do is unfold the handles and tighten the handle knobs by hand.  If you want to do this yourself, do it right away before any guys see the box.  Yes, to many guys, a big Toro box is like a big Christmas present with a big bow on it.  They will be fighting over who gets to open the box and assemble the lawn mower.Next, it is VERY important to read the directions, especially all the safety warnings.  And it was worse than I feared!  Not only can you lose fingers or toes while cutting the grass, objects can shoot out from under the lawn mower, and injure or kill you, children, pets or innocent bystanders.  I'm not joking!  Even a worn grass bag  can ""result in serious personal injury or death to the operator or bystanders"".  You're suppose to wear shoes, long pants, safety glasses and no jewelry, while cutting the grass.  Today, when I cut the grass for the first time, it was very hot, so I'm afraid I wore shorts instead of long pants.  I also had no safety glasses, so that was out, too.  (Of course, though, if my friend in high school had told me her father was blinded while cutting the grass, I would have run right down to the hardware store and bought safety glasses!)Starting the lawn mower was very easy.  You just put the key in the key slot, and pull out a plastic lever on the handle, which turns on the lawn mower.  When you let go of the lever, the lawn mower turns off in three seconds.  What could be easier?  I first checked the lawn for rocks, sticks and baby bunnies, and then just pulled out the lever.  After pushing it for approximately 60 seconds, one of my  neighbors suddenly appeared , with her dog on a leash,  just a couple of feet away from me, and announced:  ""It is quiet!""  Totally shocked someone was standing so close to me and my operating lawn mower, I just stared at her at first, but then asked:  ""Do you mean the lawn mower?""  She replied:  ""Yes, it's very quiet.""  Okay!  Ladies . . . if you are looking for a quiet lawn mower, this is the one to get, according to my lovely neighbor, who along with her dog, wasn't injured or killed by me and my operating lawn mower.Mowing right along, I discovered cutting grass is a lot like vacuuming, only it takes more arm strength.  It's actually sort of like a cardio workout, too.  Instead of feeling tired after cutting the grass, I actually felt energized.  Yes, ladies . . . it's good exercise!  And it will build up your arm muscles!  In the fall, you can also use it to mulch all the pretty leaves in your yard, too, when they are no longer pretty.  Then, after the yard cutting season is over, the directions say you can store your Toto for three months, without recharging it.  I guess that means in the dead of winter, if you have a winter where you live, you are going to have to recharge it every three months.  You also much recharge the battery after cutting the grass every time.  But, hey, there's no gas to buy or spill, and no gas cord thing that needs yanking!  Also, remember to sweep off the surface of the lawn mower after each use, and check the blade area for anything caught up in the blade.  And don't listen to any guy who tells you to wash it down with a hose!  It's electric . . . and the coolest, easiest lawn mower a girl could get!",1273622400,2010-05-12
5.0,I have been sold on Black & Decker for years I have a corded string trimmer that still works as good as new that is well over 20 years old the same can be said for half inch chuck corded drill well over 20 years for it and it is used often. I had a B&D sweep stick internal battery type that lasted 22 years and last month I bought the cordless pole saw and like it so much I decided to get the trimmer and once again have used it twice and very satisfied with its ability to get the job done. Since it is a single line trimmer and the smaller diameter line it would not be good in heavy thick weeds but ideal for grass trimming and very easy to handle it is a very well balanced tool and you cannot beat the price at Amazon and even better you get the extra battery. I can tell you a local big box store in our town which is well known around the world for cheap prices is asking $16 more for this same item and $40 for the batteries. If you want to look at it from my view point you are buying the batteries and getting the trimmer free.,1302480000,2011-04-11
3.0,"I've usually found Fiskars gardening products to be innovative and effective, but there's usually a kink in the design.  I still swear by the Power Lever shears because the blades move parallel and effortlessly, but the kink is the retaining pin which is a pressure fit which simply loosens with use as the hole in the blades enlarge.  As to this very lovely and innovative Power Gear lopper, well, let's say there are a lot of kinks.  As you may have discovered, the handles break and the blades are fragile.  Just how fragile?  Check Home Depot's website for feedback on this very lopper and you'll even see pictures of the chipped Titanium blade.  It happens a lot, a whole lot.  Quality control may well be to blame, but the material used in the titanium blade is just not solid or steel.  My blade broke or rather chipped the first week of use and the broken surface revealed something that looks like pot metal.  The material in the blade looks like a composite, a grainy composite.  If you look at the blade you'll see that's it's very hefty and designed to withstand a direct applied force, but apparently not a force related to twisting, which would act against the cutting edge with increased leverage due to the unusual depth of the blade and its almost rectangular shape.  So you have high tech materials that when working, operates as advertised, save for that extra span needed to clear the blade around let's say a 2 inch branch.  BUT here's the good news:  Fiskars has replacement blades.  Here's the not so good news:  Fiskars charged me a reasonable $7.99 for the blade, but a very, very hefty shipping and handling ($4.00 for the handling) charge of $11.39, making the modestly priced blade $19.38 to purchase and receive.  The replacement blade (they're determined by the distance between the mounting holes)is steel and shaped like traditional lopper blades:  no more composites, no more thick blades, which tells you something.  As to Power Gear hedge shears, well , count your blessings with the lopper, because there ain't no replacement parts for the hedge shears from Fiskars, and their kink is the composite Power Gear mechanism, which breaks teeth with a passion, rendering the unit useless, unless you have a similarly wounded twin, because the mechanisms are comprised of two sets of power gear parts, that are interchangeable front and rear.  There you go, have fun.",1352678400,2012-11-12

5.0,"I developed algae in my pool that kept coming back, even after treating the algae with an algaecide.  Well, I finally learned that to rid your pool of algae you have to first rid it of phosphates because that it basically the food for your algae.  And if you don't remove the phosphates, the algae will keep coming back.So, I first started with Phos Free.  Not the one labeled Pool Perfect + Phos Free because that is just for maintenance.  Look for the one they call simply ""Phos Free"" (by the same company).  That is like a shock treatment to rapidly remove the phosphates from your water.  Just follow the directions on that product, and then once your phosphate levels are down to an acceptable level (zero is best, but I've been told up to 300ppm is acceptable) THEN you can start using the Pool Perfect + Phos Free product on a weekly basis to maintain it.I now add the Pool Perfect + Phos Free to my pool once a week, and have not seen any algae re-appear.  It's been a couple months since I started using it, and I am very happy with it.***P.S.  I originally bought this product from Leslie's Pool Supply, but I will never buy any product from them again after I found out that their website rating system is rigged.  They will NOT publish a review about a product if it is negative in the slightest bit.  They will only publish (or maybe even write themselves) a review for a product if it is positive, so you never know if you're reading accurate/fair reviews or not.  I have emailed their corportate headquarters about this numberous times regarding my concern over why only my positive reviews are showing up on their website, but they haven't fixed the problem and don't even have the courtesy to respond.

4.0,"I picked this vertical roaster for multiple reasons. Like many other reviewers, I made a few beer-butt chickens that decided they would rather fall over and make a mess as opposed to stand up straight and tall and cook like a well-behaved poultry. Secondly, I own a couple of cookbooks buy Steven and when I saw that he endorsed this product, I took a leap of faith that he didn't back up a piece of junk.He did not.This is a small, but well made and solid piece that works great on my Weber One-Touch Silver charcoal grill. I usually roast 4 lbs. birds, and they fit on the apparatus snugly and securely. I have NOT used the included cup/infuser, only cans of cheaply priced domestic beers. The results have been great. I like to put a little onion or potato in the chicken's neck to help seal in the moisture, but that's me.The unit is stainless steel, and dishwasher safe and it cleans up nicely. The 12oz. beer cans fit securely in the ring, and it seems like a lot of thought went into the design accept in a couple of areas, which I'll get to in the next paragraph. The handles are secure enough where you can hold the whole thing chicken and all by one handle and not worry about it breaking or bending.The only cons that I have found are that the drip pan could stand to be a tad deeper and I wished the handles angles upwards a bit more because its tough to fit a gloved or mitted hand between the hot grill grate and the underside of the handle to lift the unit off the grill when its done.Other than that, job well done and I really recommend it! The additional separate can/infuser enhances the versatility of the device so you can flavor the bird with wine, OJ, sake, sodas, or broths. That's pretty cool.Happy grilling and enjoy your chicken-on-a-throne!",1281744000,2010-08-14

1.0,"We bought two gallons of Wet and Forget at Costco. Applied per directions to some very moldy/ mildewey wood decking as well as a very mildewey painted wall and waited as directed. After 3 months of zero improvement, we applied again and scrubbed with a brush, (but did not rinse). This loosened up about 50% of the black mildew and with the next rains, it rinsed away. One year later, we can see some minor ""peeling"" effect of the remaining mildew layer on about 25% of the deck, but most of the deck simply returned to it's original back nastiness. I would say that the mildew has actually gotten worse over the last year, not better. We finally pressure washed it and then reapplied the wet and forget thinking that it might help prevent the return on the black mildew, but it hasn't. In the deck areas that get hit by the sprinklers, the wood is black again after only 4 months. The moldy wall never improved beyond our scrubbing efforts despite reapplication of the Wet and Forget. I don't know if the product just can't perform in extreme hot/humid conditions like South Florida or we got a bad batch, but I would not recommend this product. We went back to pressure washing after one year of trial with Wet and Forget. Pressure washing takes about the same amount of time to do as applying W&F and results are instant and beautiful.",1294272000,2011-01-06
5.0,"Personally I hate killing anything. I often trap bugs and let them go outside unless they are the stinging or biting kind. Wasps don't make good pets. :-) So anyhow onto the mouse thing. I was using the usual spring loaded mouse traps. We get about 6 to 8 of the critters that move into the house in the fall looking for a good place to get warm and find food. I set traps in the kitchen which is where they come out when the lights go off, or when there isn't any activity in the room for a while. I hate it when I am sitting in the living room and I hear the trap snap because I know there is some mouse stuck in there fighting for his life until he is suffocated from a blocked wind pipe.I finally broke down and bought a Hav-A-Hart trap.Havahart 1020 Live Animal Two-Door Mouse Cage TrapFor the first week they wouldn't go in it even though it was loaded with peanut butter, and then finally I caught one. It seemed like after that I was catching one per night. I am only surmising this but I think since the mouse was in the trap all night and alive that the mouse dropping and whatever tainted the trap, and then other mice figured this is where everyone goes. The only problem with Havahart traps is that you need to go for a ride in the car to drop off the trapped critter. If you just let them go outside in your yard they already know the way back in. In some states it is illegal to release them which brings me to the next subject and that is just how dangerous mice are.My father's sister's daughter had a child who was playing with a ball that a mouse had urinated on and then the child put his hands into his mouth and died from the disease he caught from the mouse. The big plague that hit the US in the early 1900's that killed people like they were flies, and no one could figure out how it was getting spread until they finally figured it out; it was being spread by the fleas that were on the mice. The mice would enter the home with fleas, and then the fleas would setup residence in the home, and when they bit the people they got the plague. So they eradicated the mice and the plague stopped. So that is why in some states it is illegal to capture and release mice.So just how good is the Victor Pro Electronic mouse trap? It is April now so mice are rarer than they are in the fall, but I did see some dropping so I knew at least one got in. So what I did was spread some peanut butter on the inside of the trap. Let me stop right there. There isn't any ideal place to put the peanut butter other than on the every end of the trap all the way inside. That end plate has a bunch of little holes in it. So when you put the peanut butter in there, what happened in my case is a mouse came up from the outside, and stuck his tongue in the holes and licked the sampling of peanut butter, but did not go around the other end of the trap end enter. A whole week went by and still no one entered. So I finally created a choice. I placed the used Havahart trap down, and both of them sat side by side, and the very next morning there was a mouse in the Havahart. In all fairness it took a week in order to get them to go in the Havahart as well. So this experiment is not exactly what I would call clinical conditions.My impression what that the entrance to the trap looked kind of small and ominous. It is dark inside. It is a narrow pathway. There isn't anything inside for a mouse to feel like other mice have been there. Maybe if I baited them part way into the trap and then got a few droppings around, or in it that would have produced better results. So all in the entire mouse catching, or disposing problem is just that a problem. My main attraction to the Victor is that after the fall harvest of mice catching is done, this may be a good, and more attractive way to leave something set in order to catch that stray mouse. It is kind of a set it and forget it. Since others have had success with it, I am sure after a while it would work, and then just like the Havahart it would become a very efficient killing machine.The one thing that is very important here is that mice like to go where your food is. They are not potty trained so if you leave food out they will crawl all over it and drop what could be a life threatening package onto your food. Mice are not to be taken lightly no matter how cute they are. Even their droppings on the floor that dehydrate and them become powder only to be swept up causing a little cloud in the air; that can make you seriously sick as well. I think I am going to give the Victor a longer chance to work and try baiting it closer to the entrance. If I get much different results I will let you know.",1365811200,2013-04-13
3.0,"This feeder holds a lot of seeds, enough for a couple of days here. I've watched most every variety of birds who are so inclined to dine on the feed I use ( a common brand and variety) come to the feeder. From the Cardinals to the Nuthatches, none have reported any problems with perching or reaching the seed. I've even seen a Mourning Dove helping herself...albeit she was sitting sideways! The feeder is metal and heavy plastic. It's actually two feeders, one up, one down. Easy to fill. Steel multi-stranded wire to hold the feeder to the hanger and the nut on the top easily slides up to open the seed compartments. There's a pressure button that releases the nut to slide. It holds the dome top securely in place. Simple. A neutral bronze color. I don't know if the other visitors will be thwarted by the dome type top, it hasn't delayed the raccoon from helping himself, lol. The birds like it, I like it, it's sturdy, attractive, I recommend it.**Update - June 4, 2013: I must update my original review, a drop of two stars because: The steel cable that supports the feeder, while very strong, is coated with plastic to keep it from rusting. The sliding nut at the top that you press the release button and slide up to open the feeder has come apart and has made a wad of plastic about one inch from the top of the feeder bell. This means the slider nut will not slide past it, making it almost impossible to fill. I intend on removing the plastic coating with a knife, but anticipate that the result will be an easy slider, but a rusty then rusted through, cable. YES, I depressed the button to clear the cable. It worked fine for a few refills, but then after the plastic tore and wadded up, it doesn't work. It's still a good feeder, the birds like it.",1369267200,2013-05-23

5.0,"We've been using the Rat Zapper Classic for at least a year under an outdoor roofed area that the wild wood rats of our area like.  It has been very useful in week after week continuing to elimiate rats, using cashews or pistachios as bait.This model, the Rat Zapper Ultra, is even better, because:- It uses D rather than AA, so lasts even longer- You can buy an optional indicator light, so that you can see from a distance when the trap has been tripped.(Previously we tried the cheaper Harbor Freight Tools knock-off of the rat zapper, and it would kill only a few rats with each set of batteries, and then it finally quit working.  So while I usually have good luck with well-chosen Harbor Freight products, this was not one of them.)I think the reason it is suggested for indoor use only is that the moisture of dew or rain could trigger the trap.  We're going to try it on some of our driveway rats (that like to nest in the engine compartment and chew the insulation off all the wires in the winter), but will first attach it to some wood to elevate it above flowing rain water as well as make it too heavy for the racoons to carry off, and will use it only under the shelter of our car engines.Note:  It makes a real difference to use the special Eveready E2 Lithium batteries that they recommend, though it looks like the name has been changed to Eveready Ultimate Lithium.  Regular alkaline batter just do not last as long, and the risk is that the rats will get zapped but not killed, and thus learn to avoid the trap entirely.",1377820800,2013-08-30
3.0,"The outputs are a 5v USB, which you will need to provide your own cable forA 12v to charge devices that are usually charged by the 12v output of a vehicle (car/truck/etc)and a Guide 10 output that can be used to charge the Guide 10 Plus Recharger which you would need to buy separately.From what I can tell from the product information on Amazon and on the Goal Zero website, you might be able to charge  the Goal Zero Switch 8 from the Guide 10 output, but I am not 100% sure about the Zero Switch 8 as I did not have that device on hand to test.The charging times for devices that you can charge from this are extremely optimistic, as predicted by the manufacturer's estimates, as they give a shorter time to recharge using this as compared to a consistent charge from a USB port. Realistically it would be extremely difficult in most situations to obtain maximum charging power from using the Nomad 7 since it was frequently difficult to get full sun even in Texas over the last couple of months.To gain full use of this solar panel, you would really need to buy either or both of the charge packs that work with this.It can charge the Rock Out 2 Rechargeable Speaker and the Lighthouse 250 Lantern, but for non Goal Zero devices you really need to be sure that they are compatible with 5v.

We're reluctant to spray them with anything heavy duty, since we have to share the house with any toxic fumes.Insecticidal soap, like this product, has the advantage of being completely harmless to mammals. No problems with your cat, dog or child. The manufacturers claim that it's safe on food crops as well.However, you need to be aware of a few things:Insecticidal soap works by direct contact with the beasties. Don't expect it to work if you spray it before you see the infestation.Quite a few plants won't tolerate soap (including Maples, Viburnum and Camellias). Check the label on the bottle before using it.Fish don't like soap. Keep it away from your pond or tank.This product also includes sulphur, as a preventative against fungus. Remember that fungicides are only preventatives - not cures: it's too late to use it if you can already see the symptoms. Some plants don't appreciate sulphur, particularly under drought conditions. Again, look to the directions on the bottle.It's too early to say whether this insecticide will work. I suspect that it won't be as effective as a good systemic, but I'll give it its best shot over the summer. I'll update this review with my findings.",1304640000,2011-05-06
3.0,"I bought two of these and have used them several times now, and there is no distinguishable difference between these and a standard $5-$7 oven mitt where it REALLY counts, protection when touching/carrying hot cookware straight off the grill or out of the oven. The heat from very hot items penetrates these pricey little boogers just as quickly as it does standard oven mitts. You won't be lifting your hot cast iron bbq grate out of your grill with these... not more than once, anyway.While you can get pretty much the same amount of thermal protection from cheapo oven mitts, having articulated thumbs and fingers might just make the expense of these worth it to you, but only marginally. The form factor does have advantages over oven mitts, for the same reason that most people prefer gloves over mittens in cold weather: dexterity. While oven mitts can be a little on the clumsy side, these do allow your hands and fingers to work as they are meant to, and that can come in handy, ie when using grill tools like tongs.The gloves are very large in appearance, but not so much that the size gets in the way when working. In spite of their large appearance, the fit inside is extremely snug on an average size man's hand. You actually have to work to get them on all the way.Bottom line: I think they're a little overhyped in most of the reviews here, and a little overpriced based purely on the thermal protection they provide. I'm sure the glove design explains some of the price, but the protection doesn't justify it in my opinion. You might wanna consider them for use as winter gloves though, I think they'd be great for that!I hope some of you find my review helpful in making a more well informed purchasing decision! Peace to all reading :-)",1343260800,2012-07-26
3.0,"This review will be a little different as it will be a while before I can actually plant these. Why? Look at where I live. Yes, we now hold the record for widest Tornado ever recorded. My garden is a swamp at the moment. But since I received this as part of the Vine program, I am required to review it. So I will start with a review of the product alone and will update it as I am able to plant the pods and continue updates through harvest.The pods themselves are an ingenious design; Peat pots containing your seeds, fertilizer and growing mix. Just peel off the paper cover and literally stick them in the ground. If you have ever planted seeds, you know just how small some are, how difficult it can be to get them at just the right height and how frustrating it can be to see birds in your garden digging them back up.The biggest negative with these is that I don't know what I am planting. I want to know what kind of tomatoes I am growing. Different types have different disease resistance, grow to different size and produce different types of tomatoes. The name alone tells me all I need to know; Celebrity=Disease Resistant, Super Fantastic=Set fruit in Hot Weather, Brandywine=Heirloom with Great Flavor. Not including the name of each plant also means I do not know how long it will take till harvest, how big the plant will eventually get and if it needs any special care. Brandywine tomatoes have no disease resistance will need to be protected from common tomato diseases.Also keep in mind that even though the pod has fertilizer, different plants have different needs when it comes to micro-nutrients. Tomatoes need calcium and magnesium to develop properly and this will need to be amended to your soil with bone meal and add some Epson salts as they grow.I will continue this review when my swamp is a garden again and I can plant these.",1370390400,2013-06-05

I have alread reviewed the pole trimmer and the weed trimmer.  I finally have time to review the Hedge Trimmer.  I like it the most of all the cordless products, because it performs as well as a corded hedge trimmer.  The hedge trimmer gets the most use as the foundation bushes are trimmed at least once every other month.  We can go around our house on one battery and still have juice left over.  The trimmer is light enough that my wife can use it without my help (YEA).  That was not true of our corded trimmer.  The bar length is great and I have never had a problem with the trimmer's power.  The trimmer only comes with one battery, but my experience says that would not be a problem.  I have four batteries, because of the other trimmers.  I rotate them and keep them inside.

5.0,"UPDATE #2:  I contacted Teho with their toll-free phone number and told them about the problem with the pruner.  My first surprise was learning that I was talking to someone not only in the United States, but actually at the Teho company headquarters (kind of sad that that's so surprising nowadays).  The customer service rep agreed that the pruner should not have had this issue and promised to send a new one -- which arrived the very next day, charged up and ready to go.  How nice to have a company stand so rock-solid behind their products.  My faith in the products is restored, and I'm really glad to have the pruner again!UPDATE #1: I used the pruner about 10 times last year, then stored it according to the instructions (no freezing, charge every 6 months). Took it out for the first time today and it no longer works. The spotlight comes on, but that's all. I will replace it, but not with this brand.ORIGINAL:I've done reviews where I wished I could give the product less than 1 star, but this is the first one that's made me wish I could give 6!  I love this garden set.  It's on my Top 10 list of gadgets I would replace immediately if they stopped working.I had an old set with a small hedge trimmer like this, so my expectations were pretty realistic, and the trimmer met them easily.  I used it on a variety of yew, juniper, and boxwood shrubs as well as a couple deciduous bushes.  Like all smaller trimmers, I wouldn't want to use this for major hedge trimming, but it can't be beat for smaller work and detailing.  I have a porch railing with evergreen shrubs in front of it, which eventually grow through the spindles.  It was perfect for finessing between the shrub and the porch railing to cut that growth back.  I trimmed for about an hour and noticed it was beginning to lose power slightly, but so was I.  An hour is just about perfect for me.The grass shear was very quick and effective.  I have a large flower bed with grape hyacinths along the edge, and if you have grape hyacinths you know the greenery continues to grow after they have finished their spring bloom.  I have to cut them back occasionally to keep the bed looking neat, and the shears were just the ticket.  The one thing I would have wished for is an extension handle so I wouldn't have to do all the shearing bent over or on my knees.This is the first time I've tried a powered pruner, and it was my favorite of all.  It took a little getting used to, since there is a moment's hesitation between squeezing the handle and making the cut; I'm used to a regular pruner that snips as soon as you close the handle.  However, it made effortless good, clean cuts on any branch small enough to fit between the jaws (and a couple times when I got over-ambitious, I ended up snipping through with two or three cuts, then cleaning up the edge, and it did fine for that, too).  I pruned a very old, woody Chinese tree peony and an overgrown Contorta and soon had a whole garden cart full of trimmings, with the pruner still raring to go.The one other wish I'd have would be for two chargers so both the pruner and the trimmer/grass shear handle could charge at the same time.  However, they charge quickly and hold a charge for a long time off the charger, so this really hasn't been a limitation.  I just like the set so much that I want to be positive it's always ready to go!",1374624000,2013-07-24

5.0,"Weber 6631001 Genesis E-330 Natural Gas Grill, BlackFirst let me say that anyone who owns there own home (and has natural gas service) should spring for the NG version. Some say that LP burns hotter than NG - I can't comment about that - but I can tell you that with the 4 burns wide open the unit reached almost 800 degrees in less than 15 minutes, air temp was at most 60.Plus you'll save a boatload of money and never run out of fuel again.Next, I strongly recommend you buy the E 330 not the ES 330. The E comes with porcelain coated cast iron grates whereas the ES grates are SS.SS may be resistant to rusting but they are inferior in their cooking qualities.  SS takes forever to get hot, does not retain heat like cast iron.SS grates won't mark the meat like Cast Iron does. Also, food will stick more to SS and are more difficult to clean.Back to the grill, it simply the best grill you can get for the price. Weber doesn't sell on price - it sells on solid design, top quality and unparalleled product support. Weber prices are pretty much the same everywhere - so buying it from Amazon there was a no brainer. There was no sales tax and it shipped free with my Prime membership & I received it in 2 business days.There are lots of grills out there that are cheaper and they are all cheaper but none are better.

5.0,"When my wife bought this based on a TV infomercial, I was skeptical because many products shown on TV simply do not work the same when you try them at home (I know because we have our fair share). But this product was a pleasant surprise. It was easy to use and worked quite well at cleaning our backyard gas grill.Simply fill the Grill Daddy with water, pre-heat your grill (I recommend with the cover closed) for ten minutes, then turn it off and use the Grill Daddy. As the water comes out it turns to steam and makes cleaning the grill a snap with a little ""elbow grease."" There are two cleaning heads: a brush that works with the steam, and metal wires for more heavy duty scraping and cleaning between the grates.I suggest you wear a cooking mitt when you clean the grill to avoid burning yourself with the steam.Although this product is made of plastic, which obviously is susceptible to heat, this was not a problem in cleaning the grill. As long as you don't touch the grill with the plastic, you don't have to worry about it melting.This is much easier and more effective than using an ordinary brush. The water not only creates steam that helps remove the buildup, but also reduces the friction of rubbing, so you don't have to exert as much effort as with an ordinary brush.Bottom Line: This is a very simple way to clean your grill with a minimum of effort, and you will see that it is much cleaner than if you had used an ordinary brush.Update September 8, 2012: My original Grill Daddy ""walked off"" so I had to buy a new one. It works just as well, and seems even sturdier than the original one that I bought three years ago. I recently got a Bull Brahma grill that has five different burners and lots of cooking surface to clean. The Grill Daddy makes cleanup a breeze.",1249344000,2009-08-04
3.0,"From fresh water to pressure washing gear, I've probably used just about every Swan hose that was ever made. For the most part overall quality has been good. If there was a weakness to any of their products it was the couplings on their cheaper hoses. I haven't had that problem in recent years. Swan makes almost every American made hose out there. That includes this Scott MaxFlex hose. So it was a no brainer to take this one for a test run. After four weeks use these are my thoughts.Timing was perfect. I was going to replace my older camping hose anyway. Measuring in at 5/8"" x 50' and weighing a little over seven pounds this Scott version is lighter then my older hose. I'm alright with that. The lead free aluminum couplings are not new features by any means. Most of Swan's hoses have been outfitted with these for quite some time. Still it works. I like the re-enforced vinyl covering. Unlike the cheap imported knock offs, its first rate and won't fray or peel. I can even live with the yellow line.On my first real test I laid the hose out to the max. I ran water through it a couple of times and drained it. Unfortunately the lay flat technology didn't show up. Even with the hose filled with water it still has a tendency to kink. For fresh water use its treated with bacteria and mold inhibitors. Still nothing gets rid of the taste of a new hose except constant use. I broke out this hose on several occasions since my initial test. Same kinking problem. For me personally I find this hose to be an average tool for camping or light gardening.The couplings on this product are first rate and definitely the best part of this hose. Still, this hose is too light for heavy duty use. Besides the constant kinking, a big ping against this particular product is the price tag for a 50' light duty hose. Its way overpriced for what it does not provide.",1393977600,2014-03-05
3.0,"When a rat discovered the bird feeder, we decided to try this trap and see if we could relocate it.  It was a pretty good size, probably from the steady diet of bird seed, but it was still smaller than the rabbits that keep the yard trimmed.  There are also a half a dozen squirrels that hang around the feeder, but our goal was the rat.We baited this trap with peanut butter and put it directly under the bird feeder.  I was a little worried about finding a bird in there, but the birds weren't interested.The rabbits were interested, though.  I've lost track of the number of times I've seen a rabbit wedged into this trap.  Happily, even though the rabbits are almost too big to fit, they've never triggered the trap.  And watching them wriggle out backwards is hilarious.Nothing else has triggered the trap either.  After replacing the peanut butter about 6 times, I gently touched the trigger to be sure we had set it correctly.  We had--the doors snapped shut.Mechanically, it seems to work.  It is easy to set and easy to release.  It doesn't seem to require a lot of pressure to trigger the trap.  It is also apparently easy for the local rodents and rabbits to take the bait without triggering the trap.  It's a great idea, but it hasn't worked for us.",1402963200,2014-06-17

5.0,"Recently I tried repotting a succulent using the Garden Genius and was happy I did.  The product is practical, inexpensive and easy to use.  First it is lightweight, can be cut to size, alleviates the need for filler like rocks or Styrofoam pellets or excess soil.  I was amazed that it was ultra light, sort of like a filter for other products, which will probably allow decent air flow.  It's easy to cut, if necessary.  Since I sometimes like to move my pots, I like the fact that the pots are less weighty for me to handle. After running it under water before using it, I could see that the drainage is good, as well.The cost of the product is also very reasonable and the Genius comes it various sizes.  It fits easily in different size pots and if you need to repot a plant,  just take  the Garden Genius out easily, not like pellets or rocks, then wash and reuse.  It's so simple. Of course, it can be used in both indoor and outdoor plants and be adapted to any container very quickly.  I know I will buy more.

4.0,"I have tried numerous skewers over the years:  flat, round, wood, and metal, with varying success.  I have burnt bamboo skewers and had food slide of and into the fire during dinner parties.  I really need some good skewers.  Here are my initial thoughts on these:Pros:The prong tips are sharp enough to pierce meat and vegetables, but not so sharp they are a danger in a drawer.  They came shipped with plastic tip protectors, which look like they are designed to be thrown away and if not will certainly get lost. Plastic straws work well as covers.The prongs are big enough to hold heavy cubes of meat.The skewers are round, but because there are two of them food doesn't stay in one spot when you try to rotate it, a problem with some single-prong round skewers.There is a disk that is supposed to help push the food off the skewer and little bumps near the front that appear to be designed to keep food from slipping off.  The success of these features is dependent on what you are cooking.  Some foods will stick to the skewer and some (like tomatoes) will always try to escape. Never trust a tomato.They feel solid and are said to be dishwasher safe (but hand washing is recommended).  They are too new to determine how well they will hold up over time, but they look like they will last a long while.Cons:It is difficult to use these with a closed grill if you want to cook four sides of a kabob. When sideways the skewers keep the top propped open. Things with only two cooking surfaces, like shrimp, would work well.The prongs are too big for the smaller chunks or strips of meat that I would normally cook on two sides. Bamboo skewers just work better for thinly sliced meats like satays.Because I normally use skewers for big chunks of steak (which I want cooked on four sides)or strips of chicken (which won't fit very well on these large skewers) these skewers won't be the first ones I reach for.  They are excellent for the right applications. If you are a big shrimp griller, these would be great.",1266796800,2010-02-22

2.0,"I have to say that I am at fault for this one. I must have taken my stupid pills the day I requested these. For some reason I was thinking that ""electronic"" meant that there would be a sound deterrent or a light or something besides a shock. I should have read further before ordering.These were easy to assemble and install the batteries which were provided. My happiness ends there.The first thing that makes no sense is the ""lure"" that is applied to the tops of these. As a long time landscaper I learned eons ago that you never intentionally ""lure"" whatever you are trying to avoid (i.e. japansese beetle traps). Only frustration and madness lie that way. So in order for these to work, you have to lure the deer to your yard so they can essentially stick their noses in the scent and therefore get this mild shock. It is all about training the animal as you would a dog with invisible fence.As someone who lives in a heavily wooded area I can tell you from nearly 30 years of experience that if a critter wants it, they will get it. Short of a physical barrier they will find a way around.These may be OK for someone in a suburban area, but if you have kids that are touching things these would be a no go.I'll keep spraying repellent and letting ""nature take it's course"".",1304467200,2011-05-04
2.0,"This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients.  It even looks like pepper, and smells somewhat like pepper.  The three main, active ingredients are:#1.  Oil of black pepper:  0.48% by weight.#2.  Piperine (comes from black pepper): 0.185% by weight.#3.  Capsaicin: 0.032% by weight.The other 99.3% are ""other ingredients"".When you open the big blue jug, please note, it is five pounds by weight, but the jug is about 3/4 full, so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.I used it around the perimeter of my home, which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats, chipmunks, and deer.  I also have a pet dog and cat.  I did not expect miracles, and as with any product of this type, you need to accept that it is a deterrent, which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors, nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals, I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times.  Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property.  I tried a couple of applications in various places.  None of the chipmunks, cats, squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all.  I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions.  In fact, I ended up applying it heavier than instructed, and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.But, if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach, I do not see any reason to pay $5 or $6 a pound for this product.  5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces.  Since the active ingredients (various forms of pepper) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar, or about half an ounce, you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own, homemade powder for far less.For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs, I use a mixture of tap water, some chili powder and one egg (left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle), along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion.  So you could possibly not use the egg (attracts some animals, even when rotten) and add a little more pepper, dish soap or baking soda.  You'd end up with something that would work as well as this product.",1345075200,2012-08-16

5.0,"I use this product primarily to keep aphids off my broccoli, cabbage, onions, kale, and plum tree.  So far, I've had a lot of good success with it and it hasn't damaged my plants like some other products that I've used in the past.  There's a couple of tricks to this product.  First, most of the pests congregate on the bottom-side of leaves so you need to have a strategy to access and spray the bottom-side.  Spraying the topside of the leaves is a waste of time and won't do anything for you.  My method of getting to the underside of the leaves without being a contortionist is to use a pump sprayer that has a wand with an angled tip.  TheSecond, don't be cheap.  Once you access the underside of the leaves, give them a good spray and make sure all critters are fully soaked.  Ever notice how your hands feel dry if you wash them often with soap?  That's exactly how this product works...it ""dries out"" the critters.  That's why it's so important to make sure the critters are fully soaked.  As an added bonus, I've realized that this product can also kill soft bodied green caterpillars that also love to chew on most plant leaves.  I'm now regularly spraying my apple and cherry trees with this product to get rid of the caterpillars; the only trick is that you have to catch them in the act.Buying the concentrate is the way to go from a $$ perspective.  It's not that hard to make a spray solution.  I use 4 tbsp of the product in a 1 gallon pump bottle and then fill it up to the top with water.  Shake well and you're ready to go.  A funnel is not necessary but certainly makes it easier to fill the bottle without getting the concentrate or water everywhere.  Depending on the level of infestation you have, you can adjust the concentration up or down by adding a few more or a few less tbsp of the concentrate.  I recommend starting at a lower concentration (i.e. 2 tbsp/gallon of water) and working your way up based on an assessment of how effective the previous spraying was.",1369612800,2013-05-27
5.0,This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years.,1313107200,2011-08-12
5.0,Finally a fairly well built bird feeder. This holds a nice amount of seed. Seems to be well constructed and I think it will do well against the squirrel onslaughts. I gave this 5 stars because of a really neat feature this feeder has. The bottom panel of it comes out for cleaning. So much easier than trying to stick a coat hanger down the tube and stabbing around to loosen the seed that is stuck and wet. This feeder has an easily removable metal clip ring that comes out and frees the bottom plate in the feeder. Great design!,1393632000,2014-03-01
5.0,"The Terro T3400 Home Insect Killer does just what it says. It kills insects. The main ingredient is Deltamethrin which is considered a safe pesticide. The one gallon container is ready-to-use  with an attached spray hose. Just attach the hose into the cap and you are ready to spray. The spray nozzle has a narrow setting or a broader setting for easy application. This insect killer can be used indoors or outside to kill all kinds of insects such as ants, silverfish, ticks, flies, cockroaches and up to 65 different types of insects. It will last for months. I would recommend this insect killer to anyone who has an insect problem.",1372982400,2013-07-05

4.0,"I have a relative who owns this tool and it is great, so I picked one up. It cuts through everything it is advertised for and makes yard pruning a lot easier and manageable than if it was done manual with shears or by hand. Some of the negative reviews are correct in saying that the chain does fall off occasionally, but not enough to the point where I will bash the items design (once very 100 uses or so, didn't really keep count). Some of the wood chips do get stuck in the crevices of the mouth, but hey every tool needs its maintenance. As far as the bad reviews about the oil being a mess and nuisance, a little goes a long way.For me the PROS definitely weigh out the CONS in this product. If you are on the fence about getting this or a small chainsaw I would say go with the chainsaw because you will not like this product. Me, I have both so I use which ever the job at hand requires.",1390176000,2014-01-20

He said this was a great price as well (I haven't ever purchased before, so I trust him)I will update if the flowers don't thrive.

4.0,"Packaging and Assembly:The package arrived in a pretty beat up condition as it was shipped without a protective box, and it is made of very thin cardboard. Fortunately, the unit inside was unscathed. Assembly effort was minimal, consisting of attaching the front handle and the guard.Some thoughts:1. It has great torque. You can feel it thrum with a lot of power, and it's more than sufficient for prairie grass and other thicker weeds.2. Since it works on electricity, you really need a decent length extension cable to make it work. I have a 100' cable and that lets me get to where I need to go without continually moving the power plug.3. It has a very simple design to prevent the plug coming off of the socket on the GH710. I initially was too lazy to use the approach, but after a few times of having it yanked out, did so. I didn't have a single mishap after that.4. The handle adjust is really easy to use - you simply unscrew a lock, pull to extend the handle, and then screw the lock back in.For its price, this trimmer works exactly as advertised.Happy Trimming!",1313366400,2011-08-15

I have it on the deck where my six cats can watch the birds as they feed. The birds love this feeder since it is more stable that the hanging feeders and the cats love to watch the birds.

5.0,This product is spot on for getting to those small spaces where you need a focused stream of weed killer.  It is perfect for along fences and other tight places.  I have flower beds right beside all of my fences and this product kills the weeds and leaves the flowers alive.  it has a very focused foaming spray that hits where you want and does not spread.  On top of that the price at 2.98 is very reasonable.  It worked on my entire fence line and still had a little left over.,1396656000,2014-04-05
5.0,"For humane critter traps, this is the best trap we've used yet. Because of the double doors and open ends it is the most effective as cats and raccoons, two particularly wily critters who are good at avoiding corners, so to speak will enter without a second thought. The cage is solid! So once a critter is caught not only does it hold but it is heavy enough that the animal can't thrash it about and hurt itself. And finally it is humane. Because it is a live trap critters can be relocated without any harm done and the doors can be opened so that you, yourself can stand clear.Worth the investment and will give you a clear conscience.",1366848000,2013-04-25

Bear in mind, some areas do not allow transfer of animals from one location to another to limit spread of disease.SetupDepending upon what you're trying to catch, you place the appropriate bait distal to the lever in the compartment of trap.  I am catching raccoons, and they enjoy, fish, crispy bacon, nuts and marshmallows.  The trap is a little tricky to set up.  Lift the metal gate and secure a small latch that connects to a slot in the door.I have a recommendation with regards to placement.  Because the floor is open, I recommend placing this on a piece of cement or plywood.  It will keep you from having to dig out a lot of dirt, which I have done.The trap is durable and will keep your critter secure.ConclusionI caught my first raccoon on the first night.  Worked like a charm.Highly recommend.",1405382400,2014-07-15
5.0,This system is great. The measuring cup is made from very sturdy plastic and the brush itself is very solid and heavy. The brush rests in the top of the cup so you don't make a mess anywhere. The handle is also long enough to allow you to sauce your meats while they are still on the grill without burning your fingers. If you don't care about the convenience of the measuring cup you can save a little bit of money by buying the brush separate and just using a bowl but the measuring cup is very useful so I think it's worth it.,1284854400,2010-09-19

4.0,"I recently moved into the Texas Hill Country and have come to experience the daily devastation of plants caused by rabbits and deer. I started buying deer-resistant plants but it turns out that deer don't read the approved lists and eat most of them anyway. Then come the rabbits who arrive as packs of fluffy little plant chainsaws ready to destroy anything the deer missed. It's a monumental pain in the ass and short of building cages around the plants, solutions are hard to come by.This spray is easy to apply and overall does seem to improve the carnage. It works by basically creating an unpleasant odor in the area that the animals don't like and they choose to go somewhere else (hopefully your neighbors aren't using the same product). I've definitely seen fewer deer and rabbits (I have no idea where the squirrels were in the first place) since applying this mixture, so using this very unscientific method I believe it's had an impact.But here's the rub: when you have brutal drought conditions as we've had here for the last 2 years, these critters will pretty much go through any barriers you attempt to employ to deter them. As one neighbor commented to me, ""When there's no water, deer will eat anything - and your fancy sprays are like salad dressing to them."" I hadn't thought about my garden as a buffet but it's a fair point. So I consider this another tool in my arsenal, rather than a complete solution, in the daily battle to save my plants.",1344988800,2012-08-15
5.0,"This is a pretty cool set.  The vendor sent me a set of these skewers and mats to evaluate and review.  I loved them so much that I bought a second set so I'd have four of the skewers.First I have to confess that I haven't used the mats yet.  I haven't quite found the right use for them, plus I keep my grill pretty hot and these are only for use up to 500 degrees.  The skewers though, oh the skewers...I made a nice big set of kebabs for my family and quickly realized that I can't recall the last time I made kebabs.  Why not?  Because I've always had such horrible luck with them.  I have such a hard time turning the kebabs without just having the chunks of stuff twirl around on the skewers.  So the food cooks unevenly and a lot of the pieces even fall off.  That's no good at all.  But these skewers loop around on themselves to make a complete ring, which means that it's very simple to turn them over:  just grab the pointy end with your tongs and gently turn the whole business over (use a spatula to support the other end if you're worried about being too rough with them).These wire skewers are nice and long.  Each one is the equivalent of two or two and a half of the regular wooden skewers that we typically use.  So each one makes a perfect serving for one family member.I had a few fears with these loopy skewers:1) They'd be too hot to handle.2) They'd be too tough to clean.3) They'd be too unwieldy to store.I used tongs and a spatula to take everything off the grill.  Then I figured I'd need my heavy duty BBQ mitt to hold one end while I wrestled the kebabs off the lines, but by the time I got them into the kitchen and got down to business they had already cooled off.  Awesome!Then when it was time to do dishes I just soaped them up and used a sponge to scrub them.  They cleaned right up!When I was all done, I just coiled them up on themselves and they made a bundle about 6"" in diameter.  They fit in my BBQ cupboard just fine.Like I mentioned before, I got a set of these for free to evaluate, but I loved them so much that I bought another set so I'd have four for my family.  Adios wooden sticks!",1402963200,2014-06-17
2.0,"The big deal about this grill is its portability. But look at the shipping weight in the product details section: 71 pounds. Subtract some for the box and foam packing material, and it's still pretty close to 70 pounds. Now, realize that it has two 30-quart coolers stowed on the bottom, and add in the weight of the ice, drinks, and meat you'll put in those coolers. Bottom line: this thing is HEAVY and will likely take 2 people to handle and maneuver.Quality control on mine was a bit lacking: one of the coolers had its lid zipper sown improperly, leaving a 3-inch opening in the front when the zipper is closed. Also, the latch that is supposed to hold down the grill's lid in transit is completely ineffectual.The plastic side shelves do not fold down, as you might expect, but are separate pieces, designed to be pushed into place when you want to use the grill and pulled out and (I presume) nested together and placed inside the grill itself for transport. Very kludgy. (The instruction manual does not say a word about how to handle the shelves while transporting the grill.)There are two ""leveling feet"" on the front legs of the grill; the back legs rest on wheels. Leveling feet are a great idea for a portable grill; however, these each provide only one-quarter of an inch of adjustment! 1/4""! Whoever designed this thing must be used to some mighty smooth picnic grounds.The transport handle does NOT lock in the up position, meaning you are limited to dragging the grill behind you; if you try to push it, the handle collapses. This grill is wider than most doorways, including the one from my sun room to the back yard, so two people are required to move it sideways through the door. The gas regulator is easy to remove and install, but there is no place to stow it for transport. If you are supposed to also stow it inside the grill, I would expect it would damage the finish of the lid and/or grate.I should also mention that all that happens to make this grill ready for transport is that you push down the sides so that the bottom of the grill rests on top of the coolers. It's not all that compact, so you must have an SUV or pickup truck to transport this grill to any remote location.We still have snow on the ground so I haven't actually cooked anything on the grill yet. This review just covers build quality, which isn't up to what I would expect at this price. When I think what I could get for just a little more money:Char Broil M2 Four-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill, with Sideburner--sure, that one doesn't have the promise of portability, but how often will I really want to lug this one around? And after reading another review comments about how messy this one gets, I don't know if I really want to lug this one around.Some statistics without comment: Of the 6 5-star reviews on this page, 4 were written by people who have never reviewed anything else, and the other 2 people seem to specialize in reviewing Char-Broil products. None of those reviews have a statement from Amazon that the person owns the product; the reviews that do have such a statement give it 4 stars or less.",1267747200,2010-03-05

2.0,"Appearance:  the clip is designed to look like a plant leaf so is fair at camouflaging itself on a plant stem.  It's cute.Utility:  the clip is easy to spread open (as long it's already opened and not in the &#34;clicked&#34; closed position)and close around a plant stem with one hand while the other hand is holding the stem and stake with the other.  It's useful for plants whose stems don't grow more than a couple of centimeters in width.Although the package says it can secure tomato plants, I'm not sure what kind of tomatoes it could possibly mean.  The tomatoes that I grow in my garden can grow upwards of five feet high and the stems can grow to be two inches in diameter.  Although the clip is meant to release rather than &#34;choke&#34; a stem if the stem grows too thick, the  reason I clip a plant to a stake,  for security or stability of the plant, is then lost.  So, not so helpful if the plant stem has outgrown the clip which most of the plants in my garden have and will.The best use for the clips so far has been for small indoor plants such as bamboo and orchids(although a bit too big for the orchids).  I will try them next growing season for the vine plants such as cucumbers or peas and see how useful they are for securing them.",1385683200,2013-11-29

4.0,"The GreenView Ready2Go spreader certainly beats hauling out a rotary or drop spreader, pouring fertilizer in the hopper, pushing it around the yard and then putting the excess back in the bag. It essentially blows a pre-calibrated amount of fertilizer in front of you, with a fan. The spread is maybe a couple of feet forward and a cone-shaped pattern a foot or so wide. I found it necessary to wave the container back and forth as I was walking.When you get it, it looks as if the instructions are visible on the back label, but the real instructions are inside after you peel off the outer page. You first have to remove the bottom dispenser part, peel off a seal, and reinstall. The instructions say that you need to pull a tab that protects the batteries, but on the unit I received, there was no tab and the batteries had shaken loose during shipment and bent one of the terminal springs. So that was a few minutes of fussing with it to get the batteries back in place correctly.I noted that there was a plastic half-disc that rotated in the dispenser mechanism, seemingly unconnected to the on-off slider. It seemed to me that this could be used to regulate how fast the product dispensed, but the instructions were silent on that. Since GreenView claims it is pre-calibrated, and there's no marking on this disc, I have no idea if I was really putting down the correct amount of fertilizer.One can refill the jug with whatever kind of granulated fertilizer you want, which is nice, and the batteries are standard AA and replaceable.

NO MORE.The Nooski (noose, get it?) is a nifty, safe little gadget that is funny and cool. Two pieces: base has a little spot to put peanut butter into, and the ""launcher"" which is semi-clear plastic with a trigger: You roll the tiny circular collar over the launcher, and set it in place on the base. Mousey comes along, sticks head in to get the peanut butter and BOING! the band, stretched in place, gets snapped around mousey's neck. No blood, no mess, no poison.

4.0,"I live in the country.  Each fall a whole army of mice move into my heated garage.  I use a variety of traps and poisons to kill them as quickly as possible.  I have tried glue traps (cruel and disgusting), alligator-type snap traps (only good if the mouse enters straight-on - one didn't and was injured, not killed) and thed-CON 00027 Ultra Set Covered Mouse Trap.I hesitated in getting these traps because the description of all of the diseases mice carry seemed a little fear mongering.  Still, I thought I would see if they were in fact a better mouse trap.They appear to be a standard snap trap (like the d-CON) but with a door that closes when the trap is sprung.  Unlike the d-CON, it is impossible to empty the trap and re-set it if that is your choice. The mouse is completely encased in the trap, so you don't see it at all, unlike the other traps I use.The instructions are not well done.  There isn't any text, just pictures, and the instructions on baiting just show a knife with something on the blade tip.  If you don't know that peanut butter is the best bait, there is nothing to tell you that is what is on the knife.Baiting this trap is easy.  A plug comes out, you put the peanut butter on it, and you replace the plug.  Then you set the trap spring.One of the traps did not want to be set.  I turned the lever repeatedly and it didn't catch.  This is a common problem on the d-CON traps, so I knew to hold the trap upside down shake it until it sets.This is a great one-use trap for someone who isn't comfortable dealing with mice, which would have been me a few years ago.  I don't like that it cannot be re-used and will probably stick with the d-CON.  However, for some locations, like where kids or pets are around or in our main house, these are nice.",1291248000,2010-12-02
5.0,"Wow this works and it works well, maybe too well.  I had purchased Victor's last model.  I could not find it anywhere I was very disappointed. then I went back to check this one out and noticed it was very similar to the old one I used. The only difference was this one does not come with a ""shelter"" or covering.  You actually can see the little critter in the end.  I bought 6 and it arrived yesterday...I place three traps around the kitchen where they find their way in.  I used parmesan cheese since it is smelly and not very messy like peanut butter. I believe the cheese offers an odor they cannot resist, neither can I...You must be very careful when setting this up, it can snap and hurt you.  I snapped myself on the last one and it hurt for days.  I found that after I baited it and placed it down is when I pulled the bar up and engaged it.  It is a good idea to buy the multi pack since eventually the plastic will snap and break under the force of the spring..When I got up this morning I went to look.  The first one had mice droppings beside it and I wondered why it had not snapped especially since some of the cheese was nibbled off. Very curious.  But the next one under the sink had popped and turned over with the force of it. Clean kill and it was very simple to disengage the little fella and toss out.  I next looked at the third trap behind an appliance I put there, wow, this was messy, this I did not like the poor thing got hit and managed to crawl away and then it died a few inches away.  It was sad and I do not like it but when you find mice droppings you know they are there and when you see one there are many more.Mice are dirty little critters and carry sickness that I do not want in my home. LI live in the woods so I get many of them when the weather starts to get cold, they just wans  place to live but not in my house.. I have tried other traps and other ways but nothing has worked as well as this.  I have never caught more that one ever..

5.0,"Over the years we have turned our yard which is located in the woods and has an orchard, into a mini bird sanctuary.  With the addition of the feeder being reviewed here we have somewhere around 18 different feeding stations for the birds...actually, many of these stations are no more that cafeterias for squirrels (we have on my last estimation about 35 of the bushy tailed little rodents we feed), raccoons, possums and ever present field mice.  About 1/4th of our feeders are home made...the others commercial.Anyway, this tube type feeder is a bit larger that most we use and so fare I have been quite happy with it.  It holds a lot of seed and the two levels work quite well.  Once you get the hang of it, it is easy to fill and easy to clean...the cleaning is quite important with this feeder as it is with all feeders.This feeder is stout and well made and by the looks of it and the material used in making it, it should last for quite some time.  Now as to being squirrel proof...well, no it is not...not by a long way.  Very few feeders unless you go with the high dollar ones which are build like Fort Knox are completely squirrel proof.  I will say that this feeder is squirrel ""resistant"" and so far we have had much less of a problem with it than we have with many of our other feeders.This feeder, due to its size, allows larger birds access to the food than do many of the smaller tube feeders.  I know that many do not like this...in particular when it comes to blackbirds and Jays, but in our case we figure that those guys need to be fed just as much as the ""cute little things,"" so we really do not care.Overall we have been quite satisfied with this feeder and if problems pop up in the future I will update this review and address those problems.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",1369872000,2013-05-30

The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle, and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens, I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color.",1126915200,2005-09-17

4.0,"This OXO Good Grips Flip and Fold Omelet Turner was designed for making... omelets, made of eggs in a frying pan.

No melting yet!You have to make sure you have used enough butter, oil, or non-stick spray to keep the eggs from sticking.  The edge of this turner isn't stiff enough to be used as a spatula.  However, it is large enough that I use it like a soft spatula for frying veggies.  I haven't gotten brave enough to use it with tomato sauces, since I am afraid it will stain.

3.0,"The Fiskars 01-005692 Cuts+More 5-in-1 Multi-Purpose Scissors provide five functions that one may or may not need.  First I should say the scissors are great and the onboard sharpening gadget is a perfect accompaniment.  Both work very nicely and the quality is excellent.  Presuming the scissoring counts as one function and the sharpener as another, the remaining three seem to be some special notches and points built into the design.According to the list of things this tool is probably capable of--cutting twine, opening boxes, cutting wire, poking holes in things and yanking bottle caps off.  Who opens bottles with an opener these days?  Anyhow, an ordinary pair of scissors ought to do some of the same things.The Fiskars 5-in-1 scissors will probably do all of the things they are purported to do, but some of the features seem rather ordinary or would seldom be required--cutting rope for instance or dragging out this large tool in order to cut a thread.  The scissors come apart easily and this is supposed to be an advantageous thing, but I don't know why I would want to take my scissors apart even if it is easy to do.Don't get me wrong.  The Fiskars 5-in-1 scissors are very good scissors and they do have a few special somewhat useful indentations and pointy things on them.  The ergonomically sculpted finger and thumb loops are nice and the sharpening device is a big plus.  However, in the end--they are just a fancy pair of scissors with some extras that most people won't use everyday.",1306108800,2011-05-23

5.0,This is by far the best hummingbird feeder we have in our backyard. Hummingbirds are plenty here in our neighborhood and these birds love this feeder. The glorious red color with yellow flowers are a magnet for hummingbirds. The other two hummingbird feeders that we purchased from local Home-Depot also are from the same company Perky-Pet.

They love the fact that they can sprawl on it full length, eat out of the tray and because of the feeders size I can't see the darn squirrel.If you have smarter birds than I do, you will most likely LOVE this feeder.

5.0,"This edger does the job and more.  I give it my highest recommendation.I hadn't edged my lawn since last Fall when my gas-powered edger bit the dust.  We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida.  It propagates by spreading tough, vine-like runners.  I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.  This edger cut right through them, which I didn't expect, given the toughness of the grass.  But it never hesitated, except on some very stuborn growth.  I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.  I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I didn't want it to go.  Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets.  No more gas and oil mix, no more new spark plugs, no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start, and it's relatively quiet when running.  Just press the trigger and go.

1.0,"I've never heard of the company that's selling this.  And I'm glad, because when products like this, they'll be out of business VERY soon.I'm not going to detail every problem with this thing, but perhaps enumerate a few:1.  The stain is applied completely unevenly.  Some pieces are much darker, and there are run/splotch marks all over.2.  There is no protective material around anything in the box.  This leads to problems later in the life of the bench:a.  There are numerous spots all over that have had their stain rubbed nearly completely off.b.  A couple people come with pegs in them:  all but two come broken.c.  A long piece that appears to be provided for additional stability:  broken in the box (no visible damage to the box.)3.  The top wood grain in the picture looks nothing like what I have.  It's just more of the same ""stain"" glopped all over.4.  The wood pieces, especially the center support piece, doesn't line up correctly.  It's about an 1/4 of an inch too short.5.  Want to call the company to ask for spare pieces or warranty info?  Too bad for you:  there is no contact information anywhere, save for the outside of the box - the same place that has this product incorrectly labeled ""OUTER DOOR BENCH.""  The correct label:  a bunch of broken scrap wood.The only redeeming factor of this entire piece of garbage is that the instructions aren't confusing because of a bad translation:  there are a total of 4 words, and some weird picture/diagrams that aren't entirely accurate for putting this thing together.Don't waste your money on this.  It's absolutely horrible.  If you happen to get lucky and they figure out that padding small pieces during shipment is a good idea - and hire some QA for other aspects, it's still not a very good product:  most build-it-yourself pieces, when you screw them together, have the metal hardware generally hidden from view.  Not this gem:  the ""official"" pictures here appear to be some cheap 3D renderings and not an actual product picture; you can see screws in the legs and across the top ridge in the real thing.A bad design for a bench from a company that likely has no quality assurance.

4.0,"There are pluses and minuses with these clips.  They're roomy so you can use them on larger stems, and they're soft so they're less likely to bruise or otherwise damage those stems when you use them.  These are both good things in a plant clip.  However the softness does tend to make them seem rather flimsy.  I'll have to reserve judgment on this aspect until they've weathered a few seasons in the garden.I love the fact that they lock so that they can't be pulled off casually if the plant gets buffeted by the weather or marauding wildlife, though I confess the clips we've been using aren't easy to dislodge either, possibly because they need a good deal of force to open them.  However one problem I have with them is that in order to place them you have to move your hand rather further into the foliage than normal.  This isn't a huge problem for most plants but on some of my roses it's asking for a good bite.  (My girls don't take kindly to being constrained.)  Once I get the hang of them, I imagine it won't be much worse than any other sort of clip, but right now I'm a little skittish about them.  Thank goodness I have the winter to practice in.I think, overall, I'm going to like these clips.  I don't necessarily know that I'll like them all that much better than the ones I'm using but that isn't really an issue.  What works, works and that' the important thing in gardening.

The leather thong in the end is very strong and handy to loop over your wrist so you can keep the tool handy and still use both hands if need be. It's about 1 and 1/2 feet long and I've found this to be just the right size for working in the dirt around plants that are fairly close together. I can use this to get between the plants and loosen up the soil to pull weeds. The tines are steel and very strong so don't worry about bending them on very hard soil.

2.0,"Bought this about 4 years ago from another site (much more expensive). It worked well.The pole holding it gave out (wet soil from heavy rain and snow), and the feeder hit the ground (frozen grass). It literally smashed into about 10 pieces; I don't know if I even found them all.The interesting part of this story is that the thistle feeder hanging on the opposite hook of the pole and 2 poly rain rings (over the tops)  did NOT break. Only this feeder broke!! I suspect that it was either weather-worn, OR an old(ER) feeder with limited life to the plastic, OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.A few feet away, I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected (anchored in cement), i.e., NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame: an animal attack.I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement.FINALLY, they said that an animal probably got at it, but they couldn't guess which one. DUH. I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break, AND that the other barn style feeder, only a few feet away, was not touched, basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.Last email from mfgr: Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder!?I asked about the lifetime warrantee again.They asked for photos. I sent them.Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken.I wrote that they'd just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say.Answer: NO REPLACEMENT; must have been an animal attack (their words).BOTTOM LINE: Forget the lifetime support. They won't replace the feeder.Be ware of expecting any type of replacement or support from the company. The emails were almost accusative; really off-putting, as if to discourage further contact. And I had shown them a photo of the pole AND the other elements on it which did not break. We exchanged probably half a dozen emails.I'd like this feeder again, but I'll be d....d if I spend money on something which is NOT supported when the mfgr says that it is supported for a lifetime replacement.Whose lifetime? An ant's?Probably made of SHODDY MATERIAL with a limited life is my conclusion.The company will insist that ""some"" animal attacked it, and they don't support animal attacks.

4.0,"My wife is an avid gardener.  We have huge tomato plants that are supported by the wire cages that are sold everywhere, and do a good job up to certain point.  Tomatoes need support when the fruit starts to mature because of the weight.  She has always used tie ties, like on the packaging for a loaf of bread---just a pain to put on and take off at the end of the season.  These plant clips just make the job so much easier and can be used season after season and they do not cut into the plant--really nice.  She also uses them in the flower garden for holding the stems up to show off the bloom, just attach to the support rod or stick. So simple to use, place the clip around the stem and the support and snap closed; easy to move as the stems get longer.  If grandma only could have got her hands on these, she used string; but, that was a long time ago and these had not been born yet.

3.0,"I have a number of traps in my garage and I put this on a few of the mechanical ones and I haven't caught any mice so I can't confirm if it works or not. So far based on the results I would say it doesn't, In the past I used to try peanut butter. This stuff doesn't smell to bad, it is non-toxic which is nice and very easy to apply.

5.0,Nice light weight and powerful. The 36 volt lithium battery lasted close to 45 minutes on a charge. Has a nice blowing capacity and works well with any size area. Noise level is very minimal in comparison to electric or gas models. Very impressed compared to my 20 volt lithium unit that only lasts about 10-15 minutes on a charge.,1367107200,2013-04-28

5.0,"The tiny amount of the active ingredient is the growth hormone.  I believe it does work, but is not a 100% guarantee, either.  The effectiveness seems to vary by species of plant, too.  Much of this rooting work, from cuttings, seems to become more of an art in the hands of the person doing it.  The other factors of temperature, light, and moisture weigh heavily, too.In addition to the method that is described on the container, I have had good results by placing the stems to be rooted into a water bath (changed daily), after the initial dry exposure to this rooting compound.  Good luck!",1393545600,2014-02-28
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at how high quality / heavy duty this plant stand was when I received it.  It is very sturdy and looks nice.  The only part I do not like is there are exposed somewhat sharp metal ends where the decorative scrolls connect to the legs - you can see them sticking out and pointing downward in the picture.  In general, this is not a problem but clothes could get caught on them or skin could be scratched.  I am using this plant stand inside but it would also be a nice addition to a patio or on the front step.  I may have to get another to have a matching symmetric set for outside.  I would not hesitate to purchase another size or style of plant stand made by this company, assuming the same quality.",1342656000,2012-07-19
4.0,I had this set up in a snap. It works well on the squirrels but because of the way my garden is they can still bypass it and a few of them have figured it out. The unit is well built and sturdy.

5.0,"wow! At first I put this sideways so the indicator was up. I didn't read the instructions. The mice got in and took the bait and left, without triggering the trap. I was about to throw them out and try something else when, behold, I looked at the package and saw it was meant to stand upright. I re-set a new trap in that orientation and within 2 hours had caught my first mouse. Since this is a 2 pack, I fired up another one and got another mouse overnight. Now I wonder how many there are. I'm going to order 2 more and see. Good thing these come in a 2 pack. These mice had grown smart enough to avoid the old-fashioned wooden spring trap. But not this.",1300060800,2011-03-14
3.0,"First off, please read the instructions. The company selling these does an excellent job of providing healthy, live insects with fast shipping - after that, you need to read the instructions. Once you've read the instructions, you'll refrigerate your little winged buddies and spray them down with sugar water. Right? And you'll remember the time of day it suggests of course, no? If you deviate from the instructions, you'll release a small army of ladybugs that will vanish within minutes without a single aphid eaten.So we tried this twice. The first time was the ""don't read the manual"" version and they all left. The second time was more procedural but the truth is they don't stay present for long. I don't know if the aphids aren't sufficient as a snack, or if the sugar water wears off, or if they simply refuse to stay on a handful of plants, but the overall effect isn't very impressive.I was really hoping this would work but compared to a dose of Sevin, it's no comparison.

You can attach the &#34;giant foot&#34; to a rake, broom. or anything with a similar handle (although I don't recommend anything with a heavy end as this would make use awkward.)  It works better than bare hands as you can get better leverage and some distance from spiders and bugs,  But... you have to rely on your arm strength regardless and it can feel a bit awkward.  I find that if I stand on a step and use my own size 12 giant foot, I can still compress better than with the leaf stomper due to combined leg strength and weight.  My wife is a foot shorter than I am and cannot manage the &#34;leg in bag&#34; technique, so for her this is a bit more useful than I find it.",1386201600,2013-12-05

1.0,"We've tried just about all the traps out there - and basically, after tracking performance for about a year, the top performer in our warehouse was an old fashionedVictor Mouse TraporVictor Rat Trap.However, we had a trap-shy rat get inside the house. I was afraid it might be pregnant looking to nest (it *was*) and wanted to catch it quick before any pups were born. I tried D-Con poison only to learn that it could take up to 10 days for it to work, and I couldn't wait.I set several types of traps, including this one (I paid $4.98 at Lowes) since the bait cup is large & you can put anything in it. The rat initially came upstairs to seek out some large chunk dog food, and since it was trap-shy, I thought it would be best to bait it with something familiar (the dog food is too big/heavy for a traditional trap).After 8 days of eluding us, this method worked within 4 hours (I give as much credit to the bait as to the trap). But it did NOT kill - the neck was stuck between the teeth of the trap. In an old fashioned Victor trap, it snaps on the neck, not the head, which is instant & humane.This was in the kitchen, I was not home, and my wife was severely traumatized. It was flopping around everywhere, bleeding and contaminating *everything* in the kitchen, peeing and pooping everywhere. It's rear claws scratched up the cabinet doors. My wife had to lock up our dog & cats, who were curious but were in harms way. Awful, awful, awful. This was hours of cleanup, and it was terribly inhumane.With a few tweaks, this could be a superb trap. But it did not do the job, and this was just awful folks. It doesn't matter if it's in your living space, or a basement, attic, warehouse, garage, etc ... do you really want to spread blood, potential disease/tick/lice/etc everywhere?Ok, so here's our apples-to-apples comparison. 9-month experiment, testing 7 different products. We eradicated all the rats (11 total), and the oldest, simplest, cheapest trap is the clear winner:*Victor Old Fashioned Rat Trap- 7 (caught 7 of 11)* Tomcat Rat Snap - 1 (caught 1 of 11, but did NOT kill it)* D-Con Baitbits - Killed 3, but the bodies all ended up in a wall or floor, causing a HUGE stink and a HUGE mess to dig out. In one instance we had to remove part of a floor - took hours and cost hundreds of dollars. Given time, all the rodents may have eaten the bait, but the poison takes 3-10 days to take effect so it's hard to say. Poison has other problems - it gets spread around, it can be eaten by pets, or, a pet or wild animal might eat the dead/poisoned rodent. If you're going to use poison bait, we strongly recommend also using traps.*Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap- Zero (O). Left out for continuously for 9 months (270 days)*Tomcat Block Bait- Zero (0)* D-Con Rat Glue Traps - Zero (0) - This is an awful idea, just makes a mes. Avoid this!*Tomcat Wood Rat Trap- Zero (0), but the rat steals the bait every time. They do not snap. I whacked the trap with a broom handle and it still won't snap. Makes you wonder if the rat designed this one!Final note: If you need help placing your traps or learning about best baits, go to the Victor web site. Good information, quick & concise. My two cents on bait: any nut butter (peanut butter, etc) works great, mix in a small piece of bacon for good measure. However, if your rat came into your home/garage/building because they found a food source (like dog food, grain, etc), use that to bait your trap. Good luck!",1324684800,2011-12-24
5.0,"I'm not even sure where to start!  I've wanted to add a charcoal grill to my outdoor cooking fleet for many years just for those few times that I'd like to cook more naturally.  I've used this one 2 times so far and can't believe I've waited this long.  I think it's saved me over $1000 I was going to spend to replace my 10 yr old gas grill.This grill and a couple Weber accessories make charcoal grilling a breeze!  I haven't grilled with charcoal in years and obviously I had cheap junk for grills in the past.The quality of the grill is great, but I expected that.  I can see it lasting years and years as many others have attested to.  I'll easily use it even during the week when I don't have the time I thought it would take and thought gas was easier for.  The first use and trying to get used to charcoal again was almost a failure because I almost choked the heat down keeping the vents closed.  When I realized that the steaks slowed down cooking and the kettle top got wet from condensation it hit me that I had the vents closed thus the fire couldn't breath.  All I had to do was open the vents and 'viola, in no time the heat was back up and going strong with no other help from me, just air.Yesterday I outdid myself with ribs. Although I did cook them a little to high, they were the best I've ever done both falling off the bone and the best flavor I've ever gotten.  I was using Mesquite chips as well but I've done that on a gas grill and cooked twice as long and didn't get near the same results.  It's amazing how the kettle makes all the difference in the world keeping the charcoal hot and lasting a long time.  I'm amazed!Clean up is much easier than I expected.  The ash catcher is awesome, even in high gusty winds.  Access though the grill for adding fuel makes adding briquettes and wood a breeze.Assembly was easy and took less than 20 minutes taking my time.The only con I can come up with was that on the top handle, it came out of the undamaged box with a chip of the porcelain coming off as if it had been hit.  It's small and by the handle and not exposing the metal so it's not a functional problem but with the box arriving in perfect condition, it's obvious it happened before being packed.  However, I'd be surprised if anyone could find it.All I can say is that I'm sold!!  Everything Weber that I've bought, from the grill to the accessories, have been top notch. Charcoal grilling is now a breeze and so much better than gas.  The old saying is absolutely true; having the right tools make all the difference in the world.  The Weber Kettle is absolutely the right tool!!  Being made in the USA is the cherry on top!To address some of the complaints in the lesser ratings:The handles don't get hot.  As hot as mine has been, the handles are easy to hold with bare hands, although I tend to use a mitt around a grill.  The new handles should last in any weather condition and much longer than wood as well.It would be nice to have a temp gauge but that's not hard to add if you really need one.  I can see the benefit but it's limited.The Kettle is not unstable if it's put together right.  If it falls apart after assembling, the legs aren't being secured fully as they should be, which is to tap them all the way in.  Rolling it isn't a problem but like with most anything, you have to be careful.  Depending on which way you roll it, one might be able to knock it over if not careful, but I've not found that to be easy to do.  Standing, it's as stable as can be.  Again, if it's wobbly or falls apart as one has claimed, the legs were not assembled properly.The lid DOES have a hook to hang on the side of the kettle; it's on the underside of the top near the vent.  It hangs nicely on the side of the kettle.",1276387200,2010-06-13
5.0,Previously owned a 25' which proved as advertised for smaller projects around the garden.  It works as a standard garden hose but its ability to 'minimize' itself after use is priceless.  Purchased two for those extended locations away that are otherwise hard to reach.  The lime color reminds one that the hose need to put away after use.,1368057600,2013-05-09
4.0,"Bottom line: There's a lot to like about this chain saw with regard to build quality, features and performance. However, it is equaled on all these metrics by a good corded model for a lot less. The convenience of cordless may not be worth the extra cost.Full review: Like many homeowners with a suburban-sized yard, a gas-powered chainsaw is overkill. It comes in handy when you need it, but it's unlikely to see much use during the year. That complicates maintenance, since gas equipment does not like to sit idle unless it has been properly prepped to do so.The alternative has typically been a corded electric chainsaw. A good quality electric will give you much of the performance of a gas model without any of the gas engine maintenance issues. But, you're tied to an outlet or a generator.This chainsaw takes it a step further, and is the first cordless chainsaw that is a ""real"" chainsaw. Up until now, the cordless models have been limited use tools, such as the line made by Black and Decker. I have three different B&D; cordless chainsaws and they work well, but are limited to branch trimming. I think of them as pruners more so than chainsaws.The power this puts out is simply amazing, and equals that of my favorite electric chain saw, the WORX WG300 (WORX WG300 14-Inch 3 HP 14 Amp Electric Chain Saw).The saw includes a number of great design features to make it easier and safer to use. These include an automatic bar oiling system with an easy to see oil level window, a blade brake (an essential safety feature), metal dogs (spikes) at the base of the bar to reduce kickback, and a 16 inch bar that will give you the ability to tackle a pretty formidable tree. It is easy to adjust the chain tension, and it actually comes with a very good manual (a rarity these days). The 40v battery is massive compared with the 18v models I'm used to, and gives the saw ample power.The build quality seems excellent. This has a lot of heft, but it feels well-balanced. I didn't have any problems controlling the saw in use. You do notice the weight, but no more so than a good electric, and it is lighter than a similarly-sized gas machine.It includes a nice quality carry case that has an extension to fit the bar. It works well for keeping the saw clean while it is stored in the garage. The case fits just the saw (with or without a battery installed). It would have been nice if the case were a bit larger so the charger could fit in there as well.Blade speed was more than enough to make quick work of some 10 inch diameter logs. Again, a good gas powered saw, such as a Stihl, would leave this in the dust, but unless you're felling trees for a living, a bit slower blade speed is not a problem.The problem I had was the same as with any cordless device - run time. The manufacturer claims a charge will let you go through a cord of wood. I can't say if that is accurate, but I did start having run time problems once I had been using it for about 20 minutes. You can get through a lot of wood in 20 minutes with this, but the run time is not enough for me to get through what I need it to do on a single battery. As with any other cordless device, the solution is to have 2 batteries, so one is in the charger at all times. But that adds even more cost to an already pricy tool.The other issue I had was that it takes a second or so to come up to speed. Not a big issue, but enough to be noticeable. Lastly, while the handle is OK in terms of comfort, it does not excel in that area. It needs a rounder trigger handle, and the cross bar should have some non-slip padding on it for comfort and security. Collectively, these issues drop the rating to 4 stars.So, would I recommend this? Yes, but with the caveat that you can get the same performance and features in a corded electric at about a third of the price. While freedom from a cord is worth something, I'm not sure it's worth the premium price of this model. It is worth considering, however, due to its performance and ease of use.",1380067200,2013-09-25

4.0,"I have 5 raised garden beds and used the &#34;Yard Butler RC-3 Garden Cultivator&#34; to help me get them in shape for this summer's crops.This cultivator is light weight and will only be useful for fully established gardens. I had to pull the weeds that have grown over my beds since last autumn's harvest and the Yard Butler did a good job afterward in cultivating the soil.One thing I noticed was the small roots (from both the weeds and last year's vegetables) immediately got wound-up around the wheels. However, I was able to correct this by removing the middle wheel.The wheels, when all three were in place, rolled nicely forward, but tended to get stuck/bogged down on the return motion. Again, I corrected this by removing the middle wheel. Each wheel has a little screw-knob for fast and easy removal.At the end of the day, the Yard Butler did an acceptable job for a light-duty hand-powered tool.

3.0,"Not terribly offensive, and doesn't appear to harm anything I sprayed it on.  It's only been a few days though, so I can't really comment on that, nor on the efficacy of their proprietary SPOREX formulation.What I can say is that the pressure washer (thus, just plain water) does the lion's share of the work.  I call into question their claim that pre-soaking or pre-spraying isn't necessary.  Maybe not on materials you can just hammer-down on them with the pressure washer, but for wood, etc. the product didn't seem to do much more than plain high-pressure water.  Pre-soaking might have helped, but that doesn't abide the directions on the bottle.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences.At least it doesn't smell like Montana Solvent, and is certified to be greener than the stuff I've used in the past.  Some of the cleaners of olden days would about eat through your sneakers.  They would definitely kill vegetation whether you rinsed them down or not.  All in all, if I were doing another deck, coated in mildew and leaf stains, I think I would just cover my plants, dillute a little Clorox and cry 'Havoc'.This stuff seemed to be mostly about peace of mind, with not much cleaning.  My guess is there was moderate, incremental improvement in cleaning, but it wasn't astonishing.  I wish it were otherwise, but I can't endorse this product further than to say it might mildly improve your cleaning job, with the pressure washer still doing all the heavy lifting.",1401926400,2014-06-05

So I didn't use Deer Off over every garden on my priority, I thought we'd get a better sense of its effectiveness if I left some areas untouched.  The result, I've been watching a mother doe and her fawn visit my yard now for the past two weeks, however any ""munch damage"" has been confined to the control group beds that are in the back of the property.  The more ornamental flower beds in the front have survived unscathed.  And to underscore that effectiveness, those protected flower beds are heavily populated with hosta... a whitetail deer's most delightful treat in this neck of the woods.It would appear that this works so well that I can forgive the recalcitrant sprayer.",1343520000,2012-07-29
3.0,"This arrived decently packed and intact despite some delicate parts.  The feeder has a brass finish but is made out of very lightweight materials - it looks good from a distance but the lack of quality is apparent once you have it up close.We have VERY smart squirrels in our area - and they are quite territorial and eager to feast on the bird feeder seeds.  In fact, they feast on everything - from Halloween pumpkins to anything we try to put in the garden.  Nothing survives our plague of squirrels.I was skeptical of this feeder due to it having a plastic barrier.  The squirrels here chew through everything so plastic isn't going to stop them (as I found with my garden vegetables and various covers I used to protect the veggies).  So I know this isn't going to last very long as a bird feeder.  On the plus side, perhaps the seeds will keep the squirrels out of the vegetables (and not eat my son's halloween pumpkin before it even gets to be used for halloween).Interesting concept but needs a little more development.",1364515200,2013-03-29
5.0,"I have some really nice, heavy-duty hoses for washing the car, etc. Sometimes, though, it'd be nice to have a lighter hose for watering plants or something -- a hose that doesn't require a special storage rack & the effort of winding it back up when I'm done using it.For a while, I used one of those self-coiling plastic hoses (like the hose version of a slinky) but it always got coiled around itself and ended up being less convenient than just a normal hose, really.THIS hose, however, is awesome. It combines the durability of a heavy-duty hose with convenience and compactness.+ outer webbing provides superior protection from abrasion, and the elements+ rubber inner hose material is lightweight, but expands to full size+ compact and flexible when not in use+ built-in spigot means I don't even need a spray handle attachment with this hoseThe only 'downside' is -- this hose gives me a little less water output than a normal garden hose. It's plenty for watering the plants, but might be less than ideal for washing off the pool deck or rinsing off your car. Other than that, I think it's awesome.

4.0,"My upfront summary - a good mower that cuts my grass quite well, the grass catcher works okay but not perfectly, and the cord wasn't nearly as difficult to keep out of the way as I had expected.  If you have the ability to get a cord out to everywhere you want to cut grass, I think this is worth considering.  Larger lawns can also benefit if you want to avoid gas because you won't run out of juice when you have it plugged in versus running off of a battery.  It's not perfect, it's a little bulky compared to what I'm used to, and the handle height isn't adjustable (on mine, even though the pictures on Amazon show it is) - so if it doesn't fit you, you're out of luck.  If you're still interested :), I have more details below.Living in the desert, I have a smaller lawn that is about 600 square feet (around 20 by 30 feet).  So, definitely not a huge lawn.  Even so, I've put off buying a corded electric mower for years because I thought it would be a real hassle to deal with a power cord, and I thought the risk of slipping up and slicing the cord with the mowing blade were too high.  I always gravitated to wanting a battery-based model, but those have their own issues (heavier, can't mow if you forgot to charge the battery, batteries only last so long).  After growing up in Illinois and using a gas mower for many years, I just don't want one of those.  After reviewing the directions, I saw that B&D; had a diagram showing the recommended mowing pattern to make it easier to keep the cord out of the way - and it worked great for me!  Probably common sense, but I was so used to the way that I'd always mowed my lawn, it hadn't occurred to me to do it that way.  So, if you get one, check out the directions - it made using a cord a lot easier for me, and it alleviated a lot of the hassles that I had expected to encounter.There are a variety of mowers out there: gas, electric with cords, electric with batteries, and push reel.  I'd like to compare this to a push reel because for fourteen years, I've been using a reel mower much like thisAmerican Lawn Moweron Amazon.  Most reel mowers aren't fancy, but they can cost under $100, take up very little floor space, and work quite well if you don't let your grass get too long.  What mine doesn't do, but you can buy models that do, is catch the grass clippings.  What this B&D; brings to the table versus my reel mower is a much more even cut, it catches the grass, and it handles long (higher than 6"") grass with ease.  The end result is a cleaner looking lawn.  The drawbacks are it takes a lot more floor space in my garage, it's heavier and bulkier so it's more difficult to carry around to my lawn (I don't wheel it because the rest of my yard is rock), and it takes longer to get started because I have to get the cord all set up and in place.In the end, I really like the more consistent cut and reduced mowing effort from this B&D; versus my reel mower, but I might like even better the smaller footprint in my garage and reduced time it takes from start to finish with the reel mower.  So, for those of you with smaller lawns, I recommend that you at least consider a reel mower - but for those of you looking at corded mowers, I do recommend giving this model your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.Pros:(*) It's a Black & Decker.  I've purchased a number of their electric lawn care items (blower/vac, pole saw, chain saw), and I've overall been happy with the build quality of them.  This mower is no exception(*) Handles long (at least six inches) grass with no problems(*) Very even and consistent cut(*) Super easy (and I mean super) change between cutting lengths.  I can't get over just how effortless it is to move the lever and adjust it.  I love it(*) Decently quiet.  Kind of like a hair dryer.  Louder than my reel mower, but by no means painfully or annoyingly loud(*) Safety bar on the handle will turn on blade if you let go of the handle(*) Fairly lightweight for a mower, given the extensive use of plastics(*) Has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle to store your extension cord right on the mower.  If you have a spare cord to use just with this mower, that is a very handy feature(*) Won't run out of power because it's cordedCons:(*) The vent holes all around the grass box let a lot of dust and dry clippings out.  The box does catch most of the grass, but it spits out a good deal of small particles(*) The handle on mine only had one set of holes, so the height is not adjustable.  It fits my height (5'9"") okay, but I'd like to be able to adjust it lower.  If you're shorter than me, this might be a problem(*) Takes up a lot more floor space in the garage than my upright reel mower, so finding a place for it was more difficult.  Not a con if you've got plenty of room or are replacing another similarly-sized mower(*) It's always attached to a power cord.  Yep, that's both a pro and a con :)Notes:(*) It comes mostly assembled, which is nice, but getting it all together might take a little patience.  Putting the grass box together was a real pain for me.  The dark plastic halves aren't overly rigid, but you need to get a number of tabs lined up and snapped into place - which isn't easy when the halves are flexing and moving the tabs out of alignment.  One of my tabs was out of alignment, but I eventually got it massaged into place using a screwdriver.  It took much longer than I had expected.  Once done, though, it's easy to insert and remove the grass box from the main mower.  Also, one of the screws to get the handle attached took some doing to get it to catch the threads on the recessed hole",1402185600,2014-06-08

3.0,"I got the Garden Genius and yes it is a nice product and reusable and works as beautifully as advertised.  The main benefit to these versus simply using gravel is the weight of the pots after planting.  Compared to a couple inches of gravel, this does significantly lighten the pot which may be important to many people.  It's not a big deal to me so the price/benefit ratio isn't that high for this, thus the 3 stars because I can't believe this product is that expensive to produce, being that this is an offshoot of an industrial product.  But if weight is a consideration, then by all means load the pot with this and a fine potting soil and you'll be a happy camper.",1311206400,2011-07-21

3.0,"This strong ducting fan arrived with one of the screws anchoring the fan to the metal strip at the base having fallen off, so I had to screw it back in place so the fan wouldn't be loose and hitting the sides of the cylinder. After that I just plugged it in to an electrical outlet with its grounded plug and it was running smoothly. If you have this fan you will probably want an extension cord unless your outlet is very close to where the fan will be - and some type of switch for the power outlet since this fan has no power switch. This is a pretty simple, basic fan, ideal for air ducts or small areas where air needs to be blown and circulated. You may want to cover the end of it so that nothing accidentally goes into the spinning metal blade. Overall this fan is OK, seems like it will be durable, and is valuable for specific uses. It could have had more frills considering the price point, so I'm giving it just 3 stars.",1385683200,2013-11-29

5.0,"I am writing this review for Amazon, they sent this to me for free so I can try it out and let you know the deal.I like this, I was just about to fill a square planter to plant some veggies for my deck.  I was going to have problems going out in my yard to find so much soil to fill it with, then I was wondering how to move it so it is in the sun for most of the day.  This pillow is light as a feather it can be washed very easily to use for next year, the surface is smooth and I do not think too many roots will be able to penetrate the covering.  It is a bit flexible so if you pot is a bit smaller it can accommodate that.  It will easily filter the water so it does not carry the soil out with it.  I did put a layer of newspaper on top of it so it wouldn't get too dirty and I will not have to clean it so much.  Just in case.This is a solid product,  I wish it were cheaper but you really cannot go wrong with this price since it is reusable, how many times? only time will tell.  I am a bit frugal but I really like this one and I would buy several so I could conserve on my soil.  I like large pots but refrain from buying them since I have to fill with so much soil, oh I have plenty of dirt I have a big plot but who wants to lug it up to my deck. Since it is very thick it will really make a big difference in the weight.It's a buy for me.",1309478400,2011-07-01

5.0,We live in newer housing development that doesn't have fencing so the rabbits can easily so wherever they want. We have several fruit trees that seem to attract the rabbits and they leave their beans all over the place. They also like to bite at the bottom of the tree for some reason. I like rabbits but I wish they wouldn't leave their beans in the yard because one of our goofy dogs will try to eat it. That being said I like having a way to keep the rabbits away without harming them in any way. I can't say how this product works to repel deer or squirrels but it works very well at keeping the rabbits away. I have used this product before but it come in a large bottle with a battery operated spray nozzle. The nozzle was a total pain because it didn't want to start spraying and kept getting clogged because the repellent is slightly thick. This bottle is concentrated so you don't need to use very much at all. I used it to build a barrier around my fruit trees and a barrier around the outline of my yard. I just fill up the applicator cup and walk along pouring a very thin line of the repellent. It doesn't last super long but I would say it normally lasts 4 to 6 weeks with no signs of any rabbits.,1375056000,2013-07-29

This is great for sitting in a windowsill, but it does not convert to sitting on the kitchen sink over the faucet.It is cute, and I will be using it - just not in my kitchen as I had hoped.

4.0,"I've gone through a few power washers.  I don't use them often, so I don't get new ones to replace a broken one, just usually I see one and it has a feature I'd like, so I give my old one to a friend or family member, and get the new one.This one looked interesting when it came up in the Vine program, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was winter time when I ordered it, and living in Wisconsin with the winter we've had, I've got so much salt in the garage that I've never seen it look like this before.  In about a 2 foot oval around the entire area the car sits, it's like a small white beach, there are literally small salt dunes in many places.This was probably the biggest pain of any I have purchased to unbox and put together.  There are 19 pieces you pull out, 21 if you count the two wheel covers that were slipped on the wheels but not fully in place yet, and had to be removed to put the wheels on anyway.  Some things didn't line up very easily and required a bit of force to get them into place, and this was mostly due to the barrels the screws went through not going into the holes set in the receiving piece without a bunch of elbow grease and slightly bending things to align them.  There's a little design quality there they could improve upon.I don't like that the connector for the hose is all plastic.  Plastic for the screw threads, plastic for the little rollers that pop out to secure it to the nozzle on the power washer, just plastic plastic plastic.  I've had far too many of these break in the past from other manufacturers. I also don't like the wand's connector.  The hose from the washer to the wand actually slides up inside a deep recessed hole with a cover totally shrouding it.  The hose has to line up a specific way, because of the shape of the plug on it, and there is no marking on the hose to show &#34;line up with this spot&#34; on the wand.  So you have to look into the &#34;tunnel&#34; on the hose to the hole inside, see where the parts are supposed to be lined up, then get the hose oriented this way, and then push it up inside while maintaining that orientation.  Slightly cocking it to one side or the other will mean you won't get it inserted.  So there's some give and take there.  Most places just use round retaining flanges that can be inserted regardless, but this one is rectangular, so it HAS to go in the right way.I was able to do a good stress test of the unit for my first run though, cleaning out that aforementioned garage full of salt and gunk from the winter roads here.  Since we've had an insanely brutal winter compared to normal for the last couple decades, between more snow and more days below zero, we've used a LOT of salt on our roads.  Now that we're in April, and I finally saw a day break 50 degrees, I thought I would finally clean my garage.  Since I didn't even have hoses outside yet, and the faucets outside are still turned off, I bought a short 15 foot hose to run from my wash tub in the laundry room off my garage to the power washer, and just snaked the hose through the garage door and left it open.Once I got past the reset safety on the plug, I saw that it had apparently been shipped in the &#34;on&#34; position.  It's a large 3&#34; or so circle on the BOTTOM of the front of the washer that rotates to turn this on and off.  I like the large oversized swtich, I just don't like the position.  So I got it going, and spent some time working on the concrete floor in my garage.It performed very well, as good as any power washer I've had in the past, and actually better than most.  On/Off with the wand's handle was quick and flawless.  I know my stationary tub does not put out as much water as quickly when compared to the hose bibs outside.  I've had other power washers when, using something with less than &#34;full water&#34; flow like I was using today, would kind of squirt out a little water until you released the handle on the wand, pulled it, released it, and pulled it again, getting enough water pressure to the pump again, and finally the pump would kick in again and it would start actually using power.  I've had that happen here previously using this very stationary tub.  But it never happened once with this unit.  Full power the entire time despite the lesser inflow of water to the unit.Noise levels were about on par with any power washer I've ever owned.  The hose straightened out easily when I &#34;unscrewed&#34; it by twisting the wand to get rid of all the spirals in it from being rolled up, it didn't try to hold it's old &#34;wound&#34; position like many do.  The hose seems to be better than most of the really bad plastic feeling hoses the other washers I've had used.The wand twists to give you control over the size of the spray, and there's a setting for using the detergent mixer as well.  That was another piece of this that just disappointed me as far as the poor engineering.  The instructions show clearly that you are supposed to run the line from the top back of the power washer to the detergent container underneath the handle where this snaps in.  But if you do that, it would kink the unit.  going to the side wasn't a good option either.  I ended up pulling the little line apart and feeding it through one of the other cutouts in the handle, since that way it wasn't compressed and didn't interfere with getting the container on and off.  I've posted a couple pictures of what I'm talking about so you can see what I mean.I also miss the wind up crank my other one had, since there was a hose reel built into the top of it.  But ultimately I prefer this one since as I said, the hose doesn't seem to be forcing itself to stay in a coiled up spiral shape, I can actually get this completely straight and flat while I'm using it.  I find that far more useful than an easy way to roll it up when I'm done.The AC cord has plenty of length, and the hose is a usable length as well.All told, this is a good little unit.  Engineering issues would've made me give this just 3 stars most likely if it performed as adequately as the other power washers I've used in the past, but I had to give it another star for how well it actually worked.  It had no problems stripping the gunk off my concrete floor, or the Weathertech floor mats of my Jeep, or even the floor mats I dragged outside to hose down now that the winter season has mostly passed us up.  If it weren't for how the hose has to line up just the right way without being able to visually see it while you do it for the connector to the wand, or the assembly issues with things not lining up right before you screwed them in, the performance would've earned this 5 stars.  So it balances out to 4, and it's certainly earned all of them.",1397260800,2014-04-12

4.0,"I love small grills.  I have, over the years, owned quite a few of them.  First I had aWeber Smokey Joe,then aWeber Q 100,which I replaced with aWeber Q 200when somebody decided that they were more worthy of my Q100 than I was. Recently I purchased a Napoleon infrared portable grill and I am pretty happy with it even though it cooks REALLY hot.  When I got a chance to try out the Char-Broil TRU Infrared I thought that I would give it a shot since I can never have too many little grills.  In the end I am glad that I did.Comparing the Char-Broil to my other grills is a little complicated as each has their own niche.  The Grill2Go cooks a lot more like the charcoal powered Smokey Joe.  The heat radiates from the central diffuser rather than from a ring of burners like the Weber Q grills.  The Char-Broil is, by far, the most rugged and portable of all the grills that I have owned.  There are two latches that keep the grill safely locked when transporting it. The finish is also very tough and less likely to be marred than the stainless steel Napoleon.I am a little confused with this grills description as ""Tru Infrared.""  While I understand that the heat radiates from the diffuser plate rather than from heated air, as with the Weber Baby Q series, it is nothing like the Napoleon which uses a ceramic block to cook the food.  The Napoleon is much more like what I think of as an infrared grill.  It sears a steak in seconds and heats up much hotter than the Char-Broil.  However, the Char-Broil cooks much more like a conventional grill, making it easier for me to use.  I like that it has a thermometer on the lid and although I question it's accuracy it's still helpful.  This is a great little grill for tailgating and picnics.  For the price I think that it can't be beat.UPDATE 06/11/2013  I wanted a cover for my grill and could not find one made for it by Char-Broil so I purchased aWeber Vinyl Cover for Q-100and it fits perfectly.  I also attached the grill to a 20 lb. tank using the sameAdapter Hosethat I used with my Weber Q-200 and it fits like it was made for it.",1368489600,2013-05-14

I initially had problems where it would collapse as I was using it. It turns out that you need to turn the handle until you hear a soft click. Once it clicks, the handle stays in place.Configuring the blades was also very easy. Each blade is screwed into place with a bolt that&#8217;s large enough so that it&#8217;s easy to turn.

Specifically, there is no sharp edge or sharp corner that could be scratch your skin. The holes on the top and bottom are on the smaller size too.Due to the small size, it won't hold big amount of wood chips.

I believe the intent is to make sure the cover does not open if you throw it into the charcol. For my big smoker box, I have to carefully lay it down in the grill to keep the cover close.While trying to refill wood chips during cooking, I put the box in water to cool it down first and then open it safely. This extra step does not add too much hassle, as the bucket for soaking wood chips is usually nearby.I wouldn't recommend to put smoker box (any smoker box) right on top of the charcoal, as the wood chips will burn out too fast and don't have sufficient time to smoke the food and you will be busy in refilling wood chips.All in all, a well made nice little smoker box.",1271030400,2010-04-12

1.0,"The .7Kg / 25 oz Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac, designed and engineered in Germany and made in Hungary, is packaged as four pieces which quickly snap together.

On relatively clean mirrors in the bathroom the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac worked well enough.  When I tried this approach on dirty exterior windows and wound up with a streaky mess.  I went to the product website for additional information and found the online instructions require a three step process.

2.0,"I have reviewed several different Deer Repellent products in the past 2 years and am still hopeful that either something new that works will come out or a new formula of an old standby will do the trick.The market is still prime for a great product to emerge.....The putrescent egg and hot pepper combo is not working. I think the local southeastern deer are starting to like hot & rotten.There are a couple of other details that make this product loose a couple of stars besides the fact that it does repel all deer:- The advertising that you can use it on organic gardens but not anywhere near food crops is misleading.- The price at $38 for 32 oz is slightly over $1.18 an oz and 32 oz only makes 2 gallons of repellent. This is suppose to treat 400 ornamental plants 4 feet tall or 4000 sq ft of plantings. But spraying top and bottom of leaves as per directions really gives much less than 400 plants. These would have to be very small . I estimate that with my professional backpack sprayer with constant pressure tip installed and on a very fine mist spray pattern that I would only be able to spray approx 100 ornamental 4 ft tall plants.

5.0,"First of all, these really are big, handsome planters. A five-gallon bucket fits neatly inside the smallest one with the top edge even with the planter's lip, and that planter fits inside the bigger one. This opens up a lot of possibilities for the inventive gardeners among us who swear by those free pickle buckets.The planters are more like cache pots, without drainage holes. You could drill holes, but it would be better to use an interior pot (like the black ones that your plants come in at the nursery) set on top of some stones or gravel. I filled them both up with water to see if they will hold the water. Yes. These won't leak all over your deck or inside the house; you just need to be sure whatever pot you use on the inside has suitable drainage.I'm thinking one or both of these planters could be used to construct a beautiful water feature using an aquarium pump--although I wouldn't take chances by not reinforcing the inside with pond liner material. The planters have a wide lip that makes them look very thick, even though they are not, and would look very appealing with water flowing over the edge.Yes, they are lovely to look at, and they are well priced compared to what one has to pay at a gardening center for larger planters. They aren't much heavier than the faux concrete pots of the same size. Based on the material they are made from, I don't know how hot they would get in a sunny location and don't have a sunny spot myself to test them in. Depending on what part of the country you live in, heat building up in the metal could be either a good thing or a bad thing. Being a darker grey color, I would expect they would absorb and hold heat.Very nice. Even a person who does not garden at all could use them as classy executive wastepaper or magazine baskets!",1237939200,2009-03-25
4.0,"I've put it through one season here in Colorado and it is doing well.  Pushes fairly easily and does a decent job.  It does leave some whiskers here and there and won't cut tough weeds, dandelions, crabgrass, etc.  Let's be honest, it doesn't cut quite as thoroughly as a traditional mower. But feels good to not have to buy gas for it and to be able to mow my lawn at any time of the day without annoying my neighbors or mowing my lawn at the same time toddlers are running around in the yard.  I haven't figured yet how I am going to sharpen the blades.  I know it says they don't need to be sharpened but I'm sure they will. Seems like it will be a little involved with the rotary blades.  So it has a few quirks but it knocks the grass down and I like some of the other advantages over traditional gas powered mowers.",1353715200,2012-11-24

5.0,"I consider myself to be a macho guy, or at least having a sensible amount of bravery, but I think we get exposed too much already, to a bunch of stuff that isn't good for us. The way I look at it, whatever kills, kills. Therefore I am always looking for a benign method of getting rid of pests. I noticed that some of the ant products have boric acid in them, and then I came across a homemade cure on Facebook.Boric Acid Powder 4 OZ.mixed with peanut butter, or jelly is ideal because the ants ingest it, and bring it back to the nest, and feed the queen. That way it takes out the whole nest instead of just getting a few. There are different types of ants; some like sweets, and others like proteins, so peanut butter, or jelly covers them both. You can Google this homemade recipe by typing in, ""Boric acid and sugar to kill ants"". I have seen Boric acid used, or claim to be used for an eye wash or personal hygiene for women. READ the label on the container whereas I am not an expert on boric acid. I like what one article said, ""Even too much water can be toxic."" :-)So anyhow I use the boric acid and sugar mix when I want to get rid of those kinds of ants in the house. Fortunately I don't have cock roaches etc. at least so far I haven't had a problem with them. On the outside of the house I like to use a spray as long as I am not spraying down areas that have run off into a gardening area where I grow vegetables. So a good home insect killer in a handy spray such as the Terro T3400 is great for outdoors, and the boric acid combo is great for indoors.I would like to say that I used the TERRO and say ants and other insects high tailing it out of there, but I can't really say that. This is later in the season, and not when ants go nuts and seem to be everywhere. So now is not the best time for me to give you immediate results. The thing I like about TERRO is how long lasting it is.I saw rows of the very tiny ants making their way from a window sill down an outside wall and into the ground. They were on the march. That too was early in the season. I am saying that because they need some contact with the ground. So spraying along your homes base edge is going to be effective in holding them from entering the house in the first place.There are a lot of reviews here about direct results. I just wanted to share with you what I have found to be a good solution, and a way of not having to ingest toxic substances into your system. Hope this helps.",1376179200,2013-08-11

You simply run water over it from a faucet, or dip it, for 1 second, and it gives you a range of softness by the color on the strip matched with the color guide on the bottle. It is fast and easy. Tests have been repeated with it and it seems accurate as I have a softened tap and unsoftened tap. Be aware that a softener does not make water salty. The salt is only used to back-flush the beads that accumulate calcium from taking the hardness (calcium) out of the water that collects on the beads. A softener will not remove iron. You should place a filter, and iron remover if needed, before the water gets to the softener so it does not accumulate iron, dirt, or sediment.

5.0,"Received this as tree pruner as a Christmas gift and have used regularly over the past nine months, so feel that I know this tool very well now.We have about one acre of land in a subdivision, and two-thirds of that area is wooded (and a creek runs down through the woods). The wood line is full of old hardwood trees, new volunteers and tons of shrubbery -- so there's always a hefty amount of maintenance to be done.The first thing we did when Spring rolled around was to break out this tool and trim many of the low-hanging limbs to a level that would allow me to safely mow along the tree line again. Our 14 year old son was helping, and our first impression was WOW! the pruning saw blade is very, very sharp and easy to use. Without that saw our job would have taken weeks instead of a couple days!At the same time we noticed something that other reviewers have knocked this pruner for -- the telescoping handle tended to slip from time to time, always at the most inopportune time (like when the blade was 12 feet up in mid-slice of a limb). However, this was an easy problem for us to solve... we just trekked back to the tool box and found the right size socket wrench, then tightened the two bolts on the locking mechanism until the slipping stopped. Tightening involved a bit of trial & error work, we tightened them too much at the onset but got the tension just right within a couple of minutes.Sawing limbs with this thing is a fast and easy job; just make sure that you are sawing on as much of a horizontal plane as you can and it will go right on through like cutting butter. Do not recommend sawing with the blade in a vertical position, like when standing just under the limb, as this makes it both difficult and dangerous for you.Cutting smaller limbs with the pruner was just as easy too, and the leverage provided by rope & pulley system is amazing. Very little effort is needed as long as you have the limb properly perpendicularly lined up and as long as the limb is not too large for the shear.Had not problem with the nylon rope; yes, it has some stretch but the handle is made to slide along the rope and can be set wherever you need it to take up any slack. Good design and easy to use.Bottom line: One of nicest yard work related gifts I have received and it gets a lot of use. Recommended  if you are looking for a tree pruner like this one and have the patience to make a couple tweaks to it along the way.",1378598400,2013-09-08
3.0,"I have yet to find the perfect hummingbird feeder, and I've gone through a lot.  This feeder is no exception.While it holds a lot of nectar and has six ports, I find that hummingbirds are too territorial to allow more than one family to feed -- one male, one female, and, eventually, a couple of juveniles.  The huge capacity of nectar is wasted since it must be changed twice a week to avoid bacteria and mold.At first, I absolutely loved that it didn't leak while hanging in its place -- and then I had to change the nectar.  The moment I moved the feeder, nectar poured out of the spouts and over my hands.  It was even messier when I turned it upside down to unlock the base.  I was covered with sugar water. I'm sure the ants had a field day below.The feeder comes unassembled, with no instructions.  It was pretty easy to figure out, although if the flowers aren't all the way in, the feeder will leak right away.  Everything is plastic.

Just a few days before we applied this a group of 4 deer were munching away on a tree we had just planted.  Our flowers are often grazed on also, particularly our lilacs.What impressed me right off the bat was the sprayer, first off the batteries were installed so we could go right to work and second it comes with a holster on the container.  The sprayer works great, you can adjust the spray and it sprays about two feet.The product does seem to work.  The plants and trees this was sprayed on have been fine for about a week.  There is really no concrete way to know for sure, we have gone weeks with no problems with no product used and then have had deer using our yard as a person feeding station.While I realize this is an expensive product I do not think you have to do more than a spray or two on foliage for it to work and given what a four or five foot tree costs and how depressing it is to find it stripped for leaves, not to mention flowers, it is worth it.",1339200000,2012-06-09
4.0,"Had this for over a year now. Bought it to connect my Cuisinart CGG-200 to Blue Rhino Propane tank. On a full tank, this hose works great. Recently, the pressure seems to have dropped resulting in weak flames. Since it was working previously, I didn't suspect the hose and thought it was my tank. (but switching tank didn't help). I thought it was the grill inlet or burner being blocked but both appeared to be fine too after inspection.I deduced something could be blocking in the hose. Air/water/whatever? I never did figure that out but my only option was to find a way to clear the hose passageway. I turned on the grill and let it burn (irregular and weak flames). While burning, I turned off the propane tank and let the grill burn up the remaining gas in the hose until the flame died. I then turn on the propane tank and let it fill up the hose again and repeatedly ignite the burner. This approach works! So was it a lousy hose or was it due to elements caused by the varying weather since my grill is out in the yard 24x7? Anyhow, clearing the hose appears to solve the problem for me multiple times.If the hose is still working, why then did I rate it as 3-star? It's because I don't think a propane hose should require any maintenance at all. Just like a garden hose, it should behave as expected and not require workaround. I'm planning to get a different brand hose and see if such problem persist. If it doesn't, this rating should drop to 2-star.***9/28/2013***Hose still working good despite the intermittent weak flames issue. It appears my 'clear the hose' method resolved the issue consistently each time it occurs. I'm deducing it is the combination of changing weather (my grill is outdoor all the time) and long period of non-usage that caused the issue. In all fairness, since the hose is operating fine for more than 2 years now, I'm bumping the rating from 3 to 4 stars.",1356912000,2012-12-31
5.0,"This is the third Terro product we've tried this year.  The first,Terro 300 Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Killer II Baits, 6-Pack, proved successful in enticing carpenter ants to eat its tasty poison. You can see inside the 6-pack bait, and can tell instantly if the ants have been eating it. All 6 of ours were emptied within a day or two of the ants discovering its goodness.  So, we orderedTerro 1800 3-Ounce Outdoor Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Baits, 3-Packand were a bit dismayed that we couldn't see inside; however, we're confident our carpenter ants like it too.  But, every day, my hubby would say, ""I don't like all these carpenter ants coming into the garage.""  So we ordered Terro ant-killer in powder form. It works a bit differently than the liquid baits. The powder bait kills on contact, is waterproof and lasts for 8 months. Once the ants know how bad it is, they stay away from it. We have no more carpenter ants coming into the garage. We then put it around our home's foundation, and sprinkled some onto/into our railroad ties that the ants had taken up residence in...well, at least that's how it looked to us.

4.0,"I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with this at first but it&#8217;s one of those products that just grows on you. It&#8217;s made from galvanized steel tube bent into shape and welded with end caps to clean up the holes and mounts with two screws.I was disappointed because the finish was not that great. The photo shows one that is pretty much polished metal while the actual thing does not look polished at all and has some kind of material identification number markings pressed into the metal in a couple of spots.  It also didn&#8217;t come with any hardware. So you have to source your own screws/bolts or whatever you plan to use.That aside, I did hang this up on our redwood fence. We had some suitable screws with largish size heads that fit the two holes. Our fence was screwed rather than nailed so it was no problem to screw this in. It only took a couple of minutes and the long double stem that has been welded provides a lot of support as well as being wide enough that the hanger does not rotate from side to side.The 50 inch hose hung well and the curvy shape of the hanger and the fact that it&#8217;s at an angle means that it&#8217;s easy to take the hose off without the hose getting caught or tangled.ConclusionDespite the finish being a bit industrial looking up close, it is a sturdy piece that matches our galvanized fence posts. So in my case it doesn&#8217;t look at all out of place. Plus you can&#8217;t really see the blemishes unless you&#8217;re looking for them.

And while theVictor M265 Kill & Seal Mouse Trapsdid a commendable job, I decided I wasn't going to mess around anymore.After reading the reviews here, I decided to skip the bundled no-name batteries and go with some decent alkalines, and since my mice seem to enjoy peanut butter, I put tiny little bits on the steps. Another dab of peanut butter inside (JIF creamy seems to be irresistible) was all I needed before flipping the switch.Because I didn't really know the scope of my mouse problem, I opted to put the Multi-Kill in a relatively open space near one of the corners in the garage. It was good enough to lure two in to the Kill & Seal traps, so I thought I'd give it a try before moving boxes that mice may have turned in to condos.The next morning, my trap was blinking like a Ghostbusters trap. The zapping area? Clean as a whistle... except for that peanut butter. The mouse's last meal is definitely not a filling one. In the bucket, it looked like two fluffy mice decided to take a nap. Even the bucket was free of droppings or liquid. In fact, it was almost unnerving how peaceful it seemed. This probably won't satiate you, if you want some sort of mouse vengeance kill-dozer.The only thing I really have on my wishlist for this item, is for the bucket to pop out with a bit less force. It takes a fair amount of effort, and I have a feeling that when it's closer to the capacity of 10 mice, their fluffy little corpses could go flying if you're not careful.

The feeder was ""packed"" with three small air-filled cushions in a huge box so it rolled around freely and experienced every shock that is the normal part of shipping. I thought about just sending it back and not doing a review until it was replaced, but I decided that the best way to support fellow Amazon customers is to give a realistic impression of both the product and how likely it is to arrive in a hassle-free, undamaged manner.So, here are the facts: The feeder was packed without consideration for how it might be handled in transit. The cover over the feeder's ports was cracked - most probably from poor packing and / or poor quality construction. The barrel that holds the seed was glued poorly to the heavy metal, spring-loaded base - I counted only 2 spots where there seemed to be evidence of plastic cement, barely covering 30 to 40% of the contact surface. When I thought I could re-glue the pieces together, I discovered that the parts didn't seat together well enough to do that. (Actually the parts didn't seat together at all.)My wife, ever the optimist, said, ""it makes me wonder how long this thing would have held up if it was getting banged around by a determined squirrel (are there any other kinds?). The kind of question I suppose you are asking yourself now...Bottom line - poor packaging, shoddy construction, broken on arrival.Not recommended.",1377475200,2013-08-26

4.0,"This device is designed to provide you plants with consistent water over a couple weeks, like when you go on vacation. Now the water reservoir is rather cheaply made. The lid does not close properly, I had to place a rock on it to keep it closed. Now if you look above, you can get the Hydrospikes by themselves and use almost any bottle or jug with them. This model works best when you don't have any place for that jug as it attaches to the side of the flower pot. You can also use multiple hydrospikes to one jug to water multiple plants or one large pot.Now the one thing to keep in mind is that you do need to ""prime the pump"" by soaking the terracotta sensor and pouring water into the hydrospike to get the water flowing. You may also need to do this occasionally if the water stops or runs out for any reason.If you have a lot of flower pots, are forgetful when it comes to watering and especially if you have a tendency to over water your plants, then this is a great tool for keeping your plants healthy and alive.",1342310400,2012-07-15

5.0,"This is my favorite of all my electric hedge trimmers.  I have had several in the past - 2 cordless, and 2 with cords.  I strongly favor the cordless since I have a tendency to cut into the cords.Here's what I really like about the Toro 51496 Cordless Hedge Trimmer:1.  It's light in weight.  I am female and can easily lift, carry and use this trimmer even over my head.2.  It cuts nicely.  It cut down our overgrown hedges like a hot knife through butter.  Even cut stems that were up to 1/4 inch in diameter.3.  The safety switch that must be constantly held is very easy on the thumb.  On my other cordless, I had to push the safety switch which really tired my entire hand.  On this hedge trimmer, the safety switch is PULLED back which really saves wear and tear on your thumb.4.  The battery only took about an hour to charge.  I don't yet know how long it will hold a charge but I did get 4 BIG bushes trimmed down to size before it started raining.5.  It has a swivel mechanism.  With the push of a button the cutting apparatus will swivel so that you don't necessarily have to turn the entire hedge trimmer on it's side to cut down the side of a bush or shrub.  I still have to get used to that feature, but I think it's a good one.There's really nothing I can find to complain about concerning this hedge trimmer.  It cuts well, is easy to use, and charges quickly.  Nice little machine!UPDATE:  April 29, 2012I took the Toro 51496 Cordless Hedge Trimmer over to my mother's house and cut back all of her bushes and hedges.  I really like the swivel feature because by pressing the blue button, the motor and cutting blade will rotate together either to the left or right 90 degrees and lock in. I was able to cut the sides of the bushes while still holding the handle of the trimmer in the upright position.  It really made cutting the sides of the bushes and hedges much easier.",1335484800,2012-04-27
5.0,"I bought this last year to use with my new pool. So in about six months of using it, here are my initial thoughts:PROS- Very comfortable- Lets water come up through the float so you actually feel like your IN the pool, not ON the pool (my pool temp is usually 82-85 so this is favorable)- Easy to pack up to carry or store- Colors have not faded even with salt water and sunCONS- Could be challenging to get in if you're, uhm, voluptuous- You can't lay on your stomach, only on your backOVERALLThis is an excellent float to have for a pool.

3.0,"My initial reaction was that this is a wonderful concept, and it is.  Everything you need for a vegetable/herb garden in one place.  Just peel back the seal on the pod and pop it into a pot.  Easy.  There is a nice variety of pods--romaine, lettuce, dill, cilantro, basil, tomato, bean, spinach, cucumber, etc. It is very well-packaged.  In fact, the packaging seems to have received more attention than the actual product.A close look indicates that each pod will have at least two seeds?  Really? That means that I will, most likely, harvest nothing from most of these pods.  Having gardened from seeds in the past, I know that not all seeds will grow to maturity.Additionally, most people who are interested in seed pods have limited space and/or time.  This brings me to the realization that those people do not have space for 18 pods nor do they have the time to cultivate them. You must actually plant the pods.  If you wanted to start them in a flat container before planting, you won't be able to as they are not flat-bottomed.I will update my review once I see what does and what does not sprout or grow to maturity.  It will be annoying to have gathered enough pots to plant these 18 pods if there is not a good success rate.UPDATE: The cherry tomato pod produced two plants and is growing nicely. Nothing from the spinach.  One dill pod is growing and one produced nothing.  The basil did not grow well--what I planted on my own from seed is flourishing but the pods were not successful.  The cucumber produced one plant.  The bean (one of the easiest plants to grow) did not produce anything.  The lettuce pods did very well.  Cilantro produced one plant that is doing ""OK"".  Not much was actually harvested from these plants. Seeing results, I think that my initial rating of 3 stars is appropriate, if not, the rating would be a bit lower.",1369526400,2013-05-26

5.0,"This is a much better trimmer than the other 4 I've owned and I highly recommend it for light trimming.Some will be inclined to call me a nut because this is my fourth B&D; Electric String Trimmer with one exception.  This one is battery operated while the others were operated by 100 feet of extension cord.  Years ago, I bought my first electric trimmer and was pleased with its operation until it burned up in less than a year and the selling company refused to honor its warranty because I did not have the original receipt.  My fault.  I threw it away and have not bought one item from that company since.  I replaced it with my first B&D; electric trimmer and away I went.  I had to increase the length of cord and now I have over 200' of cord to work it.  And it worked fine for a few months and it broke.  B&D; took it back with no problem.  Another one went south and they replaced it.  Each broken trimmer took place within the first year of ownership so my cost was zero except for the handling and packing trash that goes with such a return.  The last corded trimmer still works O.K. but the string device will Not move the string when it is time.  I have to undo the string container and feed it manually.  That doubles my trimming time and is quite a hassle especially during summer.  Incidentally, I have a super gas powered trimmer that I use for the distant sections of the yard and for heavier material.  It is much more powerful and used on special occasions such as when the deer and other critters stop eating the brush.Sorry for the history but I come to this trimmer with a modicum of experience and patience.  This trimmer supports such things as not having to lug that heavy orange cord all around yards of yard.  P.S. I have yet to cut the cord with the trimmer.  I can't believe it either.  The box arrived in one working piece.  A few cuts to tape and actually reading some of the instructions, plugging in the charger and attaching a battery it was a wait until the next day and away we trimmed; with ease.  I ran the battery down in about 30 minutes of trimming and not counting the walking to time.  The next day after the other battery had charged I finished the yard with a little of the juice remaining.  I think ""juice"" is slang for battery power.  The length adjustment is perhaps one of the best features.  One of us is 6'3"" and the other is 5'5"".  One size does not fit all so having the ability to increase or decrease the length is quite nice.  When it is trimming, not cutting, time a simple twist of the shaft permits a straight line of cutting and it sure looks nice when it's fresh.  I felt so good about the trimmer that I even chunked the box in case it did not work.  It works and works well.",1278374400,2010-07-06
4.0,"This hand lopper came to me along with theFiskars 9843 Quantum Hand Pruner, and the two products share the same attributes, especially when compared to the standard versions of those products made by Fiskars.I confess that I am a big fan of Fiskars hand tools. TheirFiskars 7936 PowerGear Prunerhas served me well for several years, and last year, I picked up theFiskars 9668 Long Handle Digging ShovelandFiskars 9654 Transplanting Spadeabout a year ago, and they have proven to be indestructible.I also have theFiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper, which is the plain-looking sibling to this Quantum Hand Lopper. Having both, it's easy to make comparisons between the two and to provide some insight as to whether the large difference in price is worthwhile for you.As with its hand-pruner cousin, this cork-handled silver lopper is a beauty to look at. Unfortunately, that seems to be the only differentiating factors when it comes to using it. The description says that it's made from ""premium European steel,"" but I'm not sure how much of a benefit that really is. While using it for a couple of hours clearing fallen branches from a wooded path, it worked the same as the black-handled lopper I've had for a few years (which is a testament to that model's durability).The cork handles have the potential of being easier on the hands, but they also have the potential of flaking off from use/damage. I wear work gloves when doing landscape work, so I prefer the rubberized handles of the 9154. The cheaper model also has more bright orange (the entire handles), which means that it is easier to find in the brush.The 9482 also shares the one limitation that I would like to see changed on the 9154. Recently, I managed to pinch my thumb pretty badly while trying to use it in close quarters. Some sort of guard or ring near the top of the handles to help you be aware of your hand placement might have prevented me from my act of stupidity. Is that a fault of the loppers? Not at all, but it is something that would improve already-fine products.As a result, I judge both models to be equivalent in all the ways that really matter. At almost 3x the list price of the 9154, it's hard to justify why someone would want to purchase this model. If the silver color and the cork handles appeal to you and you are willing/able to pay the price, by all means, go for it! You'll get a great hand tool that will probably last a very long time. Its lifetime warranty will be there if it does break or wear out, so you're covered either way!",1379980800,2013-09-24
3.0,"Each spring, the unfortunate combination of hungry mice and children who leave doors open, means that we are subjected to what seems like an invasion of rodents, leaving me scurrying for traps and peanut butter.Our last successful catch was a sticky strip that unfortunately left me having to deal with a scared, stuck mouse. After having had to physically put it out of its misery, I decided to explore additional options. (I am not particularly sentimental about mice, but it's still not something that I look forward to doing.)This one-time use, spin-based trap seemed like a great idea.I loved the ease of its setup (fill with bait, pull to prime, and place), and I liked the construction of this unit (easy to unset and reset).Unfortunately, in the weeks since I placed this trap, it has sat silent and lonely.It's hard to rate a mouse trap without a trapped mouse as proof. For now, I rated it at 3-stars (Its Okay) to reflect its ease of use, and to avoid skewing its product score.

5.0,"This light-duty trimmer works well but struggles with heavier weeds.  The standardized interchangeable 18V batteries last just long enough, and the adjustable handle and length make it easy to configure for me or the GF to use with equal ease.  Assembly is easy, and the unit feels solid.I would have liked the lithium-ion model (charges faster, lighter, battery is less toxic than Ni-Cad) but at half-again the price, that wasn't worth the extra cost.I also asked Black&Decker; how the NST2118 differed from the previousNST2018which is also sold on amazon (and well reviewed).  B&D; replied: ""The new NST2118 trimmer has the same key features as the NST2018 other than the guard and the aux handle. The unit is still supplied with (2) 18 volt batteries and one charger. No difference in job performance and run time.""  So as far as I can tell, no reason to buy the older Ni-Cad model since they both sell for a similar price.I was an early adopter of rechargeable lawn equipment, and this NST2118 replaces my ancient CST2000 (circa mid-late 90s) with 12V Lead-Acid battery.  That old trimmer was much much heavier, with lower RPM, and non-adjustable handle/length.  I hope this new one lasts me just as long.  The new trimmer's much lighter weight, redesigned trigger, and adjustable length and handle are much easier on my arms, although the unit does still transmit vibration up the shaft.I need to use both battery packs to do my normal string-trimming on 1/3 of an acre: around beds, curbs, pavement, edge of house, weeds on driveway.  This works fine for me but those of you with larger properties should look at a different model.Other than power, my only quibbles were imprecise machining on the plastic of the shield (it was hard to wedge into place), and the edging guard not locking into place (it extends to maintain height for edging, but the weight of the trimmer pressing it into the ground causes it to recede back into the unit).So for light duty, this is a great little trimmer that could be more powerful, but the price and features are right.  Those looking for heavier use might do better with one of Black & Decker's 24V or 36V models, or the Lithium-Ion powered models (all more expensive).  Commercial-duty users should stick to gas.For my purposes, this trimmer works very well, and is Recommended.",1335225600,2012-04-24

5.0,"If you&#8217;ve ever used Platex gloves for washing the dishes or for other general cleaning chores, you&#8217;ll quickly become accustomed to the EpicDeluxe grill gloves.  Perhaps the main difference in is that these gloves are not lined.  If you never did like those or dislike the feel of silicone, simply take a pass.When I took the grill gloves out of the box, I have to quickly pull them apart, or fluff them up to keep the the fingers and palm from sticking to the opposite side.  It was very quick work and not at all problematic.  I&#8217;d say I have medium women&#8217;s hands, somewhat average.  When I put on the gloves I tapped down between each finger and the pointer after pulling on the cuff of the glove to get a nice snug fit.  By doing that, the EpicDeluxe grill gloves fit much better and I didn&#8217;t have to struggle to get them on.Fit?  Well, just a guesstimate, but I&#8217;d say a women&#8217;s medium to a man&#8217;s large would be the best fit for these gloves.  Anyone with extra large finger or wide hands many have trouble putting them on.  On the other hand if you have very small hands you&#8217;ll swim in them.  They are nicely textured with miniature orange hearts that give the gloves really nice gripping power.  They flex quite easily and I was able to manage working with them on the stovetop and in the oven.I&#8217;m not a BBQ person, but using these in the kitchen work quite nicely as well.  I had no problem pulling out oven racks, a feature I really like, or moving pans.  Unless you have reason to use them for hours on end, they are quite comfortable.  When I was through using them, they were very easy to remove and place on the counter.The EpicDeluxe grill gloves are multi-purpose ones and definitely protect the hands.

Easy for me, but it may depend on the kind of hose you use. (Mine's pretty thick and doesn't kink easily.)The only thing I don't like about the CobraCo is that the lid doesn't fit.

As other reviewers have pointed out the set isn't cheap, but basically you are paying someone else to plant seeds in peat pots for you.  If you are an experienced hydroponicist, or have a large garden, you probably wouldn't give this a second glance anyway.  But if you're a container gardener with a busy schedule, this might be a fire-and-forget solution, we'll see - I only just got mine planted!The beauty of the process is how little time it takes.  Loosen up the soil in your container (I'd say at least seven inches of soil are called for,) peel the label off the pods, peel off the product info sticker UNDER the label (that couldn't've been one piece?!?) push the pod into the soil, scatter the little packet of plant food over all, and water.As others have pointed out, this would be worth more if it provided a bigger selection of herbs.  Maybe we'll see more options (and hopefully more reasonable prices) if the idea takes off.  As someone who owns an (attic-stored)AeroGarden, this approach is simple enough to be more than just a gimmick.  More on that in a couple months, when, hopefully, things have matured!UPDATE October 14 - The herbs did great; the tomatoes (and a pepper) STILL haven't quite matured.  That's partly my fault - we don't have a full-sun location in the yard and I got things started late.

I may not be allowed to have a chicken but I can shoot a varmint.I'll let you know when the situation ends. We're still in a standoff.",1376697600,2013-08-17

Because it is more compact.- A little bit more dusty but it's part of the charcoal fun/curse.- That is it!!!Pros:- It burns more evenly...which gives way to the next point.- It actually burns hotter because there is more surface area lit and burning as opposed tothe name brand charcoal.- No chemical smell, and actually while unlit it has a faint coconut smell but itdoes not pass it to the food.- It lasts up to 10-15 minutes longer than the name brand, mostly because it really feels compactedand therefore it burns slower.- It's from a highly renewable source.- It burns completely....no half pieces left, no little chunks, just ash.",1287705600,2010-10-22

5.0,"This medium trap is perfect for the smaller nuisance animals:  rabbits and squirrels.  The easy set feature is an amazing feat in engineering.  Construction is solid and will hold up for years, although it will likely rust after enough use and time.  A previous trap in a different size I bought began rusting after a year or two but still works.The wire on this medium size trap is far enough apart for my husband to stick the barrel of a Ruger 10-22 rifle in it.  Let's face it - on a farm, nuisance animals have to be put down, and these traps fulfill that purpose, despite the name.Judging by the quality construction of the old trap versus the new, Havahart hasn't changed.  It is still the same quality product today that it was in years past.  Buy with confidence.Trapping success rate depends on bait and the animal you're trying to catch.  There are always a few that know what to avoid like my local rabbits that prefer to dine in safety on my flowers rather  than bait.",1366761600,2013-04-24

3.0,"Tomcat has several types of Mouse Killer stations. The Mouse Killer I version, this one, is a refillable black box with a clear plastic cover. It comes with four bait blocks (Bromethalin) and has an opening through which the mouse will walk toward the bait. The four bait blocks are all contained in a single plastic wrapper so once you open the wrapper, all four bait blocks are exposed unless you firmly rewrap them. This particular unit is child and dog resistant. There is a single bait box contained in this package. I prefer the stations which have bait already in them, or would prefer individually wrapped bait blocks.",1401494400,2014-05-31
2.0,"I have to admit that I was really looking forward to receiving this contraption.  I have a lot of suet and bird seed stored in a shed in my yard that mice have been continuously getting the better of.  I have used a lot of the old fashioned traps that work ok most of the time.  But the idea of zapping the little buggers and then just dumping them out quick and easy like appealed to me.  Unfortunately this new space age take on an old theme leaves a lot to be desired.  I have to start by mentioning the horrible battery compartment that other reviewers here have well verified as being,...Well, just horrible. It fools you at first look that it will be easy for its right on top of the unit.  However once you start trying to insert the 4 c batteries included, you will find it a total exercise in frustration.  I had to eventually use a screwdriver, as well as in the end ask for the aid of my son in holding down the batteries already inserted in order to get them all secured.  Its horribly tight, cheaply made, and I challenge anyone to get the batteries in this thing without using some very colorful metaphors.  Once armed and hot, the instructions are pretty simple. Load bait, place, dump the dead rat.  The first night that I used it, I caught a mouse, and continued too on and off for several hours.  I would say that about one time in three either the trap failed to work, or some scholarly mouse found a way to get to the peanut butter bait from behind without entering.  But this traps lack of a total kill ratio is not my major complaint with it.  I think its a great idea that this model merely represents an early prototype of.  First up is the electric shock that some other reviewers here re portably got while loading the batteries. That didn't happen to me, but the fact that it happened at all to anyone else is totally unacceptable.  I have used tasers and stun guns of all kinds in the past, and have never once suffered an accidental shock while just handling the batteries, or the outside of the unit.  This trap is very cheaply constructed, and the fact that some reviewers got a shock from it shows that either it is poorly insulated overall, or that the quality control on the unit is most lackluster indeed.  There has also been a couple of stories in other reviews of traps arriving with a wire exposed, or the casing misaligned, and some just quitting altogether after a very short amount of time.  Overall I feel this trap needs either another look at its design, or at least some much better quality control.  I judge it unacceptable the way it is.A couple of last points worth mentioning.  Although it should go without saying, this thing is an absolute no no to be used around crawling infants, or any little kid that could just comes across it and finds it fascinating.  If this trap is able to detect a mouse or rat entering it, I can't imagine it having any problem with mistaking a small hand or arm probing around its innards, and thus activating its shock. A very painful one for a youngin' to be sure.  Finally, the brief instructions instruct you to insert a little peanut butter inside one of the bottom holes of the plate in the rear. This metal plate is not removable at all, and thus over time would have to be cleaned by your sticking your hand inside the unit and scrounging it out manually that way.  Very inconvenient.  Also, a couple of times the peanut butter disappeared with no mouse inside the unit, and I do believe that they managed to get at it through the back, without the trap actually malfunctioning from inside.  A really bad design flaw in my opinion. All in all, I find this trap very poorly made, somewhat dangerous, not well thought out in its design, and finally too expensive in my opinion for what you get.  My suggestion, pass on this deal and look eleswhere...",1300838400,2011-03-23
5.0,I have tried several hummingbird feeders and while I've only had this one a few days it should be great.  It comes apart easily.

It even has a built in ant trap in the middle.,1399420800,2014-05-07
5.0,"I really like this product.  I was very skeptical at first, considering my only real experience cutting a lawn with a manual mover was using the old Craftsman we have on hand, which gets sharpened every year, but still just doesn't do the job well.Well, this product exceeded my expectations.  It mows my lawn beautifully - and quickly.  It flies over all types of grass, short and tall in short order, and does a terrific job mulching the grass as well.  I also don't get a ton of debris on my legs, which is awesome (though it really does cut the grass up pretty well, so my shoes are usually covered from walking over the clippings).Big fan of this mower.  It's smooth, and does an outstanding job cutting.I've also taken it over some fairly tall grass that I normally would have used a string trimmer over, but this mover just blazed right through.  Awesome.The height adjustments are super easy:  bend over, pull out a nob, lift up, release;  do the other side.  It takes maybe 5-10 seconds to raise/lower to the height you want.The ONE thing I can think of which is moderately negative about it is that it's a little heavy, which makes starting to move it on an uphill a little tough at times - but this is easily counterbalanced by how well it cuts through the grass once it is in motion.All in all, I am VERY impressed by this product.  Definitely 5 stars in my opinion, and has convinced me to buy Fiskars products in the future.",1343001600,2012-07-23

2.0,"I wanted to see if this grill cover would work well for both our Coleman grill and 17.5 HP Troy-Bilt lawn tractor (since that is what many people use these for).  First I tried it on the lawn tractor.  It covered everything except the wheels just fine, and stayed in place great.  It just fit, so it wouldn't fit a larger tractor.Next, I tried it on the grill.  This is an average-sized, 50"" wide 3-burner grill.  It fit over the top okay, though it didn't quite cover the base.  It was about 1-2"" too short.  Then I tried fastening the velcro straps on each side just under the side shelves to keep it in place.  On one side they fastened fine, but on the other the slightest pull on one and it came right off.  As a test I tried the other also - it came off with only a little more force, a little less than what it takes to tear a sheet of paper out of a spiral notebook.The picture on the product page doesn't match the one I received.  For one thing, it doesn't show the 2 straps on each side, so maybe they were a last minute change; without them the cover can slide around, and might even blow off in windy conditions, esp. on small to medium grills.  The side without the straps is billowing a bit right now outside in moderate wind.  Also, the seams on mine are completely different.  The fabric looks similar, but mine has heat welding seals all along the bottom edge.I pulled the cover out to one side and measured it; it would just barely fit a 60"" wide grill of average depth and height, though it might be a very tight fit.The material itself seems medium-weight, has heat-welded seems and a cloth feel.  It will probably last several years (except for the straps).",1404604800,2014-07-06
5.0,"This hummingbird feeder is beautiful and elegant. It's a fairly heavy glass bottle which screws onto the resevoir base. Because of this design, it's a little awkward to fill and flip: the neck of the bottle is fairly narrow. The metal base is an antiqued looking color, with metal flowers from which the birds sip. There's a metal bail on the top from which it is supported if you hang it from a tree or hanger.The pale green of the bottle is reminiscent of the irridescent colors of a hummingbird, and is complemented by the color of the base. This is a very pretty feeder which would look good in any yard. The only drawback I can see is the narrow necked bottle, which will make cleaning it more difficult that if it were a wider necked bottle.",1370217600,2013-06-03

1.0,"I was so excited to see this offered through Amazon Vine! The deer are making their way around our yard and gardens this summer. They tend to come (and go) in cycles so this was a perfect opportunity to try this product. Or so I thought.Assembly was a cinch. Batteries included (and installed). All I had to do was take off the cap, put the hose in and tighten the cap. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when they said you have to hold the trigger/hose down low (in order for the liquid to reach the nozzle)...that's how siphoning tends to work:) ~ After just about draining the batteries, the liquid *finally* started coming out. Of course, I had to replace the batteries after I'd been spraying for about three minutes. Not sure if the batteries are cheap, old, or should just come packaged separately with the spray.Within two days, the deer were back and were snacking on my plants. I had tried spraying it at the base of a shepherd's hook as well to deter squirrels from getting at the bird feeder. Well that worked like a charm. Not! This concoction smells quite a bit like vinegar and that's about all I could smell. If you want something that will work and I mean REALLY, REALLY work, try Liquid Fence. I've been using this product effectively for about ten years. You can get it in mixed form (a bit cheaper), or in concentrated form (which is what I buy). That is more expensive, initially, but it is well worth the cost. Here's the link, I hope it works:http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Fence-113-Repellent-Concentrate/dp/B000NW777E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341177361&sr;=8-1&keywords;=liquid+fenceThis stuff stinks to the ends of the Earth and beyond! Rotten eggs, vinegar, garlic and tons of other great, stinky stuff to keep the deer away. It doesn't work on squirrels though (I haven't found anything that does). And you have to reapply as new growth appears (deer loooove the tender greens!) and/or if it rains or you top-water your plants. Re-applying due to water and growth is essential for this product to work. You WILL smell this when you spray! Don't be downwind of it:) ~ it dries odorless in several hours.I would not recommend Havahart Deer Off. HIGHLY recommend Liquid Fence:)",1341100800,2012-07-01
5.0,"For many years I have been doing battle for my little vegetable garden.  I have tried just about everything, excepting poison.  The main culprits in my yard are snails, rats, the neighbor's cat and birds.  I have several devices designed for larger animals, but they do not work for me.  It got to the point where I began building cages around each of my plants to try to preserve something!A few days ago I noted with some satisfaction that one of my tomato plants was loaded. They had not found them yet!  That was the morning, and they had not started ripening yet.  Come afternoon half of the tomatoes were on the ground with little nips out of them.  I even spied one of the culprits, a little thing not much bigger than a sparrow.  Now I enjoy having birds in my yard and do not want to harm them in any way, but they are not very good about sharing.

The results are not spectacular, and I was actually hoping for fast elimination of weeds growing between our pavers, but within two weeks, green and healthy turned brown and dry and I hadn't grown two more heads.I've never used a herbicide before which may be why I found the warnings so threatening.

4.0,"The Havahart 1061 is for very small animals such as squirrels, rats, chipmunks, etc. with the idea of catching-and-releasing the animal, if you so choose.  Another reason to use this trap over some deadly traps is that you might sometimes have other animals in the area you don't want to kill such as birds and cats.  Believe me -- birds are curious, and I've already caught a few with Havahart's.The trap is so simple it comes only with a one-page manual and thankfully the trap arrives pre-assembled.  The manual gives ideas on some of the best bait for luring various animals.  I've tested the trap trigger with my hand, and it triggered every time.In my experience in catching rats (roof rats, and they come on the ground to eat as well), the trigger mechanism has to be very sensitive.  With Havahart traps, I've sometimes had the bait missing but it never triggered.  To help it along, I sometimes clamp some quarters onto the trap to make it more sensitive.  I've had success with this technique.  Of course, you want to place the bait on and near the trap (both sides) to encourage to animal to put as much weight as possible on the trigger ramp.Note I don't think that this trap will be ideal for mice due to their light weight.  For mice, I recommend using a trap specifically for mice instead.PROS====+ Light with nice handle+ Super easy to set trap with just one hand+ Comes pre-assembled+ Easy to release animal w/o getting your fingers near animal (but they recommend gloves)+ Sturdy construction and no sharp edges that will hurt animalCONS====+ Trigger weight not adjustable (unless you manually add weight somehow)Overall, my initial impressions are very good with this trap, and I highly recommend it for the type of animals advertised.",1399680000,2014-05-10
3.0,"This is a very inexpensive sprinkler head. The Rain Bird works well in the short radius range. It gets everything covered out about 24 feet with reasonable even water coverage. If it is adjusted to a larger radius, it tends to put most of the water out near the outer perimeter and close to the sprinkler. Not very much water falls in the middle area. Since I wasn't really looking to pay much and don't need a very wide coverage it works for me. If you need a large area covered evenly, I suggest a better sprinkler.",1399507200,2014-05-08

5.0,"The clips that hold this container together when collapsed are superior to the competition's toggles and the less rigid stance allows it to be used with a 33-gallon bag as well as a larger one without the bag pulling off the rim.  When a larger bag is used and the container is getting full, you can pull it up to its full height so it holds more than it appears it will at first.  This makes it more versatile and my son-in-law, the recipient of the gift, could immediately see many uses, from tailgate parties and camping, to inside uses, as well as yard waste collection, its advertised function.  I can say that it was immediately put to use to contain Christmas wrapping paper, discarded gift boxes, etc., and did a fine job of keeping our gift exchange area tidy.  After that, it contained a couple of grandchildren during play, then helped haul all the booty to the car.  It was definitely a hit.I had to laugh at another reviewer's comment about the smaller 30-gallon Fiskars product being for 'grandma'.  Well, I am grandma and I bought the 30-gallon unit for myself, so he's right.  This unit is more commodious, but still stores in a small space when collapsed.

3.0,"My box arrived unscathed and the assembly of the trimmer took about 2 minutes (1 minute being used to find a small phillips screw driver, the only tool you'll need).Overall, the unit looks like it has some ergonomic features, such as a wheel to roll on while edging, fully adjustable angles on the head unit, etc. Trouble is, as other people have noted also, that holding the power-on button is awkward and eventually becomes tiring because of the pressure required to keep it engaged. The trimmer design could be better so that it would not feel as awkward - perhaps the handles could be shaped more like those found on metal detectors? So using this trimmer is great in short bursts, not so great over longer periods.Avoid the temptation to think that the automatic line feed feature is in fact automatic. You can advance the string in small increments manually by pushing a button on the spool and pulling on the trimming line at the same time or stop/start the trimmer over and over to get it to advance 1/4"" of line each time you stop and start it.  The latter option appears to be the Greenworks definition of ""automatic"" though it's a bit annoying in that you need to stop and start the thing over and over while using it to make use of this feature.One potentially serious negative was that the included charger does not properly engage the battery and as such cannot charge it. Thankfully, I had also bought the40V mower, so I could use the battery charger included with that unit. I contacted Greenworks by e-mail and after several weeks of waiting called them to follow up. Allegedly, a new charger is now on it's way to me. Curiously, Greenworks didn't want the old charger back or its serial number. However prompt the current response by telephone is now, it would have been even better if Greenworks could be as responsive regarding e-mails as it is regarding being called.Speaking of the charger, this could be a more intelligent design than it is.  While having a smart charger is a step up from the constant voltage chargers that some lead-acid competitors use, the LEDs on this unit could be put to better use (see included pictures above). The current design of the charger lights is less than helpful since three possible battery conditions are indicated by one combination of lights (left red, green right). Why is this a problem?  Well, one of the states includes a battery pack that is too hot. Good design practice would dictate that the user be alerted to this issue because it can literally be explosive.It's not that hard to make the LEDs behave differently based on the current condition of the battery pack, the designers simply didn't elect to do so. For example, it is trivial to combine red and green LEDs to make a orange color, which might be a good cue for the ""battery too hot"" condition. Same LED count on the PCB, just a smarter application of the microprocessor running them. According to other customers anecdotes, it appears that a dangerous battery condition is indicated with a orange light - just not not per the manual or the attached tag.Anyhow, while I am pleased overall with the product (other than the less-than automatic) ""automatic"" line feed, I am quite unimpressed with the company behind the product. Try contacting the company behind the Neuton sometime. I had an e-mail response within 8 hours, offering to sell me a spare mower part that had broken. With this sort of e-mail support (4 weeks and counting) I wonder why Greenworks bothers publishing an e-mail address at all. All it will do is aggravate those seeking support from Greenworks.",1338595200,2012-06-02
5.0,I have went through several chimneys over the years.  Although they were only a few dollars cheaper they needed replacement after a couple of years mainly due to rust and failure brought on by heat.  I have owned this thing for nearly 3 years and I can say it is built like a tank.  One plus is it holds the proper amount of coals for a standard kettle grill.  It  also lights faster and more consistent than the other cheaper chimney's I have owned.  The reason is the design; it has a cone shaped grate that the coals sit on instead of a standard flat grate.Pay the extra $5 and pick this up because you will not be disappointed.  Two sheets of newspaper and a lighter is all it takes to get away from that nasty lighter fluid.,1265673600,2010-02-09

Easy to fill and hang. And, the best part, I LOVE the design concept of 2 separate feeders in one. I anxiously filled each compartment with a different mix in hopes of attracting multiple species of birds.

5.0,I have no complaints with this trimmer at all. I love that it is electric powered so it doesn't contribute any direct pollution into the environment. Not to mention that it's cheaper to operate on electric than on gasoline. The fact that it's cordless is incredibly convenient and eliminates any safety concerns like accidentally cutting the electric cord or tripping on the electric cord and cutting yourself. It's also nice not having to fight with a tangled up electric cord that tends to get wrapped up on everything as you work.The trimmer weighs 10.7 lbs which is slightly heavier than some of the corded models but that is due to the large 24 Volt battery pack that is installed. However I don't think that it's too heavy or awkward to carry around. In fact I think it's balanced very well so it's comfortable to hold and work with. The battery pack will fully charge in 9 hours and so far it seems to hold a charge very well. I have used these types of battery packs on my cordless drill and they hold a charge very well. There has been times when I haven't used it for months and it still has a good charge left in it.The blades are 24 inches long and are the longest of any hedge trimmer that I have seen so far. I have used them on shrubs of various sizes and it worked wonderfully. It also worked well on my rose bushes except for a couple branches that are about  inch wide. It seemed to break these branches rather than cut them. I would probably use this for  inch or smaller branches. Other than that it cut like a hot knife going thru butter.It also has some important safety features that I like. It has a vinyl cover that slides over the blades during storage. It also has a guard that separates the blade from the handle and it has a two button activation which makes it unlikely that a small child could turn it on and get hurt. If you have small children in your household I would suggest removing the battery pack during storage to be on the safe side.It comes with a 2 year warranty and a special 30 day risk free trial. This way you can try it out and if for some reason you don't like it then you can return it for a full refund. After trying this hedge trimmer I couldn't imagine using anything else. It's so easy and quiet to use and it works wonderfully.,1270425600,2010-04-05
4.0,"Very nice and handy item and not just for the garden.One of the problems when you are tied back you tomatoes is that you only have two hands and most ties need both (and some more than two). These ties are designed so you can use them with only two fingers on one hand. You may need a little practice at first, but once you get the feel for these clips, you will be done in no time.  And they are also good for wires and cables. I used them for cable management when setting up my new TV and entertainment center and they worked great there as well.I will admit they could be made of a better material, more flexible or malleable, but for the price these are great.",1384905600,2013-11-20

I saw other reviews that say it doesn't last or doesn't work against squirrels, so I'll update this later, but so far I like it a lot.It was easy to fill and the hanger is a stiff wire, so I could reach a high hanger without it flopping over. The internal spring is adjustable, though I haven't needed to do that. There are multiple perches for birds to feed (6), and when I watched our pesky neighborhood squirrel defeated by it, I was very happy. That squirrel drives me nuts!

4.0,We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener.,1318204800,2011-10-10

5.0,"[Update:  I've used the weed whacker a few times and I'm extremely happy with its performance.  I found that the lowest setting is still powerful enough for routine lawn maintenance and the lowest setting makes the machine even quieter and allows for a longer lasting battery. When I used used the machine at full power setting non-stop, the battery got hot and I had to wait over 30 minutes for the battery to cool down before the recharger would work.  Remember to wear safety glasses.]After reading all of the negative reviews, I decided to buy this anyway but my expectations were very low.I already own a good gas powered string trimmer, but I can't stand the noise and the maintenance associated with gas powered devices.  I bought the Black & Decker LST136W for the minor jobs.I had expected (from reading the reviews) that the assembly was going to be a bear.  Not at all. I was able to assemble the unit within a minute or two, without having to open the manual.Based upon the negative reviews, I was expecting that the unit would only be able to handle light-weight growth, and the useable battery life would be very short.  Not at all. The weed whacker cut through everything and I was exhausted before the battery finally ran out of power.When I use my gas powered string trimmer, I have to use a face guard since the string guard is so narrow.  Also, the gas trimmer covers my clothing in grass trimmings (I have to shake out my clothing before putting into the washing machine).  The B&D; trimmer's guard is very wide and only a small amount of debris was thrown onto my clothing.  I still use an eye guard.Power:  I was genuinely shocked by the amount of power.  Even though the B&D; has just one narrow string (my gas unit uses two strings and is much thicker), the B&D; string trimmer cut through all of the weeds without any hesitation.Adjustments:  I like the way I was able to adjust the length of the pole so that I don't have to lean over.Based on the negative reviews here, I anticipated that the B&D; would be the backup unit but after having used the B&D; light-weight unit, no motor noise (I can now use the unit early in the morning in suburbia), the convenience of not having to deal with advancing the string, I found that the reverse is true:  The gas unit will be my back-up machine.  Battery powered devices have greatly advanced in the past few years.I wasn't able to find anything negative to say about the machine after one day's use.",1402531200,2014-06-12
4.0,"We live in the desert so not many people have grass in their yards, however we do. Because of this we attract colonies of rabbits and they are killing our yard and eating everything I try grow. I recently planted some clover seed to fill in the patches of grass their urine has killed, but the whole task would be useless had I not found the Scarecrow sprinkler. I'm happy to report this has almost completely solved our problem. We have been keeping the sprinkler pointed towards the section we are repairing and the clovers are coming in undisturbed. However, there are blind spots as the sprinler cannot see off to the sides very well. Now the rabbits are hanging around the other half of our yard. Solution- we will definately be getting another one of these for the other half. One annoying thing about the Scarecrow is they didnt include a ring to were you attach the hose to make attaching and unscrewing easier; you have to twist the entire sprinkler around making lining up the threads kind of a pain. Regardless this is has been the best rabbit repellent I could find. I highly recommend the Scarecrow!",1336953600,2012-05-14
5.0,"If you have ever used a power washer to clean a walkway or a deck, you know what a time consuming pain the the neck it can be.  Trying to get the cleaning even so that the surface has an even look to it can be quite frustrating and time consuming.This product can take that project and make it a much easier task to accomplish.  It works by having a rotating arm inside the round disk with two spray heads on it.  As they rotate around, they clean the deck or other surface with a high pressure stream.  The body of the disk and the brush like area around it are there to keep the water from being sprayed all over the place and to keep you from putting downward pressure on it which would cause the rotating arm to strike the surface it is cleaning.I used this on a composite material deck and then on a long sidewalk and it did a great job of cleaning off dirt, mold, and bird droppings from the surface areas.  It is fast and efficient and does a much better job than I could using just the wand.I would highly recommend this addition to your pressure washer if you are cleaning decks or sidewalks.",1373241600,2013-07-08
5.0,"I bought it in a local store on sale, for $29.99, mine is the same model, only 32"". Funny, because on the fiskars website there's no mention of the product!I compared it to other alternatives, that can cut 2"" branches, and this model came out as number one!It cuts wood like butter!Mine is very light weight, has titanium blade, hollow aluminum arms, with rubber handles.I fear I bought a product that may be more powerful than the product can actually handle! Meaning, it may be good for casual use of cutting branches upto 2"".But perhaps not industrial use!That's why they probably decreased the size of the gripper to 25"" and 31"" instead of 32"".Nevertheless, I just use it for some thorn bushes in my garden, and think it's well worth the $30 I spent!Even mine (32 inch) is very light weight, I can easily lift it up with one arm stretched, to cut off the furthest branches, and I'm a pretty skinny and weak guy!One cutting blade seems titanium, the other some sort of treated metal alloy. Only one of the two is a blade, the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I've seen, this one cuts the branch like a scissor, not squeezes the branch like pliers; which means, you won't have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches (upto 2 inch)!I highly recommend this one!; and that's very high praise coming off of my lips! (those who know me, know I'm usually very skeptic, and thorough in reviewing the bad sides).If anything bad about this device, is that it's not on the manufacturers website (the 32 inch model), and that it's probably not made for mass pruning on an industrial scale, eventhough it would probably outlive a DIY-er pruning gardens in his days off!",1323043200,2011-12-05

4.0,"This Black & Decker LST420 trimmer / edger is part of the 20V Max tool system that uses the same line of rechargeable 20 volt batteries. It is a nice cordless trimmer with 2 power settings. The trimmer can be rotated so that it performs as an edger (which allows the orange wheel at the bottom of the trimmer to be rolled along a flat surface). As an edger it seemed to be adequate, although I admit that I rarely do edging. It was really good not having to drag an extension cord all over the yard. The trimmer speed can be set at 1 (for longer battery usage) or 2 (for more power).  The ""2"" setting feels closer to my 110 volt corded weedeater, although I found that the ""1"" setting was adequate for most of the weed-eating that I was doing. The first time I used the trimmer I got about 23 minutes on one fully charged battery using the ""1"" setting about 95 percent of the time.  (My second battery was charging). About 8 or 10 minutes of that time was cutting some grass and weeds about a foot tall. It didn't get bogged down even on the ""1"" setting, which is good.  The box states in large letters, ""1 HOUR RUNTIME"" so I gave it 4 stars since I didn't believe the other battery would give me about 37 minutes.  Next time if I can get about an hour on both batteries I'll raise my rating to 5 stars.Assembly: Assembly was real easy and consisted of pushing the plastic guard into a slot (1 screw) and attaching the D shaped handle (1 bolt).Adjustments: The D shaped handle can be moved up and down the shaft, but the angle cannot be adjusted. The telescopic shaft can be shortened or lengthened. The distance between the center of the motor at the bottom of the shaft (center of the Black & Decker label on the motor) to the top of the handle can be adjusted from 36 inches to 49 inches. I'm 6 foot tall and it feels best fully extended for me.Batteries and cutting line: Two 20 volt LBXR2020 Type 4 40 Wh batteries are included. The manual indicates that it takes five hours to fully charge one battery. The following LI-ION batteries can also be used: LBX20, LBXR20, LB2X4020.  Use only 0.065 inch (1.65 mm) diameter round nylon monofilament line.

4.0,"Having owned all three versions of the Fiskars  (Staysharp, Staysharp Plus and Staysharp Max) line of reel mowers and having used our neighbors Task Force and Scotts I can tell you that the Fiskars Staysharp line are way ahead of the other units.The Staysharp Plus is a well engineered mower which uses a flywheel to enhance the push action of the mower which makes mowing simple and pleasurable again. Having come from a gas push mower I cannot tell you how nice it is to get to listen to the sounds of nature while mowing - the neighbors will love you for going this route if you choose to do so.Now a few caveats: If your yard is primarily uneven then this may not be the mower for you as the unit does require a bit of effort to operate(it's a nice workout though). The front discharge is nice but when you get to the end of a run you will end up with a large pile of grass (this is evident in the video)and you may want to consider the optional grass catcher which is now available.I used this as the primary mower at my old residence, however having recently moved I have upgraded to a ride on mower due to the yard size. But I do use a Staysharp Plus to supplement the ride on mower in areas where I cannot drive the ride on. This unit is much lighter than most gas mowers.The blades profess to be self sharpening and have simple adjustments on them. Just follow the documentation if your cut is not good initially. Assembly is a breeze and the documentation is solid. All in all, if you are looking for a gas free alternative, the Staysharp line is the way to go - I would recommend the MAX, however the plus is a capable unit too.",1347321600,2012-09-11
5.0,"I've used Havahart Live traps for a number of years now for larger creatures like racoons and possums but I have a bit of a squirrel issue now and I wondered how to trap these smaller animals. I was delighted to see that Havahart has a trap designed for smaller critters.This trap is about the size of a 12 pack refrigerator box of sodas. It features two doors and an easy set lever on top of the trap. My very favorite thing about this trap is the large metal plate under the carrying handle. Not all traps have this and I've had some scary experiences trying to carry a trap with a raccoon in it, desperately trying to scratch and bite my hand through the wire under the carrying handle. This plate offers a lot of welcome protection for your hand, although I advise always wearing a thick leather glove when near any trapped animal.Depending upon what size creature you're trying to trap, you'll need to experiment with bait and whether or not to use one or two open doors. The mechanism for shutting the doors depends upon the animal depressing the center trip plate enough. Lighter animals may be able to get the bait without activating the trap. I advise using a big gob of peanut butter with some cereal or nuts or kibble smushed down into the peanut butter. It adds more weight and makes the creature work at it to get the nuts or cereal or kibble. You can also embed a metal nut in the peanut butter to add even more weight, if necessary.Also, if you find the bait has been taken but the trap didn't close, try using only one door open. You can easily do this by disengaging the second door cable from the setting loop.This trap does work for smaller animals but expect to experiment a little to trap your little pests. Also, be sure to check your trap at least twice a day because a small animal can dehydrate quickly in the trap, especially if it is frantically trying to get out. Releasing the animal safely is the whole reason for live traps anyway, right? So part of using these traps humanely is checking them often.When you do trap an animal, have an old towel or cloth ready to cover the cage before transporting it to a release area. The covering calms the animal down. When you reach the release area, place the trap on the ground and quietly open the trap. Move away from the trap until the animal has left and then retrieve your trap.Sometimes sharing space with small creatures causes big problems. This trap makes it easier to humanely relocate a problem animal.",1403049600,2014-06-18
4.0,"This is a refillable Tomcat bait trap with eight bait refills that will kill up to 12 mice each.  It&#8217;s not a trap that mice will be trapped in, but rather one that they will go into to eat the bait and leave.  It&#8217;s rather hard to see how much they&#8217;ve eaten at this point in time, but when the block is gone, the trap can be disposed of.  The bait is enclosed in the trap, but the top is clear plastic and it will be easy to see when it needs to be discarded.  Apparently with ingestion of a very small amount the mice will die within a couple of days, but not in the trap itself.We do have pets and obviously we don&#8217;t want anything around the house that can inadvertently harm them.  These are &#8220;Kid & Dog Resistant,&#8221; but if you have your doubts, take a pass and continue using the old Victor traps if need be.  I&#8217;ve even used the electronic method with some success.  I&#8217;m not going to be using any of the Tomcat Mouse Killer traps in any accessible place in the house, but rather in my small barn.Field mice usually are more problematic in the fall when they are heading to shelter, but manage to be busy throughout the year.  I&#8217;m using the Tomcats outside.  I do like the concept and like it much better than the d-Con I&#8217;ve tried in the past.  They came in a box and just seemed to attract more mice than they eliminated.  I also was concerned about how the poison seemed to be spread all over the place.  Not enamored with that method.I&#8217;m not quite sure how the Tomcat Mouse Killer system will work in the long run, but I definitely like the system.  I will not be using it in any place where animals or children will have easy access to it at all.  My comfort level isn&#8217;t high when I take any chances, which in the case of bromethain I&#8217;m not planning on it.

3.0,"Our neighbor has an ancient Toro power shovel and has been kind enough to loan it to us on several occasions.  Each year as we thought of getting one, they were sold out, and snow wasn't imminent.So this year we ordered one and while it is not as wide a span as our neighbor's older one, it did seem to have more power.A few days after our purchase and initial use, our Consumer's Reports mag. arrived and rated this shovel 15 out of 100!  We also experienced a major snow storm with accumulation in some areas of 30 inches.But, we do find it does help quite a bit.  It is not one of the highly touted power models, but neither is the price.  We don't have a huge area to clean and it assists with our regular shovel to help clear the snow away.There is definitely a knack to using it and its most difficult feature is manueverability in small path areas since you have to use it on a slight curve.All in all we are keeping it, using it, but consider it just another welcome adjunct tool in removing the dreaded snow accumulation on our property.",1294012800,2011-01-03
5.0,"Bridging the gap between household and garden tools these multi-purpose scissors do a fine job at pretty much every function offered. I do wonder though why some functions are there especially the bottle opener. I mean, it's a nice feature that works fine but it just seems less utilitarian than say the rope or wire cutter. I guess after a hard day cutting wire, herbs, twine, thread, flowers, straps, rope and opening bags and boxes (all taken from the Fiskars scissors advertisement!) you need to be able to open a strong bottle of nice libation to reward yourself.In all seriousness, these scissors and extremely sturdy and work exceedingly well at all the functions it promises. Even the sheath is useful as it acts as both a protector and has a built in sharpener and box cutter.

5.0,"I've used Havahart live animal traps, as well as other major brands, for over 25 years in a rescue-spay/neuter program for feral felines.  I have traps ranging in size to accommodate squirrels all the way up to dangerous predators like coyotes.Some of the traps on the cheaper end of the scale are made in China.  They weigh less than the USA-made traps because they use smaller gauge wire and are not as sturdy.  I bought one just for comparison.  They are not durable for the long term and the bite of a strong animal can actually bend and break the welds on the wire.There are some very good traps that are made in Wisconsin which I've used for years.  However, I've had to adjust the trigger mechanism with bent-nosed pliers to get the tripping weight exactly where I wanted it.  They are like setting an old-fashioned booby trap but they are sturdy and dependable traps.I like traps with a release door on on the opposite end from the trap door.  Unfortunately, this design requires the trapper to stand directly over the door to open it and release the animal.  Some animals are dangerous when frightened and squirrels can bounce faster and further than one might expect. I once released one squirrel that immediately bolted, did a 180&#730; and bounced off of me before I could move.  The back claws are sharp.  Many times I've wished I could be standing a few feet behind the trap when releasing an animal.Havahart must have heard my wish. The Havahart Easy Set Trap is exactly what the doctor ordered and I am sold.The operator does not have to stand directly over the trap to open it as with other brands.  Simply tie a cord to the handle, stand back behind the trap and pull the cord.  One slight pull disengages the lock and opens the door and the critter scrambles away to freedom...and you are safely out of harm's way.In case you're wondering, the animal can NOT disengage the lock from inside the trap.The Havahart Easy Set Trap is the easiest trap on the market to use.  The one-hand operation is great.  You open the door with one hand and the trap is set.  The tripping weight seems to be adjusted perfectly for the size of the trap and animal being targeted.I use a car-wash brush to scrub down my traps after each use and then rinse them off with a water hose and they're ready for the next use.WARNING:  Do not release any animal that appears sick or injured.

5.0,"The AeroGarden arrived in very good condition and was easy to put together.  I had to double check the instructions to make sure I was getting the water and nutrients into the tank correctly.  The pods are already planted with seeds so that makes it easier not having to deal with very tiny seeds.  The label needs to stay on the top of each pod because it assists with moisture control.  The label also gives the name of the plant(s), it's expected germination time, and it's height.  As the instructions recommend, it is better to place shorter plants in front; the taller ones to the outsides and middle back.  Placement is much more critical with taller vegetables than herbs which will be used earlier and kept trimmed more regularly than a tomato for example.  I'm at day 12; the plants are all now sprouted and above the label.  The clear caps are off all but two that have just made it above the label this morning.  The caps come off when the plant is touching the top.  The caps help maintain a more humid and warm environment during the germination phase.  There is a recommendation in the instructions to remove surplus plants within each pod which I have yet to do.  Each basil has 5 to 6 plants; the mint is very tiny.  Since it is just getting above the label it's hard to count plants yet.  It looks like the parsley and chives have more seeds sprouting down below the label but it might be a couple days before I can be sure.The two types of basil are ready for their first trimming below the initial leaves to stimulate side growth.  It has been really fun to check it every morning to see what is new.  I grew up on a farm/ranch and have lots of experience growing everything from vegetables to fruit trees.  But, that was in the past, in a different place which is what makes this, sitting near my kitchen, all that much more fun to do it again.Pods are available pre-seeded with vegetables and flowers, or as a kit to put together with one's own seeds.  The lights do stay on for 17 hours each day.  They are pre-programmed on their own timer.  At least that's the way this model works.  There are smaller, less computerized models available, but they all use grow lights.  The grow lights do need to be replaced on a regular basis.  The lights are not expensive.  The computer unit keeps a daily countdown of days until nutrients need to be put into the water, and the water refilled to it's correct level.  There is also a recommended schedule of cleaning the water tank and replacing the water and nutrients.  This is a pretty well thought-out product providing a lot of fun, resulting in a crop of herbs, vegetables, or flowers.",1383782400,2013-11-07
5.0,"We have been using a Black and Decker 18-volt sweeper for a long time. For the last few months, we've used a broom, too, because the sweeper just won't push the air anymore.Enter the B&D; LSWV36. Now, the leaves are scattering like they are afraid. The weight is easy to handle, and the battery life is quite good. On that, the adjustment dial really does seem to make a difference: the lower power lasted more than 2 hours, while the higher power ran for a little over an hour for me. The lower worked for dry leaves, the slightly damp needed more push.The Vac side was handy, and the ""mulch"" really does work. I was able to clean out several flower beds without emptying the bag. Note: using it in planted flower beds is a bad idea. It *will* hoover-up your plants. Unplanted, not a problem.This is definitely more for smooth/hard surfaces than for, say, rounding up the leaves in the yard. That's no problem: I have a riding lawn mower for that.IF you have a garage to keep clean, this one works.",1365120000,2013-04-05
5.0,"This is a really cute little waterer for wild birds.  Shaped like one of the 5-gallon water bottles you find on a water cooler, the idea is to put out water on hot summer days for the wild birds who might struggle to find some.  They will be more attracted to stick around if you have both a feeder for them AND a source of water.  While I don't doubt that, in my area there is no shortage of water available for the wild birds, so I didn't need it for that.  Instead I decided to try it for when I am raising chicks - I am always looking for a better way to supply water to them.What I like about this:* the hanging loop is solid and thick enough to support the weight even when the bottle is full of water.  I really like being able to hang the waterer as it keeps the chicks from kicking their food into it, and I can raise it up as they grow* the bottle screws into the base very securely so I don't need to worry about it coming loose if chicks add their own weight by standing on it.  It actually needs to be screwed on and off for quite a few turns - not just half a turn as is so often the case, so I was very pleased with that* the carry handle.  My husband immediately picked it up and said the handle was a ridiculous waste of space and plastic, but the difference between us is that he has huge hands that can easily pick up the full bottle, holding it by the top, and transport it where he wants to go.  My small hands can not accomplish this, so the handle is invaluable to me (I wish they put this on the waterers sold as chick waterers!)The only negative FOR MY USAGE is that the bowl is quite shallow.  For wild birds - i.e, using it for its intended purpose - I'm sure the shallow bowl is fine.  For me it is working but if it were deeper, I'd be even happier.  However since I am using it for a different purpose than intended, I did not feel that warrants removing a star from the rating.  Overall, I am very pleased with this and do recommend it.",1367539200,2013-05-03

It is functional and getting it started was easy enough.  Just twist off the large bottom piece and open the battery compartment and install batteries.Refill by pouring more into the container.  Twist the bottom piece back on.  Just flip the switch and walk and swing back and forth.This thing uses a fan to force air which gets granules added to it giving a basic small spray area.  If you want a very precise delivery, this may not be for you.  I like it.  Walking with this it is easy to spread 4 feet side to side.  It's lightweight and doesn't take much effort to swing side to side.  It's already calibrated so you don't have to adjust any settings.  Doing the front yard 20 feet by 20 feet took about 10 minutes.GreenView fertilizers that do not contain weed control herbicides should be applied to dry grass just before rain.

5.0,"I, like many, do not look forward to fall weather when those critters start coming around and have to bait these already stained mouse traps, only to discover later either a dead mouse or part of one. I usually throw the traps away, even if they are reusable, because I don't want to deal with cleaning the lord-knows-what-that-stuff-is on the contraption. Well finally a trap is produced that you can put a little peanut butter in a little cup on the pre designed place on the trap, place the trap where desired in your home and push a lever to set the spring and walk away knowing that 1) you won't be touching or cleaning anything dead ever again and 2)your 2 year old or pet won't be getting whacked by that spring loaded death trap. When the mouse smells the bait, it goes in the small door, around a curve and gets hit with the built in spring loaded trap leaving no chance to excapse the small maxed enclosure. A biohazard icon appears when the mouse has been caught and the door is automatically sealed so any remains including diseased blood, urine and ticks stay with the critter and is ready to be disposed of in the trash.

5.0,"While pursuing feral cats in our neighborhood over the years, to catch spay/neuter and release we've borrowed various traps.One can't help but notice a big difference in quality between brands..Many have thin gage wire, which make them trickier to get the trigger rod set.Some are painted ~ rather than galvanized for rust resistance as Havahart is.Some have had a smaller hand guard, or worse ~ none.When we finally bought our own, ~ Havahart was the clear choice for easy use and reliable function.We've been very satisfied with the Havahart, professional style one door traps we've been using for the past two years.I didn't think that trap  (# 1079 ) could be beat for all around quality and convenience, but now Havahart has out-done them selves!This single movement, ""Easy Set"" trap is an innovative and ingenious design that has made the use of traps even quicker, easier and safer.There's more to this handle then meets the eye.This design is an impressive, improvement for several reasons ~ even over Havahart's basic style.This multi-task handle is a solid piece of plastic, riveted to the hand guard, so it can't move around.This is more comfortable and offers more control to keep the trap away from your body then the typical (swinging) wire handles.The handle is as smooth as silk to lock/un-lock ~ by the flip of the handle, there-fore ~no more fiddling around with a touchy trigger rod, and/or thinner wire gage trap that the rod is weaker & difficult to keep set.To use both doors simply leave the cable looped around the 'setting loop', (hook)and to use only one door slip the cable out of the 'setting loop' (hook).This two door feature is quite a clever design, and both options work the same ~ with the flip of the handle.Havahart is an easy to use, excellent preforming, quality constructed, durable trap.With heavy gage solid steel, galvanized wire and all smooth/ rounded edges.This five star product is made in America.Footnote: For convenience ~ three sizes of Havahart traps ~Small ~ Ideal for catching chipmunks, rats, squirrels and similar-size nuisance animals7.1"" long ~ 2.4"" wide ~ 3.5"" high.Medium ~ Ideal for catching rabbits, skunks, squirrels and similar-size nuisance animals.

That is what happened to the Victor company which has come out with a modern mousetrap which is the only kind in the world that is capable of killing multiple mice at one time.The Victor Tri-Kill Mouse Trap was engineered with three entrances so it can trap and kill three mice without having to reset the settings. To use, simply apply the bait, place the trap where you want it, and set it. That's it.To bait, you simply turn the trap upside down, add the bait to the area marked ""bait here,"" Then simply place the flat side against a wall for a snug fit and walk away. The traps are set when  you turn it right side up. When the mouse is trapped you can throw the trap away or rebait and reset.This trap is safe to use  when children are around and has a powerful bar for quick and humane killing.

5.0,"I set this up by myself with relative ease (I am a petite woman who is very skilled at finding ways to hurt myself at every turn).  Two D batteries are required & NOT included so make sure you have them!I didn't expect this to cover too much area so the first time I set it up I chose a small section in front of my home.  When I discovered I still had nearly a full spool of wire I decided to go all out & try to go around my entire home.  I pulled everything up & started over.Using 2 rows of wire I almost made it around my home.  About 1/2 of one side of the home is only protected by one row.  Note:  I live in a very small house.  I doubt there is enough fencing to go around a small average sized ranch house.  It might be possible if you use only one strand of wire but with only one strand, it's not likely to be very effective at keeping the critters out.I used a medium sized rubber mallet to pound the little plastic stakes into the ground.  A screw driver was sufficient for tightening the wire where needed.  I also used the mallet for the ground pole but a hammer would have been the better choice.I am using this fencing to keep my flock of endangered geese away from the house.  They love to park themselves beak first pretty much touching the doors & they poop mountains.  No joke.  It's terrible.  When I first turned on the fence my spirits sank because the chickens & barn cats were darting back & forth through the fence like it was nothing.  I checked to see if the fence had power with the little fence checker included & yep, working!  Also the charger flashes but it is hard to see in the daylight.  I realized that I could hear it working & now that's how I check to see if the batteries are still good.  Just listen for the humming clicking sound.So far not one goose has crossed the fence(I added non electric fencing on the section that is only one strand)!  I am so thrilled!  I have one strand low to the ground & one about midway.  It is low enough that I can easily step over it.  This means I don't need a gate.  Remember, you don't want the electrified wire to touch the ground!After a good drenching rain I noticed the chickens & the cats were very cautious of the fence & none dared to touch it.  I guess with them being wet they are noticing the shock a bit more!This fence is doing exactly what I'd hoped for.  I'm very very happy with it!",1351468800,2012-10-29
4.0,"I'm not a new gardener, and some of the seeds in here are the same ones I was planting in my garden from seed so I thought it would be good for comparison.One thing the description doesn't say is that while the seed choices are good for a lot of hardiness zones (determined by temperature averages) they are not good for all zones. Some of these didn't start at all even though Anchorage was starting a 3 week heat wave when I planted them. The pepper and the bush bean were the ones that were complete non-starters.The plants I can compare were all planted in the same bed, watered at the same time, and got the same amount of light. My from seed plants are in organic soil that's been fertilized with a good organic fertilizer and compost was worked into the soil before planting.All the lettuces from the pods are bigger and more developed than my lettuces. They've grown very well.The peas from the pods started coming up, then disappeared. I'm blaming the birds in my neighborhood. My own peas are climbing fast.Spinach and cilantro are growing at the same rate as the seeds I planted.Basil is growing slower than the basil seeds I started.The ones I wasn't growing from seeds are dill and the tomatoes. Because Anchorage is zone 3-4, I wasn't sure how the tomatoes would do. They are coming up nicely. Dill is very easy to grow, and it's starting well.The pods mostly had at least 2 seeds germinate. In 2 of the pods, the seeds dislodged while placing them or watering them and for those pods, one plant started outside the pod and one in it.This is very easy to use, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. I do wish there was clearer zone information for a beginning gardener. I knew the peppers probably weren't going to start in Alaska, but someone who was a complete beginner maybe frustrated by seeds not starting.Update- after the summer was over, I had an abundance of green tomatoes. That's because tomatoes need to be started early indoors here because our summers are so short. But I was impressed by how many grew! The lettuce got huge even with my family plucking leaves from around the plants regularly. The spinach bolted early- but all my spinach bolted early because it was so sunny and the days were long. The cilantro did great, and the basil got a lot bigger but the organic heirloom seeds had noticeably better flavor.

5.0,"So here's the deal...I've had a great lawn guy for over a year. The man knew the difference between a wild blackberry bush that popped up out of nowhere and a weed. He pulled weeds by hand rather than spraying weed killer on them that also kills birds...he has a push lawnmower rather than an electric one. He is the God of green landscaping.Then it appears he ""got caught up with the wrong crowd"".  I'll leave it at that.I have a huge yard. I wasn't sure what to do...my old mower was broken and leaking oil.I rescue animals and lawnmowers scare the bejeezus out of them.Sigh.Then, a bright light suddenly appeared as I threw out my query into the universe...and I had in my own hot little hands my brand new push lawn mower.Buh-bye lawn guy.  Hello landscaped yard. Hello thinner me.This time of year my yard is full of baby birds. I quite frankly want to clear it myself, inch by inch, carefully. I also have some baby agave plants that lawn guy started to mow down.  Plus, I simply cannot justify paying a lawn guy.Shazam.This baby works better than my yard guy. The blades are SHARP. No gas, no cord, nothing but me burning calories in my backyard. After all, pushing with your arms while using your legs is like being on the elliptical, but by mowing and engaging your head while doing it, it's way less boring.And I'm a chick and it's easy to push for a push mower...in fact, I would have gotten one of these long before now had I only known.If you have pets, or babies, or anything that doesn't need the jarring of a lawn mower, if you care about ecology and not burning gas into the air, if you want more control over what's cut and what isn't...this is your mower. I've pushed other push mowers before and wasn't pleased, this was a piece of cake with a great cut.You keep the blades sharp and you have nothing to worry about...no oil, no gas, no mess, no danger of a fire in your garage with a full gas can in it, no buying gas, no noise, no pollution.No reason not to.It doesn't come with a grass bag to catch clippings for a reason...if you are at all green or at all into your yard, you know this is the best fertilizer...rather than using chemicals, allow your clippings to go back into your soil.Almost makes me sad that I xeriscaped my front yard...no more grass at all there.Plus, I lose weight mowing my yard, enjoying my yard, being productive.  Hey now.update: I took this to an empty lot in my neighborhood where the grass had grown to knee-high. This is not great on thick, knee-high weeds.  But it was great on all types of grass that didn't have ""trunks"" rather than stems.Because this cuts better if the blades are moving faster, it is simply one of the best workouts ever. Because you have to push hard then pull backwards, you use every muscle in your arms, your legs are pushing off, and you'll actually build up your arms, legs, and rear...seriously, it utilizes so many muscles that my heart rate was in the target zone during the whole time I was mowing (yep I checked).I got a better workout than at the gym but it didn't feel monotonous or boring or feel like it took as long as a workout because I was doing something and thinking and so it was actually the best and most productive workout ever...and my biceps especially thanked me.It should be noted that you need to adjust the wheels on both sides as far as height...so if you have an uneven lawn you can have the blade closer to one side of the ground than the other.Also to wheel this somewhere, flip the handle and the whole blade section is off the ground as are the small wheels...you simply roll it by the large wheels.

To open the bird feeder, press the button on the top, then pull the top up along the hanging cord.When you open the feeder, you'll see the  tube  we used  to fill the bottom part of the feeder. To make filling the bottom half easier, we used a funnel similar to this one, Heath Outdoor Products FS-1 Feed Scoop-Funnel.This feeder is fun because you can fill it with two different types of seeds to attract a wider variety of birds. In the past, I layered different types of seeds in our feeders but still only the birds that liked that seed would visit.  With the Panorama, different types of birds can enjoy their favorite seed at the same time. The feeding ports are fairly large so we can use the seed that gets stuck in our other bird feeders.Our squirrels haven't bothered it yet. The very, very intelligent squirrel that got into all of our feeders last year, is missing this year.  He wouldn't give up until he was victorious. Of course, he irritated me, but I loved watching him spend hour upon hour trying to figure out a solution.  Anyway, he's gone now & none of the other squirrels are as interested in our feeders as he was.  I'm sure that before summer's end, the squirrels will be eating from this feeder too, but they won't be knocking the top off, they'll probably be performing acrobatics using the perches.UPDATE 6/11: The birds are loving this feeder!

Never to be outsmarted by rodents, I tried a wide variety of anti-gopher weaponry, including this Yard Butler Mole/Gopher Bait Applicator.Likes:*Sturdy metal spike applicator with a t-bar handle and foam grips.*Fairly easy to use: place bait/poison in the top container, insert the spike tip into the gopher hole, and turn the dispenser handle on top to dispense the gopher tidbits (available separately).Results after two weeks:*I don't know whether the gophers were immune to the bait, or the poison actually worked and some other predators dug up their decaying carcasses, but I ended up with newly dug holes around the baited areas along with a good sized mini &#34;pitcher's mound&#34;.Conclusion:Gopher bait/poison did not work for me.  It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I'm also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.  I'm not using any more gopher bait/poison, but this applicator is very handy as a probe for locating gopher tunnels and implementing other weapons of rodent destruction.  If all else fails, time to call the pros.",1400544000,2014-05-20

It's nice and solid, won't rust, well balanced.The lid fits nicely and helps hide my ugly hose.  The hose coils inside and comes in and out the two holds on the bottom/side.  When using a non-kink hose, it allows me to pull out just what I need easily.We tried it at first with a cheap hose we have and that didn't work - the hose kinked and the water wouldn't flow - but that was more a problem with the hose, but that's why I do recommend using a non-kinking hose with this.  We have hoses going in 3 different directions and this keeps the one on the patio nice and neat and out of view.It could be used as a planter, but it's too nice a hose holder for that!  It's pretty enough to use for one though.The petina is very nice - it has a hint of green like weathered copper.

I then found it wasn't flushing the lawn flood granules out correctly so had to turn the mechanism.Once I did this then everything was fine and it is quite a novel idea.  Basically you pull out the yellow lever to spread the lawn food and push it back in to stop.  If you get a clump of lawn food and it sticks then give it a shake.  You might also have to do this when it is getting low.As far as the lawn food effect on the garden, it seems to have improved and instead of getting scrappy looking grass there is some consistency there.  I also used this same spreader for putting 'moss out' in and for some grass seed and it worked well so the spreader would be useful for anything which is like small granules.So conclusion the actual lawn food product is excellent, the spreader is a great idea and you can use it for other things so good buy overall.",1402790400,2014-06-15

5.0,"I've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears.  I've tried decorative blown-glass ones, lightweight plastics ones, and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies, including Garden Treasures and this one, Perky Pets.  I've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards.  If I could keep away ants, then I couldn't dissuade the bees.  And ultimately, each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods.  Finally, however, I think I've found The One, although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version (4 parts water, boiled, to 1 part sugar).  There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I'm giving this feeder five stars because it's the best I've encountered after eight or so attempts.  It's not perfect, but it's darn close.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",1314057600,2011-08-23

3.0,"I have seen the advertisements for Miracle-Gro's seed pods and was anxious to try them and see how they compared to our ""normal"" method of planting. The pods arrived packaged sealed well in a mylar bag inside a box. All pods were snugly separated in a cardboard holder with no damage or leaking of dirt/seeds. All one needed to do was pop open the top, push in the ground and water. Easy and simple! One must continue to water daily and should see growth in just a few days.I didn't have much of a growing season left when I got these, so I pulled out the spinach, loose-leaf lettuce, butterhead lettuce and the romaine lettuce. Planted alongside comparable ""loose"" garden seeds, these sprouted a bit quicker and I was really hopeful. However, the pods dried out much faster than the surrounding ground and sometimes needed watered 2x a day! I found them fussy and didn't appreciate the extra time I needed to spend to maintain them.This would be a great item for someone who has no place to grow a garden or one that wants just a couple plants to grow for fresh food.

3.0,"I am a HUGE fan of Preen and have been using it exclusively for years. This battery-operated spreader is an interesting innovation.I recently applied the entire container to my garden, which consists mainly of perennials, foundation shrubs, ground cover & decorative trees. I liked the spread and distribution of the the integrated power cap. There were periodic gusts of wind, as there often are in the Spring, so sometimes the granules did not go where I intended. However, that is not my concern with this spreader. Rather, I found that sometimes the on-off spreader switch worked, sometimes it didn't. Sometimes the dial cleared the issue, sometimes it didn't. I was constantly checking the spreader, particularly as I had gotten about half-way through the container and the cap & spreader started getting coated in dust from the product.At this price point - and you will pay extra for the cap - it's really up to the consumer to decide whether it is worth the extra money. One option is to get a larger container of Preen, and fill this smaller container with product through the season. However, I probably won't do that, even though I have 3 large containers of Preen set aside for this season. The manual shake & dispense method suits me fine. The checking & rechecking the dispenser, coupled with the excessive dust that developed on the cap, just does not balance out the benefits for me.Regardless, I'll still be using Preen for a very long time.",1397952000,2014-04-20

5.0,"I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a ""brake"" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)",1379548800,2013-09-19
5.0,"The Napoleon PRO22K is a plain looking grill with a collection of thoughtful design elements that combine to make something special.BUILDWhile it may look plain, it is quickly apparent that this is a heavy grill that is well made.  A potential weak point is the hinge for the lid, which I will update you about in case it breaks.  Everything else, including the paint job, is durable.I saw some concern over the wheels, so I took my grill on a field trip through an uneven dirt path and up a hill.  This is much more action than a grill would normally get, and it was awkward to pull over a long distance.  However, the wheels worked great and had no damage!INSTALLATIONLike many modern directions, those for the PRO22K are primarily pictorial and miss some important things that need to be explained in words.  If you buy this grill, pay special attention the the orientations of the leg types and handles.  Everything has a very specific order, and I had to take it all apart a couple times before getting it right.  Otherwise, it was not much trouble.GRILL DESIGNThat large metal ring that you see in the picture gives enough depth to the grill to guard against moderate wind.  On the surface is a large and easy to read thermometer, in addition to the adjustable air vents.  As with other grills, there is also a vent adjustment near the ash tray.A popular addition to a standard grill is a cast iron surface, but a large beautiful one is included with this grill.  It is remarkable how much of a difference it makes, and the grill marks are nice.  The sides have hinges to allow adding/moving coals without taking the whole thing off.  Also, there is a clever system to allow adjustment of the height of the surface from the coals.CONCLUSIONSNapoleon has put a lot of thought into the PRO22K, and it shows.  It is enjoyable to use and the design elements improve both my experience using it and the food that comes off of it.",1381104000,2013-10-07

4.0,"I wasn't sure what to quite expect from this, as far as the air gap sizes and such in the fibrous mesh, but when it arrived, it certainly looked like it was going to do a good job of helping keep dirt in the pots.I had to trim it down slightly since I didn't have any larger than about 10 inches, but that was easy enough.Got it placed, got some dirt in there, plant, and more dirt.  I tamped things down a bit, but not too much, and then let some water in.At first, as expected, I got some dirt that worked through with the water, but I expected that for some of the really tiny bits since the dirt was pretty dry.  But once the water worked its way around the soil, and it clung to itself better, nothing else came through.As others have said, I'm not sure this will really save any weight - uncompressed it's only an inch or so thick, and it WILL compress some when the soil is filled on top of it anyway, so the weight of the dirt will pretty much offset the weight of the rocks, unless they figure you won't have to fill the pots as deeply.  But most people I know fill the dirt up to within an inch or so of the top of a pot, so it's pretty much going to be a wash in most instances.My only concern would be roots working their way through to this and weaving themselves around it, but around here, most potted plants are just there for a little while, as a transition, and then eventually moved to a flowerbed or somewhere in the yard.  If that's the case, they probably won't have time to work into this much if at all, but if you have a plant that's going to be there for the long haul, it may very well end up in a complex embrace with this.For me, the payoff is less dirt working its way out the bottom, keeping things a little cleaner.",1308700800,2011-06-22

This allows for fine tuning of the flow when topping something off.The 1.25 gallon size is very easy to maneuver.  I store gas in a larger 5 gallon container and then use a simple siphon pump to transfer gas into this container as needed.

5.0,I have never used a product that showed results so fast. My lawn was mostly straw to brown in overall appearance with some new green starting to appear. This was so easy to apply no odor at all. I just use a hand spreader. I read the directions walked the yard took about 15 minutes then it says to immediately wet the lawn. I just got the hose and did it by hand as we had rain for a few days previous.  I watered for about 20 minutes making sure it all got wet. The next day I thought my eyes are deceiving me it looked a bit greener. Day to I saw yes it is a bit greener. Today is day three I could not believe my eyes it is beautiful. I imagine it will get even better wish I had taken a before picture. I am glad it is zero phosphate and a better for the environment product. No question about it this is what I will be buying from now on. Love no odor and you would pay about $60 here for just one treatment that is toxic and doesn't produce this kind of result.

I tried the hose ""Y's"" which have a switch to adjust the flow at the garden, but they're on the ground, generally upside down and are hard to adjust since the levers are very small.The Bib Extender has been placed next to the garden with the hose attached. With the faucet on at the house, it is an easy and convenient way to adjust the water flow.  It is up a couple of feet and has a good faucet handle. The shaft which goes into the ground is very solid and the whole unit is simple. I did find that it is important to use a pliers to tighten the hose connection onto the Bib Extender to prevent leaks. I also find this true on the house faucets since the ""rubber"" seals are generally plastic, not rubber anymore. I have had the water on at the house for a few days and see no problem with leaking. I will just leave the water on at the house and use only the Bib Extender for turning on and off the water and making adjustments.As of May 24, 2014 the on/off handle broke off in just normal use.

In our case, am not sure that (a) I needed the alleged advantages of a fabric container, or (b) that I can even establish the effectiveness as regards my planting.  I have given the soft-sided container a perfect rating, given that I couldn't come up with drawbacks or honest criticism.  At this point in the season, we, as homeowners and mostly plant buyers, have no genuine need for a container with the specifications and / or advantages of Smart Pots.",1386720000,2013-12-11

3.0,"It only takes a minute to install this product.  You just have to attach the sprinkler head to the top of the unit.  There is a sensitivity knob to use depending on the size of animal you are trying to deter (squirrel, rabbit, deer etc).  There are indicator lights to warn of low water or low battery.  The spray can be adjusted to long or short distances as well as  to make it oscillate with a wide or narrow arc.  That's the good news.The bad news is the product is overpriced for what it is.  We have not yet gotten the low battery light to go off  so the sprinkler is still just sending out a short single stream rather than the oscillating arc.  The ideal place we chose does not have full sun but we will see if the strong Colorado sun can still fully charge the device.  We have not used the product long enough to see other problems but other reviewers seem to indicate additional difficulties with long term use.  Ironically we haven't noticed many rabbits in our yard since installing this product so it is difficult to say how effective the product is at discouraging them and other little creatures.",1371513600,2013-06-18
2.0,"I have already reviewed another CobraCo fire pit, theCobraCo SH101 Hand Hammered 100% Copper Fire Pit with Screen and Cover, which I actually liked with a modification.This fire pit from the same company looks like it was made in a completely different place... the quality is not good.  The four legs are held on with allen screws and nuts, which will likely rust in a year or so and be unremovable anyway.  Sharp edges abound during assembly, so wear some protective gloves.  When assembled the legs are not all square to the frame - it looks like the plates welded to them where the screws go through are not all lined up.  The coating on the steel is a flat black paint, which may or may not hold up for a year or two.  After that, I would think it will be mostly brown with rust, especially the screen where heat will oxidize the paint off.  The thin, vinyl cover that came with it is useless -- it's too tight and the sharp corners on the legs already have torn its seams.  I just threw it out, since it's not going to keep the fire pit from rusting anyway.Is there anything I like about it?  Well, the burning area is spacious and will fit the standard 16"" split wood with room to spare.  I also like the air holes that are covered with angle iron on the bottom.  This will allow some air up through the fire and drain any water that gets in.But if you are going to spend this much money on a fire pit, I would definitely look at the copper ones by CobraCo instead.  Copper will last longer and I think is more attractive than flat black steel.  The mod I did to mine was to just drill a few 1/4"" holes in the bottom of it to let water drain and to allow some air through the fire.",1400803200,2014-05-23
4.0,"I find that when I use a pressure washer to clean something, the results depend more on the PSI of my washer and my patience in using it than any soap I try.  So to really test this Krud Kutter, I decided to use it somewhere I can't access with my pressure washer and see how effective it was WITHOUT that extra oomph.  I have a roof over my patio that has alternating panels of corrugated metal and clear plastic.  I live in the Pacific Northwest so it is under constant assault from the elements plus moss, mildew,  rotting fir needles and a coating of sticky tree pollen every spring. There is no way to get at it with the pressure washer, short of erecting scaffolding.  My husband usually hauls out a giant ladder and hose clamps a brush to a long pole and scrubs it down by hand.  I ran the hose up to an upstairs window (which is at one side of the patio) and used a simple pressure nozzle to rinse off the bulk of the fir needles.  Then I put on a coating of Krud Kutter using a hose end sprayer.  After it sat for 5 minutes, I hosed it off with less than dazzling results.  It was better in the areas where I could get real close with the hose nozzle to get a real strong spray and less so the farther away it got.  Then I gave it a second dose of Krud Kutter applied with a pump sprayer.  I think the combination of a stronger concentration and a second application worked well because a lot more of the built up gunk came off when I rinsed it off this time.  It is by no means shiny and bright white now, but considering it didn't get scrubbed or pressure washed, I was pretty happy with the result.I also treated some vinyl lawn chairs with the left over spray I had mixed and they cleaned up pretty nicely too.Bottom line, when applied as a pre-treatment and then hosed off, it is moderately effective but don't expect that you are going to restore a heavily soiled item to new condition with that alone.  I expect that when combined with the force of a pressure washer and maybe a scrub brush on the really bad areas, this would be quite an effective cleaning solution.  I especially appreciate that it does not contain bleach, so my clothes were not ruined from the soaking I got during the project and that it is not going to harm my plants.  A gallon is similarly priced to 30 Seconds Outdoor Cleaner, but according to label directions will cover a lot more square footage, making it a more cost effective choice.

3.0,"The Mid-West really took a pounding this past winter, which means so did the wildlife in our area. A long bitterly cold winter means the rodent population is desperate to find a comfortable environment to survive the weather. Unfortunately, that means an increase in rodent presence in sheds, barns, garages, basements and human living quarters. Rodents and people are not compatible cohabitants.Several years ago we switched from the standard snap and kill style of trap to live mouse traps. One that was especially effective for us was the smoke-colored plastic tube with the door at one end. A small amount of peanut butter on a cracker usually did the trick. When I saw this multi-catch model from TOMCAT I thought maybe I could reduce the number of traps I was using. In this case, maybe less would be better.The TOMCAT Multiple-Catch Mouse Trap is manufactured in Madison, Wisconsin, about a two-hour drive from where I live, and is a much larger than the traps we were using. It is made out of grey plastic in the shape of a box measuring approximately 7"" x 6"" x 3"" with a clear plastic cover that slides sideways for access to the inside of the trap (see photo). A tunnel runs through with width of the trap, allowing a mouse to enter from either side. The heart of the trap is a windup bail that deposits an unsuspecting mouse from the tunnel into the holding compartment of the mouse trap. There is a crank on one side of the trap which is used to set the windup bail. The company is emphatic that the procedures for setting the trap must be followed to the ""T."" Especially when using the windup mechanism; I will address this in more detail later in the review.One of the product claims that caught my eye was that this trap required ""No Bait."" Now they have my attention. Mice have a highly sensitive sense of smell, so without some kind of bait what draws the mice to the mouse trap? The instructions that come with this product really don't say. I can only guess that it's either curiosity or the comfort and security of the tunnel that draws them. I'm just guessing here because the meager instructions provided aren't much help in this regard. The box that the trap comes in provides the following printed promise:""TOMCAT Multi-Catch mouse trap incorporates the very latest in product design, safety and reliability. As a result, it is the perfect option for those who want a highly effective trapping device that is safe to use around children and pets. Plus, TOMCAT's easy-to-use catch and release design allows for fast rodent removal.""Wow! that's a pretty bold, confident and comprehensive promise. Looking at the instructions (they all fit on a single 5"" x 4"" slip of paper!) there are only two categories: (1) ""What happens if I wind the crank more than 6 times?"" and (2) ""How do I know if the trap is set?"" As I mentioned earlier, this windup mechanism is the heart, as well as the point of most aggravation, with respect to this product. The windup mechanism is very, very fragile. In my opinion, it's much too fragile to guarantee the long-term success TOMCAT has printed on the box. Here is what the company says about winding the crank more than 6 times:""You may hear a creak/clank of the spring that may sound strange. {Huh?} This is indicating that the trap is over-wound but NOT broken. (However, repeated over-winding can cause permanent damage to the spring mechanism).""Before I cranked up my mouse trap I decided to read some of the reviews on Amazon. I'm glad I did. Just as I suspected the crank mechanism is the Achilles heel of this device. So far I have been successful at setting the trap without hearing my first ""creak"" or ""clank"" sound. Turning the crank in a clockwise direction slowly, smoothly and keeping careful track of the number of turns seems to have worked for me.So how effective is this trap at capturing those pesky and destructive rodents? Using the trap without bait was only minimally effective (I'm not surprised), but it did work. Adding bait raised its level of effectiveness a lot. I used my old standby, peanut butter on a small chip of a cracker, and it worked quite well. However, after discovering the TOMCAT website I found out the company also sells the TOMCAT Mouse Attractant Gel (manufactured by Motomco). It comes in a 1-ounce (net weight) plastic squeeze bottle and you only need a small, pencil eraser-sized amount to bait a trap; it was also very effective and is also manufactured in Madison, Wisconsin. Considering the ease of preparation, the Motomco mouse attractant gel was a good substitute, though I discovered that baiting the trap before setting the spring was important because it prevented setting off the trap.What exactly does the trap do? Inside the mouse trap there is a rectangular shaped aluminum paddle that runs the width of the trap. When the mouse enters the tunnel of doom, it sets off the weight and motion sensitive mechanism that quickly turns, sweeping the mouse or mice into the bowels of the trap where they are confined alive. According to the manufacturer, traps should be checked daily for activity; the clear plastic cover makes that easy without having to touch the trap. The confinement chamber takes up about half the trap and according to the manufacturer can hold up to 10 mice before needing to reset the trap again. I can't imagine having 10 hungry and petrified mice confined together in a plastic trap. Thankfully, the most we had in the trap at one time was two mice. That was more than enough as far as I was concerned.How do you remove the mice? The clear plastic cover slides sideways allowing access to the mice. In doing this you are now faced with a decision: Release the mice back into the great outdoors or . . . ? The mouse trap is fairly easy to clean, though there are some areas that present a challenge; like the mouse tunnel which is long and narrow. I don't suppose this trap is any more difficult to clean than any other live mouse trap.I do give the TOMCAT Multiple-Catch Mouse Trap a generally positive recommendation. Though I do think there should be improvements made to make it a more user-friendly unit. The obvious one is develop a better, less fragile winding mechanism. Mice can eat through so many substances; plastic being one of them. This trap could use a metal lining to make rodent damage minimal. Having said this, I question whether this trap is really all that safe around nosy pets and curious children. We have neither so this is not an issue. But there are a significant number of reviews that claim mice have eaten through the plastic casing. Not good. By the way, I kept our plastic tube live traps and use them in conjunction with this TOMCAT trap.Finally, I do recommend the TOMCAT website. It has some excellent trapping suggestions, other TOMCAT products, FAQs, Tips & Strategies and toll-free phone and e-mail contact information for customer questions.",1398211200,2014-04-23
5.0,"The Havahart Spray Away is a good option for deterring deer and critters if you live in an area with plenty of sunlight. Here in central Texas, that's no problem and there's no shortage of animals wanting to eat all our plants. The device is very easy to set up with minimal packaging and assembly and is already charged and ready to fire. You only need to fill the basin with water, set the sensitivity and find a place to scare off the wildlife. Generally this works well for medium traffic areas since the battery will only allow several blasts a day and you don't want to be refilling the machine all the time. For high traffic areas, I would recommend a traditional unit where you can connect a hosepipe. This newer model is definitely an improvement on the previous unit I tried in terms of the battery performance and sensitivity adjustment (the old version really had a mind of its own). In practice it works well at deterring most animals although we've found that the feral hogs don't seem too bothered.",1367452800,2013-05-02
3.0,"I had intended to use this mole spike this summer to repel moles at a choke point were two concrete walls narrow down to about 15 feet apart.  If the moles are kept from entering between those walls my garden will be safe.  It is a little early for mole activity in my area, just starting to warm up, but the new Vine Program deadline for reviews is 30 days so I can't wait to see if any moles do get past this mole spike.  The device seems adequately made and was easy enough to push into the ground so I have my fingers crossed in hopes that the sound emitted will be offensive to the moles.

5.0,"I've had this grill for about two months now and I love it. It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black, rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking, the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish, steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g., hamburgers, hotdogs, etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food, while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on.

4.0,"I hate the sound, and smell, and upkeep of gas powered equipment. But I like the convenience and power.  Yard care is not something I have time for at this point.  I recently bought a Greenworks 25022 12 amp mower and wanted something that matched it in power and convenience. The Greenworks edgers and trimmers weren't getting great reviews, and so I was intrigued by this one, especially as it would serve two roles.Easy to assemble. Easy to use.  I'm a big guy, 6' and 215 pounds, so that might be a factor. I found that after a few minutes I was using it smoothly.  I love the power of it.  It trims quick and fast, much more power than I was expecting from an electric and more powerful than others I've used.  I didn't have any problems with the auto-advance, though maybe my technique (and yard) involved more starting and stopping, thus letting advance work. I loved the edger adjustment, couldn't be easier to shift modes and that saves time and allows me to focus on specific areas completely.For me and my purposes, this works great.",1399852800,2014-05-12
4.0,"This is a small container of rooting hormone suitable for home gardeners. The active ingredient is indole-3-butyric acid (0.1%), which is a very commonly used rooting hormone for both commercial and home gardeners. According to the instructions, you simply moisten the ends of your cuttings slightly, dip them in the Take Root powder, plant them in potting soil, and mist regularly until you see signs of growth. While indole-3-butryic acid is a common gardening aid, it is toxic; it can cause skin, eye, and breathing irritation. If swallowed, you need to contact a poison center immediately. Surprisingly, for such a potential toxin, this little jar does not come with a child-safe lid, so you really do need to take precautions to make sure that it does not fall into the hands of inquisitive small children.I've wanted to try rooting some of my own cuttings for some time, so I was delighted to find this product and give it a try. The label recommends it for African violets, roses, poinsettias, philodendrons, geraniums, coleus, woody ornamentals and &#34;most other popular home, garden and greenhouse varieties.&#34; I took some cuttings from 5 houseplants: a lime, an orange, rosemary, gardenia, and heliotrope. I followed the instructions, moistening each cutting, then dipping it in the Take Root powder before placing it in moist potting soil. I misted my cuttings 3-4 times per times a day. Four of the cuttings slowly died over the next 2 weeks. After 3 weeks, the heliotrope isn't dead yet; it still has 2 tiny leaves hanging in there, so maybe it will pull through. I did a post-mortem on the dead cuttings and found some residual rooting powder, but no signs of roots. In general, you can't expect 100% success when rooting cuttings. Perhaps they will work, perhaps they won't, but rooting hormone is supposed to both increase your chances of success and speed the process along. After my very low success rate with my initial trials with Take Root, I did some more research and found that I should have made sure my cuttings were taken at a node. I should also have removed all but a few top leaves to improve chances of success.In any case, after 3 weeks, I can't really say that I've had any success with Take Root. It probably works as well as any similar product based on indole-3-butryic acid, but I personally haven't had any luck yet. If you are fairly skilled at growing plants from cuttings, this product will probably work fine for you. If you haven't started plants from cuttings before, be aware that you will need some experience and luck to get this, or any similar product, to work.",1393200000,2014-02-24

4.0,"I've been using a Weber charcoal grill for over 20 years, and though I think charcoal and wood are the best ways to grill, they're not very convenient, especially when you want to go out and quickly grill a couple of steaks or fish fillets. It takes at least 30-40 minutes to start the fire and preheat the grill. I decided I needed a gas grill.What I really wanted was aWeber 3741001 Genesis E-310 Propane Gas Grill, Black. I've cooked on them, and they're the absolute gold standard for backyard grills as far as I'm concerned. At the same time, $650 was a bit over my budget. I thought about theWeber 4411001 Spirit E-210 Propane Grill, Black, and then I saw this grill for around $50 less. I'd seen the smaller Q grills at home stores and they looked to be of pretty decent quality... so I ordered a Q320, and the optional cover.The grill assembled pretty quickly, despite all the parts. I was a bit concerned that so much of it is plastic, but then plastic doesn't rust, and we get a lot of snow and rain in Michigan. Plastic parts might break, but then, Weber's been around for a long time, and I'm pretty sure spare parts will be available for the reasonable future. If I keep the cover on it should last. I'm also just a little concerned about the disposable aluminum drip pan- it's an odd size, which pretty much locks you into the Weber replacements, but they're not very expensive, and should be available for a long time. If not, you could probably make something out of heavy-duty aluminum foil that would work in a pinch.The photos make it appear as if the Q320 has an enclosed lower section, which it doesn't. There's a flexible plastic sheet that hides the Propane tank from view, but there's nothing structural about it. If that's a concern, the Spirit 220, which has a steel enclosure under the grill,  might be a better choice. I'm already half tempted to remove the sheet, roll it up, and put it in the basement.The burner design on the 320 is a little different from most grills. There are two burners, but one runs around the outer perimeter, and one runs down the middle of the grill. Normally, both are used to heat the entire surface of the grill, but the outer burner alone can be used for indirect grilling- very handy for doing a chicken or turkey, or maybe even smoking. (The manual doesn't say anything about smoking but I suspect you could do it.) Another nice touch is the front mounted thermometer, attached with stainless steel hardware.So far I've roasted a half dozen peppers, and I was impressed with how easy the grill lit, and how fast it heated up. The construction- cast aluminum, stainless steel and plastic, for the most part- means it should be rust free for a long time. I'll try to update this review in six month or a year, but so far I'm pretty happy with my purchase.UPDATE: It's been almost a year, and I'm still very happy with the grill. Last night I grilled marinated shrimp and potatoes for two; a few weeks ago I grilled hamburgers for 30. The grill was able to handles all these jobs with no problems.Update 2: It's now been in regular use for over three years, with no problems, and it still looks like new.",1284595200,2010-09-16
3.0,"Fortunately, we have another measuring cup that can be used for theDeer Off 32 Ounce Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Repellent Concentrate DF32CP-4because ours arrived in three pieces and the cap was loose on the bottle.  No leakage destroyed anything, so we immediately mixed up a batch of repellent, put it into a new spray bottle and sprayed it on the flowers, foliage, and landscaping surrounding our home.  Most of the flowers have already been consumed by the deer, but they sure do like to return and their ""deposits"" create an unsightly and hazardous reminder that they live in the woods.  Since applying the pungent spray, we have noticed a reduction, but not an elimination of deer in the area.  I won't be purchasing another bottle of this product when it's emptied, but that is just me.  It's okay, but not worth the price in my opinion, especially since a spray container isn't included and the cup was broken.

4.0,"I think leaf mulch is the best, my county even recycles the leaf collection back to the public as a branded product.  I compared this product to my TORO handheld electric blower/mulcher with chrome impellar and a Craftsman gasoline chipper, mainly ued for branches and incidentally leaves.Packaging is pretty good and everything arrived undamaged.  It was pretty easy to assemble; I did not even need to use instructions!  The legs are made from aluminum and are height adjustable (with measurement markings).  Even if you are fairly short or tall, you should be able to set the height to your liking.  The rest of it is made from sturdy plastic.  The motor is quite strong and since it's electric will require barely any maintenance.  The cutting mechanism is merely heavy guage weed wacker string.For dry leaves and thick twigs, I thought this shredder worked fairly well.  I mounted it inside my garbage can, since I didn't have any wide mouth bags that would fit (and it doesn't come with one...)  Ear protection and eye protection are a must as this thing gets very loud and the top is fairly open and could potentiall throw twigs out.  After the first couple handful of leaves, the fine dust coats the hopper and makes most of the leaves slide into the shredder easily.  Sometimes, I used long twigs to help it along.  I confess, it was tempting to use my hands to mush the leaves in, but if you look into the mouth of the shredder, you realize it will take your fingers off and mangle your hand, in less than a second.  I fed this machine a mix of dry pear leaves, pine needles, and twigs of varying sizes.  What I got was some nice mulch quickly which I then dumped promptly into my garden bed. I also got a runny nose from all the fine dust, so if you have a surgical mask, I recommend you wear that too.  The legs pop off easily and I store all the pieces inside one of those very large black plastic disposable planters.For comparison, the SunJoe is is farily well built compared to the other two tools I mentioned above.  You have to have a lot of patience with the TORO if you are going to mulch a large pile of leaves with it since the vacuum intake is a bit smaller and long twigs jam it up pretty easily.  The Craftman is like bringing a bulldozer to a garden bed if all you want to do it mulch leaves and twigs.  As a one-task machine, the SunJoe works quite well.",1389657600,2014-01-14

4.0,"This is a very nice end table and goes perfectly with my other Strathwood Griffen pieces.  It is a plastic wicker which holds up very well to the weather.  I leave my stuff on the deck outside year-round in the northeast.  The table has a metal frame that seems to be powdercoated to prevent rust.  It is light enough to easily move around, but not so light that a normal wind will blow it off of the deck.The top is not perfectly flat - it is bumpy - but it has no problem supporting a drinking glass.My only complaint is that the wicker ""lines"" are not straight to the edges of the table.  They are all at about a 10 degree angle.  They are straight to eachother, but the lines are not at 90 degree angles to the lines of the shape of the table.Table does not wobble, as someone else experienced - just visually askew.",1362009600,2013-02-28
4.0,"First, this was given to be as a gift by my kids, and initially I loved it, and I thought that because of the design, I wouldn't have all the problems I'd had with other feeders. To be fair to Garden Song, the design looked like it would serve birds better than all other critters. But then, still sticking to design, it's not one of the sturdier feeders. The plastic is indeed cheap.Now, if you live in North America, you have rats - usually Norwegian Wood Rats. They may live down the block from you, but if you put up a feeder, you're going to have your own daily (and sometimes nocturnal) visitors. These aren't cute little mice carrying disease and eating the insulation off your wiring. These are wood rats carrying disease and eating insulation off your cable TV wiring and sometimes nesting in your attic or crawl space.I thought with just little spokes sticking out for the birds to perch on that (and the way I hung it) would discourage squirrels and rats. Face facts: NOTHING discourages squirrels and rats. Now squirrels and mice may be cute, but BIG rats, no. And all are destructive and reproduce like crazy. I moved the Garden Song as far away from our one maple tree as I could. Turns out that rats can jump and are as acrobatic as squirrels.This is for the birds, and as much as I love birds, I've had to shelve this feeder until I can find a way to make it rat proof.I emphasize that this isn't Garden Song's fault. ALL bird feeders are like grain bins and their attraction is irresistible. In fairness, I'm knocking one star off for the construction and nothing for its attraction to vermin.IF ANY OF YOU HAVE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION, I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR IT. I'd love to put this feeder back up.",1373328000,2013-07-09

3.0,"Living in southeast USA I have problems with these subterranean critters and I have use similar traps that was more effective. Sweeney's 9015 Deadset Precision Mole Trap is fairly well made but it has a lot of plastic. The other mole traps were made of all steel and was easier to use. I'm afraid that I will break the plastic prongs that I push into the ground. I didn't have to worry with the older and smaller mole steel traps.I like it ok but it's difficult to use. Although dangerous, I prefer to dray fumes into the mole hills. I have used gasoline but now I use mole gas that I find at my local Farmers Supply store. It is quicker and moe efficient than a one kill device. I have also used mole or rodent poison pellets. This product is practically useless if you have a large infestation because it will only get one mole per time if you're lucky. If you have a small mole problem, I can see how this could work.",1375747200,2013-08-06

5.0,"The ""Strathwood Coco Fiber Closed Boxes"" Doormat is well made and fairly attractive for what it is. We live in the county and need a good doormat to prevent dirt and mud from being tracked into the house, this mat should work nicely. Here are my observations:* It is a good size (18"" x 30""), but is a little bit on the light side for it's size.* Made from recycled rubber and coco fibers, it has sturdy stitching and should hold up for a few years.* The coco fibers are fairly high, with a good bit of channeling between them to provide a lot room for dirt, mud, and water to fall away from cleaning surface.This doormat looks great on my porch and does a good job with cleaning thick dirt and mud off shoes and boots.*** UPDATE 02/02/2011: Going on two years of daily use and this mat still looks and works great!

5.0,There are a lot of insect killers available but the most effective one for me has always been Terro.  You are not just killing the ants you see.  You are supplying them with party food to take back to the queen and the rest of the nest.  That way the entire colony dies and they don't come back.I like this as I simply follow their little invisible trail and place a small piece of hard cardboard on the trail and put some drops of Terro onto it.  I use a small square  part that I cut off of the cardboard flap of the Terro box.  The ants love this stuff and soon there are a lot of them gathering up food to take home.  I had a big nest under my deck and I let the ants carry the poison to their home instead of me having to crawl under the deck.I have used Terro for many years and it works well and it does what it claims it will do.  I recommend it to you as a great product.  I just resupplied for the Spring and Summer ant invasion!,1402531200,2014-06-12
5.0,"I placed one trap in my basement and one in my bedroom where there is the most clothes.  The traps caught more moths than I thought were around though not too many. I don't have a moth problem so the number seemed right.This comes with two triangle shaped traps that need to be placed at eye level in rooms or closets. The male moths get attracted to the traps and get stuck on a sticky substance on both sides of the traps. This only attracts male moths and does not attract and kill female ones or larvae. This helps break up the breeding cycle as well as alerting people about a problem.These are simple, pesticide free moth traps that work. It states on the box it is a Clothes Moth Alert and it certainly let me know some moths were around.",1377561600,2013-08-27
2.0,I was super excited to give this a try.  The humming bird fight over the nectar in the feeder that we have so I wanted to add another one to our porch.  This feeder is BEAUTIFUL!  Much nicer than the red plastic one that I have now.  The only problem is that the hummers will not feed from it.  I am not sure why that is.  I had such high hopes for this product but I guess the birds just don't like it.  It's so easy to clean and I had high hopes of phasing out my old one and getting more like this one.  If it doesn't attract the birds there in no point in getting another one.,1377129600,2013-08-22

5.0,"I didn't get the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off product to repel deer.  I wanted it to keep squirrels away from our bird feeder and out of my wife's flower beds.  Those pesky squirrels have been eating bird seed out of our feeder and digging around looking for dinner in among the flowers.  We were about out of ideas to keep them at bay until I found the `Deer Off' stuff.The Ready-to-Use Repellent came with a Battery Powered Sprayer that works a whole lot better than those trigger squeezing applicators most garden products utilize. The product does not stink and it is applied easily.Well, now about the effectiveness of the Havahart DO64MS repellent.  After we squirted almost everything we wanted to protect with the product there has not been a squirrel around doing mischief to anything.  Maybe the squirrels have gone north for the summer or maybe they are working at night or just maybe the Havahart repellent is working. We have our fingers crossed.I prefer to think the squirrel problem is under control and the repellent is doing what it is supposed to do.  So far the flower beds have not been disturbed and the bird feeder remains off limits to the squirrels.  It has been about two weeks since the repellent went on.If the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent  along with the Battery Powered Sprayer fails in the future I will update this review, but things look good so far.",1338940800,2012-06-06

It provides an adequate amount of light and is easily turned on and off. As another review pointed out, it is a pain in the *** to put the batteries in it because of the screw. However, that's a small easily overcome issue.I've been using this in my bedroom as a book light as it attached easily to my headboard and I like the light and directional function.

1.0,"It speaks poorly when a company does not minimally test a product before bringing it to market.  The Perky-Pet Top Fill Bird Waterer is a good idea failed.There are so many things wrong with this design that it is embarrassing. Only small birds possibly could sit on the flimsy plastic base ring and turn in just a way to drink water that is, if water stayed in the container and didn't leak on the ground. Our container lost all its water in just over an hour. On a positive note, you don't have to worry about water getting stale or dirty as you do in a bird bath.  This design doesn't even work as a last resort for hummingbirds because there ain't no water there. Nuf said.

3.0,"This Miracle-Gro ""Gro-ables"" Salad and Herb Garden Kit might be a nifty idea. The seed pods are compact and simple to plant. And the instructions are very clear. But the final results--i.e., the ""crop"" yield--will be the final determining factor as to the quality of this product. So for now, it's 3 stars. I've planted the seed pods and most of them have started to grow. But, again...time will tell. I also have to agree with some of the other reviewers: the cost of these seed pods is pretty high. You can buy a whooole lot more seeds for the cost of this garden kit. And I've never found seeds particularly hard to plant. Buying ""straight"" seeds might be a more cost effective way to go. Unless these ""Gro-ables"" produce mass quantities of vegetables and herbs, I'm not sure the product is worth it.",1372723200,2013-07-02

When no water is running to them they can be made very compact and stored almost in a cargo shorts pocket space...when you turn the water on you get a nice thin, lightweight 50ft hose.  All great...  Rumford even includes a carrying pouch so you can store the hose when not in use.I started using these as someone normally would...for light duty yard work, cleaning the deck, etc....nothing major.  The hose was always around a wooden deck or a soil filled flower bed...never near brick or concrete.  The first hose ripped after about 3 weeks and the Rumford after about 4 weeks.  Disappointing.It should be duly noted that I live in a home that has WELL water with very little pressure.  Yes it was enough to expand this hose...but not enough to make it rip apart.Personally I feel that this is a great product that may need a bit more work before I would recommend it.  I give it 2 stars because it does work and because Rumford is the only company that includes a carrying pouch.2/5....",1376524800,2013-08-15

3.0,"This trap can serve as part of a moth ridding system. Designed as an alert, it includes a pheromone lure which must be inserted before hanging the trap. It is designed to attract and catch male moths. It does nothing about the females or the destructive larvae other than to make you aware of the problem. Each trap is good for 12 weeks,I placed this in a small room in a basement apartment where some old clothes and linens are stored. I saw a few moths flitting around and thought this might address the help. Nothing has been trapped yet. However, I have taken some other steps. First, I laundered in hot water those items that could withstand it and froze smaller items for 72 hours. (The package recommends freezing for a week but I have always found three days to be adequate.) I also placed a dehumidifier in the room since moisture attracts the insects. Since I try to avoid chemicals, I hung sachets and homemade mothballs (cotton balls soaked with essential oils, primarily lavender, tea tree and lemongrass, although cedar, clove, rosemary and eucalyptus oils also work well, let dry and scatter about like moth balls). Cedar blocks and chips are also helpful although they tend to leave a rather distinctive scent on your clothes.This trap has some nice features. It is easy to set up and use and contains no toxic chemicals. I don't think it is essential or especially effective although it did spur me to address the issue before it got worse.  And that is what it is supposed to do.",1374969600,2013-07-28
4.0,"I originally chose this product for my husband as a Father's Day present, however, it arrived today and was sitting on my porch in its original packaging and not the brown box that Amazon is well known for. My husband saw it and immediately opened it. I explained that this was still his Father's Day gift and he was okay with that. Because before I could say much more he had already taken it out of the box and start assembling it. Before I could inform him to charge the battery first, he had already powered up the machine. Evidently, the battery had a charge and he was ready to go.A couple of years ago, I had purchased hubby one of those Black and Decker Electric Trimmers for about $25. I guess you get what you paid for, because it lasted for a while and just when we though we were in the clear that thing conked out on us. Although I still trust and respect Black and Decker products,  had never had heard of Greenworks, but it seems to be a great product.Things my husband liked about this product:It is cordless and battery operatedThe battery lasts for more than 1/2 hourIt cuts tall grass and deep brushEasy to operateGood comparible pricingIn addition to trimming, the edging works great as wellThings my husband did NOT like about this product:It was a bit heavy. He has neck/shoulder/back issues and he had to trim in shorter spurtsHubby found himself having to bump the string, the same as the old Black & DeckerOver all, the two things he did not like were minute in the sense that neither he or Greenworks can help the fact that he has health issues, and he is not making a big deal about the ""bumping"" as he has stated that this has been a normal process with any trimmer/edger he's owned in the past.  He was very satisfied with this product.

I have had a problem with leakage when I fill it, and turn it over to hang. I'm not sure if there is any way to avoid this or not.The packet of nectar is not a reason to purchase this product.

2.0,"This rat trap is designed pretty much like any standard mouse trap. You place the bait on the designated end, you pull the u-shaped bar against the spring and secure it in place with another bar that fits into a little hole on the same piece of metal as the bait. It wasn't too difficult to set up, though the spring is rather tight, and given the size of this thing, you'll want to watch your fingers. I tested it out a few times with a pencil to see how well it might respond to vermin.The first time I tested it, it took a couple of jabs with a pencil to release the bar and have the trap close. But every attempt after that, I had to literally force the bar to move in order to get the trap to go off. And frankly, my opinion is that if the trap is not going off when I'm trying to force it, it's not going to go off for a rat that doesn't have two hands trying to forcefully set it off. I chose not to set it with actual bait and then leave it anywhere because I didn't want it to just attract rodents without actually doing anything about them.

4.0,"I got these to use around my garden, as I live in the country and we have frequent deer guests who love to munch on our corn seedlings, flowers and other garden plants. I placed the spikes as directed and put the lure liquid in as directed- the set up was easy. Just about anyone could set this up. After around 3 weeks, my plants are untouched by the deer. I saw one deer come up and then suddenly jump and take off, so I'm sure that it was the shock from the Havahart that sent him packing. Hopefully, it will keep working.One big warning with this (as stated on the packaging) is that if a small child happens upon these spikes they will get a shock as well. My niece, when we weren't watching got a bit too close and got a shock that upset her. So, if you have small children that like to wander or play out in your garden, I might advise against putting this anywhere they could wander into it.",1304380800,2011-05-03
4.0,"Update: I do like this chair, but I downgraded it from 5 stars to 4 stars.  The reason is doe to the depth of the seating area, which I mention further on in the review.  I think that they ought to shave off a few inches of depth.  I'm roughly 6' tall with shoes on and I can barely allow my legs to hang down with my back resting against the rear cushion.  Certainly, a shorter person can sit on the chair, but they aren't going to likely have much/any back support due to the chair's depth.Quality seems very high.  It's a good weight, not too light and not too heavy.  The seat is a bit deep, so those with shorter legs might need to scoot forward a bit.I believe it's made with simulated wicker. I flipped the chair upside down and the metal frame seems well-built.  This chair arrives in one very large box, although again it's not super heavy.  No assembly is required.  Just throw the cushion onto the base.It would also look quite nice when configured into a sectional with other matching pieces.  If you a search here on Amazon, you can see how it would look as a part of a sectional.  Unfortunately, you are talking about a lot of money once you add in all of those other sectional pieces.Only time will tell how well it holds up.  I'll try to add some remarks that address this in the future.

5.0,"I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review, good or bad.  I was not compensated for this review in any way.Based on earlier customer reviews, I was a bit doubtful about the quality of this grill brush prior to receiving it. But, by the manufacturer's comments on those poor reviews stating that the brush had been greatly improved upon and even offering the customers free replacements with the improved version, I was hopeful.As soon as I received this brush in my hands, I was very impressed. It has a strong wooden handle and extremely heave gauge wire that does not bend at all when I push on it. It has an extra wide head on it for good surface coverage and nice long wire bristles for reaching down along the sides of the grates. To top it off, it looks so darn sexy alongside my other grilling accessories!As with any grill brush, you should clean your grates while they are still hot for easiest cleaning, before the cooked on food has a chance to harden and dry. With the extra long handle, cleaning my grates while hot was not to be feared because my hands stayed far away from the hot grates. The wide head allowed me to cover more area at once making the job faster, especially having the nice long bristles reaching so well in between the slots.I have only used this grill brush once so I can not swear to how long it will hold up over time. However, it comes with a 1 year guarantee and I simply can not imagine it not holding up well. You would have to hold this puppy in your hands to know what I mean.

Ever find yourself swinging a traditional fly swatter wildy and not know if you actually got it or not? The bright blue spark and loud pop provides instant feedback that I got the fly in mid air! No more wondering if I got it or not. Works great, great price, no mess, cannot go wrong here.+ Price+ Effectiveness (though rarely the fly will and not die on the first zap)+ ON button must be held to operate (can set it down and not worry about it being left on for the cat to step on)+ No Mess+ Blue spark and ""pop""+ Works on other insects- Occasionally does not totally kill a fly but usually leaves them incapacitated and unable to fly_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend looking to get rid of flys without having to clean up a mess. The only thing that could be better is having one in each hand! Works great! I use ""The Exectioner"" and then just a quick vacuum attachement to get them off the floor. Super easy and clean.",1354060800,2012-11-28
3.0,"This is SUCH a great idea!  The solar power, the reservoir, etc.  And it works--mostly.The first few days, we noticed that the reservoir emptied right away, and I had an animal repellent surrounded by bunnies.  (I was going to post a picture of that--it's hilarious!)  We were shocked that it emptied so quickly--but realized that when the sprinklers came on, it sensed the water and sprayed over and over again until it emptied.  Since the sprinklers run 2-3 times a day here, that emptied super fast...Once we adjusted the sensitivity, it has been fine...so be aware--if it's emptying quickly, check that your sprinklers aren't activating the repellent.I do wish it had a continuous water source capability.  Just a float with a hose attachment.  That would make this perfect.As it is, it has indeed kept the bunnies off of the grass.  (Once we figured out the emptying problem.)I would have given it 5 stars if it had an option to hook up an external water source.  We went out of town for 4 days and it was empty when we got home, and bunny poo all over the lawn.  There was nothing we could do about that.",1369872000,2013-05-30
5.0,"I'm a big fiskars fan so when looking for additional garden stakes I didn't hesitate to purchase these since I got 50 of them at a great price.  They arrived quickly, thanks to my amazon prime, but they are about half as tall as the regular yard stakes I am used to.  I got a chance to use them to hold down some plankets during a couple of freezes and they worked very well, even better than the tall stakes I have since you don't have to push them down as far.

3.0,"When reviewing something like this spray, it's pretty much impossible to tell how well it's working unless you treat half your yard and leave the other half untreated...it's not statistically valid, but at least you can tell if it's made a difference.  I didn't do that, so this review is based upon a few observations and some common sense.1. It appeared to reduce the aphid population in my basal plants.2. The black what-ever-the-heck-they-are bugs on the chives were pretty much gone the day after I sprayed them.3. The aphids, scale, whitefly and other crud that lives on my lemon tree seemed to be pretty much unaffected.  The only thing I think will really help that poor tree is a chainsaw.  And a bonfire.4. My roses still developed black spot, but I think it was better than previous years.Will I buy more next year?  Probably.  I'm not much into using chemicals of any kind, but this is (theoretically, at least!) safer than most.  I'll still mostly use the old standby...a garden hose with a hard spray.  It may not kill the bugs, but at least they'll wake up in the neighbor's yard.",1324598400,2011-12-23

These are places where fruit flies have been irritating me, and I was hoping for something.Four days ago I moved the Terro trap to a shelf near my kitchen sink. Lo and behold, the darned thing is full of fruit flies, and my house is not (when you live in farm country, you get fruit flies even if you don't eat fruit).

5.0,"Last year a good friend of mine ask me to do some research on composters.  After looking at many different models and reading their Amazon reviews I selected this one for her.  She liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  Since then I have recommend it to several other friends and they have all loved it as well and for good reasons.I love the fact that the Envirocycle is shipped assembled.  The plastic is heavy duty and looks like it is built to last.  Unlike some composters this one rotates on it's base making it much easier to turn.  The lid fits nicely and we have not had any problem with varmints or insects getting into it.  The ""compost tea"" feature was a new concept for me but I have really appreciated this design.  Many of the books that I have read on organic gardening recommend using this liquid as a fertilizer.The only possible negative that I can see it that it is not completely odor-free.  However, I only notice it when I turn the unit.  Other than that I love this product.  When it gets cold in the morning (which doesn't happen very often in this part of the county) I can see steam coming off of it.  It's nice to know that my composter is always working, making good stuff for my garden.  When it is ready to be emptied I roll it over to the garden and dump it out.  I am sure that more of my friends will be getting their own Envirocycle and I am confident that they will be just as happy with it as I am.  Great product!",1327104000,2012-01-21

Attached this item to our faucet, ran hose into base of fountain and now we never have to worry about fountain running dry.  Best feature is the ability to pause (but not lose) the schedule when we need to use the hose for other things.  The connections are very sturdy and I have not seen any leaking at the faucet connections.  Controls are easy to understand.  Set how often a day and for how much time to water, put on AUTO setting and water is delivered while we stay inside or are gone for days.

I got a large tear on a corner within 1 summer, and a 2nd smaller rip by the second season. I garaged my grill from October-April 2 years in a row, so this never saw anything more then rain showers.

3.0,"Here is where I am coming from.  We have a 1920's home in a northern tier state with hellish winters.  Every other year or so we have a mouse or two enter our house to avoid the cold.We are currently mostly controlling the mice with a cat.  However he is not particularly smart or discreet and seems to prefer to capture and show off mice during dinner parties.  This mousetrap's design is the epitome of discretion.  The mouse is captured completely unseen and can tidily be disposed of.One issue we have had with other traps is again, our cat.  Both the normal spring type trap and glue traps have somehow ended up stuck one of our cat's feet. Poison traps are also out, because if the cat did not eat the poison outright, it is possible he could eat poisoned mice. We were hoping to find some kind of trap we could use that would be cat proof and this one seems to fit the bill.  We have set two out and although they appear to have been batted around a little, they are not affixed the cat's legs, which is an improvement.The cost does seem a little steep for a disposable solution, but in the long run, a lot cheaper than the cat.  I love the absolute ease of use. I guess the true value of the traps will become apparent if/when they catch mice.Which brings me to the problem with writing this review. As I said, we typically only see a mouse once every other year. However, should either the cat or the traps catch one, I will update the review.Updated Score 3/29/11Cat - 5Mousetrap - 0  (despite rebaiting, but the cat found the hole they were coming in, now it's closed.)May the best solution win.",1287187200,2010-10-16

4.0,"I grow a small vegetable garden every year in my back yard.  It's not much to write home about, but I am quite fond of it and don't like it when the neighbor's cat decides that my nicely rowed mounds and raised bed are it's new dumping ground.  I have often gone out in the morning to find where that cat (one cat in particular) has destroyed an area of my garden, leaving my baby seedlings lying around dying and soil scattered everywhere.  And also lying there is big pile of cat poop that I have to pick up and discard. I repair the damage as best I can but the cat comes back again and again to repeat it's havoc.I sprinkled a bunch of this pepper loaded stuff all around the perimeters of my garden and especially on the corners where the cat prefers to attack.  So far I haven't seen any sign of the cat since then (it's been several days) and I'm hoping this product is working at keeping the little beast at bay.  I like cats, I even have my own indoor cats, but I've seen this cat numerous times in my back yard and have chased him out more times than I like to think about.If this product continues to keep the cat away then I will keep using it.  It's pepper so I don't think it can really do any harm to the soil or my other plants.  I hope the worms can handle it o.k.  I like to remain as organic as I can.  I think I will try an experiment next season on squash beetles.  Every year, despite my best efforts to intervene before the damage is done they worm themselves into my squash plant stems and I can't eradicate them.  All my squash plants end up dying.

5.0,"This is the fifth inexpensive umbrella I have purchased on Amazon since 2007 so that's about one per year.  Usually the wind takes them out though the last one was just terrible - the canopy itself was attached poorly to the frame and the cord that lifted the umbrella broke after about 30 days (that item is no longer sold on Amazon).This one out of the box and in the table is great so far but I COMMIT to coming back to add to this review in a few months to comment on the durability.  It seems like anyone can put together a seemingly decent umbrella but how they perform longer-term is what I'm interested in when I purchase one.Here the pro's and con's so far:Pro's:- Nice crank, works with a satisfying ""click"" and is easy to turn- Good canopy, blocks the light, stitching is well-sewn, only one loose thread (cosmetic)- Center pole is standard sized... my last umbrella required a larger than normal hole (2.5"")Con's:- The supports for the umbrella are aluminum.  Some higher-end umbrellas (which admittedly at this price this is not!) use PVC/plastic which gives more in the wind.  I suspect these ""arms"" will be the weak link of this umbrellaOverall this is a screaming deal at $42 even if the thing only lasts one summer.  So far, so good, highly recommended!Update 7/8:  This umbrella survived 4th of July picnics and some pretty gusty winds... operation is still excellent and it's holding up well so far!UPDATE June 2014:  This umbrella is still going strong, works and looks GREAT!  I am very pleased with this umbrella.",1369353600,2013-05-24
3.0,"If you live in an area where the only insect gunning for you is mosquitos, this is probably a good purchase.  But if you have to deal with other insects, such as common house flies, I found this product to be of no help.The product has an LED built in which gives a dim bluish light.  It isn't very bright but it does give you a little ambiance.  Personally, I find yellow-hued lights a bit more relaxing.  But again, the bluish LED is fairly dim so it's not bad.When you turn this on, a fan inside starts to blow the repellant.  The fan is silent and the smell of the repellant was not objectionable to me.  I'm usually pretty sensitive to scents but this one didn't seem to bother me.  It has a fresh, sweet smell that is not very strong or overpowering.Based on the dissipation, I'm guessing this will last you 2-3 hours per night for about two weeks.  When you turn it off, some dissipation occurs (you can still smell the lantern when you walk by), but it is not much.With a name like ""Backyard Bug Control"", I thought I might be able to set this next to me and be blissfully free from insect attacks.  In fact, with this lantern, I wasn't bothered by mosquitos (it does advertise ""mosquito repellant""), but I was eaten alive by common house flies.  I'm torn on what rating this product ultimately deserves.  As a mosquito-only repellant, I'd probably give it 4 stars.  But because I was getting eaten alive by other insects, this product didn't work very well for me at all and I would have given it 2 stars.  I'm splitting the difference and giving it 3 stars.  But you should only buy this if you only have problems with mosquitos!",1371513600,2013-06-18
5.0,"The Kassa Meat Claws are much better and easier to use than the metal bear claw lifters with only four tines.  Those are probably better for lifting rather that flipping and shredding.  These meat claws have six sturdy tines and even though they aren&#8217;t made of metal, do a great job shredding meat.  They also work well for holding down a piece of meat while slicing.I haven&#8217;t tried scooping charcoal in or out of the grill, but no doubt they would work well for that.  The tines themselves are approximately 1-3/4&#8221; long and the entire &#8220;paw&#8221; is a full 4-1/4&#8221; wide.  The tips of the tines are quite sharp and easily stab and hold anything I tried.  The plastic is quite solid and I was easily able to grip and work them both in tandem.  No learning curve here.If you are into pork pulling and are no pro with a couple of forks, these will work quite nicely.  I even tried using them as mixers and even though they are shorter than a salad fork and spoon set, they worked quite well.  Actually a bit better because I was able to toss a salad quickly and easily.  Less lettuce and salad fixings were rolling off to the side because these claws are wide.  A bit of an unconventional use for the Kassa Meat Claws, but whatever works.There are probably a ton of uses for the Kassa claws and I saw a couple of interesting suggestions on the box.  For example, one was for grabbing potatoes out of the oven.  I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve burned my fingers snagging baked potatoes out of the oven.  I think the Kassa Meat Claws, which aren&#8217;t solely for use with meats, will be making their way into my cupboard to try next time there&#8217;s a turkey in the oven.Sample provided for review.",1402099200,2014-06-07

I used them on roses, tomatoes, and snap peas. I can hold the plant with one hand and snap these on with the other. In one case, the rosebuds got too heavy and the clip opened, but it didn't cause the stem to snap.

5.0,"This pressure washer comes with some assembly required but it shouldn't take you long if you have the required tools. It took me about 40 minutes to assemble it including the time to unpack everything and account for all the parts and pieces. It's really not too complicated at all and the instructions are clear and easy to understand. You will need a set of wrenches or sockets and a Phillips screwdriver to get the job done. You will have to install several things like the wheels, legs, hose holder and nozzle holder.This pressure washer weighs in at just less than 100 lbs. and it's a beast to carry. Luckily it has wheels and a nice handle that makes it easy to move around. If you need to load it up in a truck and take it somewhere you will see what I mean it's not easy for one person to lift because of the weight and awkwardness.You will need to pick up a quart of 10 W 30 (4 cycle motor oil) because they didn't include any with the pressure washer. I found this exact oil a little difficult to find and had to go to three different stores to find it. I went to two different auto stores who didn't have it but a local hardware store had it in stock. I thought it was silly that they didn't include a bottle with the pressure washer. You will need to add oil as one of the final steps when setting up the pressure washer for first use.This pressure washer has a huge 3.8 gallon gas tank on it. When completely filled it will have enough fuel to run for roughly 9 hours. That's a lot of non-stop cleaning time. I only use it for personal use but I would think this would be perfect for professional use. It also has a fuel level indicator on the top of it so you can check it quickly and easily. This pressure washer usually starts easily within a one or two pulls. You will need to turn the choke on when manually starting it with the pull cord. It will not start unless you remember to choke it. It also has an electric starter on it which is extremely nice. At the push of a button it will automatically choke and start itself. This is a very nice option to have and saves you the hassle of pulling the cord all the time. It also can be set to start automatically when you pull the trigger. There is a ten second delay but it will start up when you pull the trigger and you can use it for a while then if you let off the trigger for ten seconds it will turn off. This is a really smart option to have because it will save you a lot of fuel because it won't continue to run when not in use. I found this really nice to have when washing the outside of my house because it would turn off and save fuel while I was moving from one location to the next while working my way around the house. I also use it to wash my Truck and it's nice as well because it will turn off while you scrub with a brush and then you go back to pressure wash again pull the trigger and it starts back up automatically again.I had one problem with this pressure washer because I did receive a bad battery with it. It was dead upon arrival and wouldn't take a charge. I called the customer support line and a very helpful guy really seemed to know what he was talking about. I like being able to call someone that is here in the U.S. and really knows what they are doing instead of someone that is in another country that has no knowledge and is reading what to say off a piece of paper. He sent me a new battery via FedEx and I received it a few days later. I haven't had problem with the new battery so far.This pressure washer has plenty of power for average use like cleaning houses, fences, decks, vehicles. My truck and house have never looked better. We live in a newer housing development that is still building a lot of new houses. This stirs up a lot dust and dirt which floats through the air and lands on my house and truck. It's especially difficult to get off the vinyl siding but the power of the machine along with some vinyl siding cleaning solution made it a fairly simple job. I was also able to use the power of the machine to blast my dirty gutters clean. I was really surprised how clean it got them. It comes with a 20 foot pressure hose so I could clean my entire house.After about a month of use I am still extremely pleased with its performance. This is a high quality pressure washer that is reliable well made. Except for a bad battery I have no complaints at all with this machine. Since I had to contact customer service about the battery I can tell you that I expect that they will do whatever is needed to make you a happy customer within the 1 year warranty period because they treated me very well and took care of the problem without hassle. It has all the power that I will ever need. The electric start gives this pressure washer an edge over many other types. If my opinion changes in the future I will update my review but I am loving it so far and would recommend it to my family and friends.",1352592000,2012-11-11

4.0,"This is the second Highwood Adirondack chair we've owned.  The first one, which we've had for a couple of years is theHighwood Reclining Adirondack Adult Chair, a chair everyone in the house has used and loved.  I actually did a video review of the chair so you can see what its like.  We also have theHighwood Folding Adirondack Side Tableand theHighwood Folding Ottoman.  Obviously the king-sized one is just what is says it is, king-sized.  It is wider and taller than the regular adult chair.  One other difference is that it only has two reclining positions as opposed to the three on Highwood's regular model.We made the assembly into a family affair, two supervising and two doing the actual assembly.  When we received the last chair, the edge of a slat was sheared off, most likely an impact fracture from a careless shipper.  I didn't consider it to be a quality issue, but rather a shipping one.  At that time I called the company and found that they were very responsive to my problem.  They shipped me not one, but two slats plus hardware via overnight shipping.  They were very friendly and I was some impressed with the customer service.  No problem this time with any impact fractures, but I do believe Highwood needs to rethink how they pack their chairs.This chair.  No broken parts, but the back support beam was not cut correctly and was too long.  We used a band saw to trim it down, just enough so it would fit.  The entire assembly process took about 1/2 hour due to the unexpected glitch.  There are seat cushions for these chairs, but from personal experience, the comfort level is quite high and it's not necessary to purchase them.  The other one weathers well and the only thing I do in the spring is use my power washer to hose it down.  It can be hand washed, but getting it clean in between the slats can be a tedious venture.  We don't leave the side table and ottoman out during the winter, but rather store them.PROS:++ The chair is weather resistant and the one I own has held up well under two winter seasons.++ It's very durable under normal use and should not experience any breaks in the material.++ The contoured back is very comfortable with its ergonomic fit.++ The chair is essentially maintenance free, save periodic cleaning (I power wash mine in the spring).++ Folds up for easy storage. It does not fold flat, but unlike the wood ones can be tucked into a garage or storage shed.  I opted to simply leave my other one outside.++ It has a very classic, attractive look that will enhance your backyard, cottage, or pool surroundings.++ Excellent customer service (this opinion is from previous experience).CONS:- The assembly may prove somewhat difficult for those who have not had experience assembling furniture or items such as children's toys. I'd recommend having a helper to work with you on this project to make sure the chair is assembled properly and to decrease frustration.-  The back support was not cut correctly and had to be re-cut.-  The chair was not well-packed and was open on arrival.  My first chair had an impact fracture from careless shipping.The family verdict was mixed.  We had everything from a three to a five.  I love the chair because we now have ""his"" and ""hers"" and we don't have to share the other one.  We do know these chairs hold up well from experience, but the dissatisfaction came from the incorrectly cut piece.  Four of us finally decided that the Highwood King most certainly is a four star product.",1362873600,2013-03-10
3.0,"I received this from Amazon Vine.I was super excited to try this out, as we're in the process of ripping up our yard and redesigning it and I was looking forward to having a cool little planter/flower box on the deck to add color to outside. I already had some plastic and ceramic inserts I could put into it.Well, the instructions are in French - it's pretty self-explanatory how to operate it though. But it's really light, bends easily, and fell off with a ceramic insert in it. I think it was because I had to expand to fit over the rails - and the more you expand, the less support it seems to have. My insert didn't break (figure the metal casing protected it), but I'd recommend using it for relatively thin rails and plastic flower boxes.",1404345600,2014-07-03
3.0,"I have the B&D; 18V chainsaw-on-a-pole, which appears to be essentially this item on a long adjustable pole.  It is really good at trimming small to medium thickness branches from trees, then slicing up the branches to make them easier to haul off.  But the pole is so long (even when shortened as much as possible) that doing radical shrubbery pruning didn't seem like the right task for it.  I saw this item and thought it would be a better fit and besides, it came with a new 18V B&D; battery which I could use with my other B&D; 18V stuff.  So I bought it planning to seriously reshape some overgrown holly bushes... cut them down a good two feet, square off the tops, square the sides, neaten them up.  I thought this would go through them like warm butter.Wrong.  I guess it's the holly bushes that are the problem but this poor saw kicked back constantly as soon as it touched a branch (mature holly bushes have a lot - I mean a LOT -  of very sturdy branches embedded in them).  It didn't kick back enough to be dangerous, but enough to convince me that I had chosen the wrong tool for the job in, oh, thirty seconds or so.So I should give this a 5 for sawing through small limbs (I think I did that for the on-a-stick version) but if you have serious thick and mature hedges and you want to do major surgery on them, this may not be the best thing.

4.0,"I like this feeder and it is currently hanging in my yard and has not yet been broken into by squirrels. The one comment I would make is that if you hang this too close to a bush or tree with a near-hanging branch, those crafty squirrels will reach out from the branch, grab the hanging feeder and pull it sideways without closing the feeder stations to dump the seed out on the ground. However if you position the feeder so that the only way for the squirrel to get to the feeder is to climb up and on it, then their weight will close the feeding stations and preserve the seed for birds. For a hanging feeder, this one is relatively squirrel proof--if you can hang it away from other vegetation, preferably from its own pole. Recommended.",1362700800,2013-03-08
5.0,"High quality cart.  I've moved many loads of dirt, rocks, bricks & mulch with this cart and it hasn't yet suffered any damage and continues to function well.  That kind of surprised me as the plastic container at first appeared fragile, but that hasn't proven to be the case.  Moving everything I've moved with a wheel barrow would have been a much bigger chore.The cart also works as a great child mover, i.e. my little son loves taking a ride in it.Two nits, one is when you dump a load, it still leaves about 5% of the load in the cart, so you have to pick up the cart in order to get it ""all"" out.The second is a small joke and that is the cart is well made lacks a back up beeping function, similar to what you'd hear from a large truck.  :-)",1243382400,2009-05-27

5.0,We use this seed ball to feed our birds sunflower seeds. It holds quite a bit of seed and allows multiple birds to feed at the same time. The slots are perfect for sunflower seeds as we dont have many seeds wasted by falling through the slots but are big enough to allow the birds to get their beaks in and crack open the seed. We have to fill this every couple of days during the summer.,1396310400,2014-04-01
4.0,"I'm a long-time gardener who has had to give up the ground game and now must plant in 5-gallon bucket planters (SIPs) on a dirtless back patio. I was really hoping this Ultomato tomato cage would be the answer to my prayer for a structure I could set down inside my bucket planters, then remove and store at the end of the season. Oh, so close...but no cigar. The cross-pieces are just a little too long to allow the vertical rods to stand straight in the bucket, which puts unnecessary tension on the snap-on ends if you try to force it to work. I do hope the Ultomato designers will consider shortening the crosspieces slightly in the future, because this would be a fantastic product for my purposes if they would.Now, that said, I'm going to attempt to plant a bucket planter with the Ultomato just standing on the patio on the outside of the bucket, which does work fine, to see how well it supports a tomato plant once it gets large enough to need the supports. A set of crosspieces can be placed right at the top of the bucket so the bucket itself helps hold the Ultomato up until the tomato grows up into it, then those crosspieces could be moved up to the top. It could be that the weight of the 5-gallon SIP (which I make with gravel in the bottom per Pete Sims' design) will be sufficient to keep the planter itself from blowing over; maybe the Ultomato arranged outside and tied to the bucket won't go anywhere, especially when the tomato gets large enough to press down on the structure and keep it stable.If I don't come back here for an update, you can assume it worked well in the latter case and I'm too busy canning tomatoes to update my review! And, if that is the case, I'm sure I'll get more of these. I'd like to try growing some winter squash on one.",1367280000,2013-04-30

5.0,"This birdfeeder is sturdy, attractive, and easy to fill. It also looks like cleaning it is a snap, and the perches are the type preferred by a lot of our Midwestern songbirds. The trick will be keeping the squirrels away from the goods, but we're always working on that here in Chicago.We've had it up for a few days now, and at first we thought the cardinal silhouettes might keep birds away. But they seem to be attractants--""Hey, it looks like that's a popular feeder!""--and we've seen a number of birds coming in to feed. I had hoped this would let me actually see more species in my yard, and it has, although as usual the house sparrows try to monopolize the feeder.Our yard is small and almost every location for the feeder also makes it accessible to the above-mentioned squirrels, which are as agile as the Flying Wallendas, but I guess we'll just have to live with that. If I can figure out another location in the yard that would be bird-but-not-rodent friendly, I would install another one of these feeders.(I added this part to my original review: We figured out how to hang this  so that it's really inconvenient to the squirrels, and I have seen a LOT of different species in my yard...birds I'd only seen once or twice in my life. It's really cool. Also, one morning I heard a racket in the yard, and there was a flock of THOUSANDS of starlings--around the feeder, on the lawn, the deck, the garage, the mew, the neighbor's garage...it was very Hitchcockian. I think they were migrating through and all descended at once. Wow.)",1346112000,2012-08-28

5.0,"I would have never guessed how big this bad boy was until we got it.  It's about 15 inches tip to tip.  Pick it up and you can feel the weight of its solid wood handle, slightly curved for a good grip. The tines feel like they are made of iron.  The whole tool feels well balanced in my hand.  The claw is about the size of an average adult hand, and those tines could rip up concrete if they had to!  They are solid, heavy and tough. They are not going to bend easily.The sheath of metal between the tines and the handle turns freely.  At first I was afraid that it would be able to unscrew, but no, it simply turns freely. It doesn't slip up or down, and it does not detract from the strength of this tool.I can see why they call it the ""Pro"" Series- it would appear to be professional grade.

4.0,"I am giving this product 4 1/2 stars instead of 5, and this is why.It lost the signal. My smoker is right outside my kitchen window, and within feet of my back door. The signal went no further than my very small kitchen. When trying it outdoors the signal was lost at the end of a thirty foot walkway, but our garage may have blocked the signal.Now beyond that, it was easy to install the three AAA batteries with the help of the little screwdriver provided. It was also a snap to download the free application. The App itself is a blast, full of extras beyond just keeping you informed of the temperature. The App also keeps a journal of your last 10 BBQs, keeps a temperature graph of what you are cooking, and has a separate page that keeps track of internal temperature and estimated cook time, although I thought it was showing a very short cook time for me, it actually wasn't all that far off in accuracy. However since I  go by temperature I didn't really  pay close attention to that feature. It accommodates 2 probes for those times when you have more meat to BBQ. I like that it comes preprogrammed with many different varieties of meats and the suggested temperatures for cooking them , both gourmet and USDA. If you want, you are able to customize your temperature setting as well.It was pretty cool later on in the evening being able to go back on the App and check out how the smoking temperature progressed over the course of the day.Can't wait to try this on a big Turkey or roast beef, when it cools down enough to have the oven on for hours again. I am hoping that when using it entirely in the house that the Bluetooth will work correctly.",1404000000,2014-06-29

4.0,"I think this is an excellent idea as gift or starter garden for a child. Yes you can certainly buy seeds etc. but if you want a complete starter kit, this is a nice concept.The kit includes 18 &#34;cardboard&#34; type pods which contain the seeds and growing medium. You simply pick a spot in a garden, pot or planter, push the pod into the soil until the rim touches the soil, and then treat it like any other seedling.I used some deck planters to start these. While it is well beyond the start of growing season here in New Jersey (I planted these on 7/28), I have done this before with some vegetables/herbs that can be harvested in a couple of months. So I decided this would be a good comparison test. For my &#34;from seed&#34; plants I generally use a soil thermometer, and as the summer winds down, will remove some plants from the ground and shelter them (sun in the day in a pot, then the garage at night, etc.). In the past I have done this with tomato, cucumber, peppers, etc.My 11 year old daughter Kyleigh and I added several inches of garden (not top or potting) soil to the planters and she planted 4 to 5 pods in each planter. As the plants grow we will repot/replant them.In the box you get 18 Seed Pods, which at this time are (alphabetically):* 2 Basil* 1 Bush Bean* 2 Butterhead Lettuce* 1 Cherry Tomato* 2 Cilantro* 1 Cucumber* 2 Dill* 1 Globe Tomato* 2 Loose-Leaf Lettuce* 1 Romaine Lettuce* 1 Smooth-Leaf Spinach* 1 Snap Pea* 1 Sweet PepperYou also get a small packet of powdered Miracle-Grow fertilizer mixture and a little user guide.I did get almost immediate germination. After just 2 days several plants were sprouting. Now they were two hot days and cool nights, so I am sure that helped the seed crack quickly. But the action time was fantastic, especially since with a child you want them to see some results so they stay interested.We continue to monitor the &#34;garden&#34; and it is doing well, a couple of other seeds have broken through. I will update this review as the plants mature. For now I think this is a really cute idea, and while you can buy seed and have more variety, and save some money, if you do it the old-fashioned way, this is a nice, neat introduction to vegetable gardening.NOTE: like any other seed, these have expiration dates. Also like any other seed, you would generally plan to plant based on your last Spring frost, etc. not in the summer in the Northeast! The expiration date on these were late August  which would have been fine for a Spring planting this year, but obviously you would not buy this now for next Spring.",1375401600,2013-08-02
5.0,"I've been using rooting hormone for at least the last 25 years. And all the brands seem to work equally well. They even have all come in about the same size container.Rooting hormone stimulates the plant's natural ability to produce roots. Most plants can be propagated without rooting hormones, but it can require a tedious process and lots more time. Of course, there are exceptions; in my yard, I'm constantly trimming geranium, and I just poke the cuttings in the ground, where they take root on their own. For other plants,  using the hormone increases chances of success; it also increases the volume of roots, which starts the plant on a strong foundation.Here's my typical procedure:1. Choose the type of plant that requires and/or is receptive to rooting hormone; this can easily be found by searching online for tips on using rooting hormone or on propagating whatever plant you have in mind.2. Start with a freshly cut stem.3. Spoon a bit of the hormone into a clean dish or cup. (This helps avoid contamination from dipping the plant into the container.)4. if the tip of the plant is dry, moisten it with a dip into clean water.5. Place the tip of the cutting into the rooting hormone about 1/2 inch (or according to the label; some plants will need only the tip exposed to the rooting hormone). Tap the plant to loose extraneous hormone powder. No need to over-apply.There are various options after this -- putting the stem in soil, sand, or other medium. It will largely depend on the type of plant you are attempting to propagate.Happy Gardening!",1390780800,2014-01-27

5.0,"This kitchen device looks like something out ofLittle Shop of Horrors, but it's actually a fantastic way to inject flavors and moisture into large cuts of meat.This comes with two large needles (6"" long).  One needle is solid with a hole in the angled tip (just like a syringe) and one with a series of holes throughout.  You insert the needle into the meat and then press the plunger down as you slowly withdraw the needle.  To fully infuse the meat, you need to inject it over and over, from different angles.  It really is a great way to make an incredibly moist turkey or chicken.  It's also an easy way to get marinades under the skin of the bird if you like to season your poultry that way.  Just be careful not to inject it too many times, because you'll damage the meat.The injector comes apart and is pretty simple to clean.  If your needles are clogged with chunks of seasoning (herbs, garlic, etc.), then just fill the body of the injector with warm soapy water and squirt it through the needle until it's clean.Remember that the #1 most important factor in retaining the juices in your meat is to let it rest after you cook.  Letting the meat rest for at least ten minutes lets the muscle fibers in the meat relax, and the juices are soaked up from the cells in between the fibers back into the fibers themselves.  With the juices soaked back in, the juices stay in the meat after you cut it.  Otherwise, the free juices in between will just spill out when you cut it.If you love to cook, try something different and give this injector a try.I was provided this item for review.",1370649600,2013-06-08

3.0,"Having recently had my kids grow a bunch of vegetables from seeds they purchased, I can attest it is not incredibly difficult.  They dug little holes, threw in the seeds, and watered regularly.  I was wondering if these Miracle-Gro seed pods could be an easier solution that would grow better.  The idea here is that each pod contains fertilizer and a seed to help in germinating the plant quickly.  I thought we could germinate the seeds indoors and then transfer them outside.  First, if this is your plan, make sure you remember what each pod contains.  My kids, in an effort to be helpful, removed all of the labels.  There is no labeling on the pod itself, so once you remove the top label, you need to know what's there.  Second, I tried germinating them inside, but the pod itself started to disintegrate surprisingly quickly.I transported the seeds outside and no surprise, some of them grew and some did not.  There's not much redundancy in the pods, just one or two seeds, so if it fails to germinate you are out of luck.This is a cool idea, but for the price, I'd recommend just buying some seeds and planting them - it's not as hard as it looks.",1379030400,2013-09-13

2.0,"I was really hoping this would work! We have a springtime invasion of very tiny black ants. They are particularly attracted to the kitchen sink, probably as a source of water.When they showed up this spring I immediately put out some diatomaceous earth. It didn't stop them so I ordered this Terro product. It's supposed to be fairly safe to use but the instructions said to wear gloves when applying. I didn't own appropriate gloves so I had to buy some. Then I sprinkled the bait around the foundation of the house. It was barely enough.It's supposed to start working in a few days and at first I thought it might be doing something because there seemed to be a decrease in numbers of ants. However, three weeks later we still have ants! Every morning I see a bunch of them in the kitchen sink and on the backsplash, plus a few near the dog's dish and a couple in the bathroom. Today I saw hundreds in the outdoor garbage can even though it stands only a foot from the wall where I applied the bait.This product is borate-based so it is a derivative of boric acid. Boric acid is considered safer than many pesticides, although it still carries risks. According to Wikipedia, it is ""poisonous if taken internally or inhaled in large quantities."" In this ant bait, the borate appears to be coated with something so it is not as likely to be inhaled as plain boric acid powder is. I assume the coating is supposed to be tasty to ants. Perhaps our ants are picky eaters because they are still alive.",1368921600,2013-05-19
4.0,"UPDATE: It caught a mouse! Had to have been a clean kill. I disposed of it outside easily without having to touch the mouse. I'm upping the stars by one because the design does actually work. You just have to be careful when setting it not to breathe on it...I really like the design of this trap in theory, the way you can place it against the wall, the fact that you can wash it and reuse it, and also that it won't ""bite"" human fingers if they are stuck in the trap. However, I had immediate problems with the trap. Once set, it seems to spring open all by itself. After the first night, I found one of the traps sprung open but the trap itself had not moved. I thought ""Oh! Crafty mouse!"" But then, when I tried to reset it, it kept popping open and the three trap ""lids"" wouldn't stay closed. I finally got it set, and then while I was standing there looking at it from above, one of the traps popped open again. Am I doing something wrong here?I know we have mice because I see the droppings, but I've never seen them in action. I don't know what size they are, but I expect they are field mice because I've seen a dead one outside. Tiny mice, so they ought to be killed by this trap. But note that the instructions say, ""For only a couple of mice, a dozen traps are not too many."" Are you kidding me? At ten bucks a trap, I think I'd rather just live with the mice or poison them and put up with the smell of them dying in the walls. Even if they are considering one trap as three, that's still a lot of money compared to the cheaper alternatives.",1364688000,2013-03-31
4.0,"Interesting! The week whacker came in an obviously pre-opened package and I was expecting grass and dirt but all contents looked untouched and new. Instructions were reasonably easy to follow; however the description, and even the mention of the wall bracket was missing from the printed copy and at first I wondered what that part was for. However, I figured it out and confirmed it when I downloaded the manual from the Toro Site. Also, there is nothing in the instructions which tells me which of two possible orientations to install the wire edge guide so I guess I have a 50/50 chance of getting it right. I first installed it with the end pointing down but changed it to point upwards after using it for a while. I see the cost of battery replacement is very high...almost 70% of the cost of the trimmer itself. Hope it lasts for a while. I usually like to keep one or more spare batteries fully charged for the inevitable dead battery experience but not this time...not at those prices.I used it once on my yard, a small lot of about 150 x 60 less the house, with trimming all around both the house and the fence on three sides and gardens. I also used the &#34;edger&#34; mode for the drive, front of the house and the rear patio. This is not really an edger with a blade and all, just the whacker turned 90 degrees so it whacks vertically so it doesn't really do what a blade would do but it''s okay for my purposes. Hard to guide straightly, however, even with the wheel so the edge is somewhat ragged. Having said that, I whacked for about an hour on low power setting (really a blade movement which takes off about an inch of the end of the cord) and still had more to go. Nice not to have fuel fumes or a long cord to deal with.Am reasonably satisfied with this item and would recommend it to a friend.",1367625600,2013-05-04

3.0,"UPDATE: The Victor fly trap has been up for 3 weeks and is now attracting flies. During that time, it spent 5 days without a fly, 3 days with 5 flies, and then began to draw in flies rapidly around the 9th day. During that same time, the 2 Rescue brand fly traps filled with flies and had to be removed because they couldn't hold any more. I then put up 3rd and 4th Rescue fly traps and they too filled before this one got going strong. I have read that different breeds of flies are attracted to different odors. Looks like this one just took a long time to get going, so I've upgraded my rating to 3 stars. I also wonder if the flies were attracted to the odor produced by the bodies of the dead flies. My future purchases will be the Rescue brand.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Don't know why the flies aren't attracted to this fly trap. I certainly find the odor to be overwhelming and unpleasant. But the flies are not attracted to it. The Rescue Fly Traps that are on each side of the Victor trap were put up at the same time and are full. Another Rescue Fly Trap that I placed a few yards away is already attracting and killing flies, but the Victor Fly Trap remains untouched by flies. If it doesn't attract flies within a week, I'm going to throw it away because the odor is so bad. The Rescue traps also have a bad odor, but it doesn't seem to carry as far as the Victor's odor. If I get any flies, I will update this review. If there is no UPDATE, you can be sure the Victor Fly Magnet Disposable Fly Trap never caught a fly on my property. If you're wondering why I have so many flies, it's because I free-range lots of chickens and the coop area can become a magnet and breeding ground for flies unless I attack them aggressively each spring.",1366761600,2013-04-24
4.0,"We attached this hose to a traditional 50-foot hose and run it down to our barn to make it more convenient for us to fill buckets of water for our 6 miniature sheep. We also have a garden nearby and use the hose to water that, too.In terms of weight, the hose is outstanding. Much lighter then the 75-foot traditional hose we used to have there. And it's much easier to wind up, too (though we mostly leave it out).There was some initial leakage with the valve at the end of the hose. But that can be removed (it's a little piece that can be unscrewed). Once I removed it, I connected the sprayer directly and the hose is working fine with no leaks.We do make sure to turn off the water when not in use - in the past I've had hoses bulge up and leak when I left them on overnight.

On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.

4.0,"We have 11 planting areas scattered around our house, some 200 feet away, so we have a lot of hoses and in summer often water every day.  I'll compare this hose to both traditional garden hoses and other shrinkable hoses, i.e., The Pocket Hose.First off, while it does have plastic connectors all shrinkable ones do, the picture of the product does seem to make this clear.  It comes with a pouch for storage and carrying.  Compared to the Pocket Hose, the connectors are much, much sturdier, about 50% thicker.  The fabric the hose is made of is also much thicker than a Pocket Hose, seems less flexible but more solid.I tried the hose first directly on a faucet.  The end of the hose connected to the faucet quickly became smooth for about 2 feet, like a normal hose.  After than the hose stretched out but not as smooth, it still had some of the folds you see in these hoses, near the 75 foot end the hose appeared to not expand very much.  It did not leak.  I found that to make the hose contract all the way, leave the nozzle open so water is flowing through when you shut the faucet.  It did shrink enough to fit back into its pouch.We have hoses on reels connected to our faucets but need to connect other hoses to them to reach all our planning areas, so I tested this way also.  Obviously even at 75 feet this hose was easier to carry, than a traditional 50 foot one.  With the water pressure being less it did not expand as much.  Perhaps 60-65 feet.  I have to fill watering cans for the really far planting areas so have to shut the nozzle, but no leaks or bursting.Finally I shut the nozzle and let the hose sit for about 15 minutes to see if it could take the pressure since others have had trouble with bursting.Good so far.  I have this hose and the 50 foot model and no trouble with either one.  I will update if there are problems with bursting/leaks, etc.",1374883200,2013-07-27

4.0,"I've been feeding hummingbirds for many years with both nectar feeders as well as planting flowering vines and plants that they love.  Several years ago, someone suggested to me that I put out my feeder earlier in the spring (early to mid-March here).  The male hummingbirds arrive earlier than the females in order to find an ideal feeding and nesting spot...this gives them a leg-up (wing-up?) on the other males in wooing the females when they finally arrive.  Well, I did as suggested and it worked!  For the past three years, we have ended up with a nest in our large crape myrtle tree at the end of the porch.  It's been fun to watch as the babies begin to fly and drink at the feeder.  Hummingbirds are devilish little things...quite territorial and aggressive (even with their siblings).  Because of this territorial nature, I've had to hang an extra feeder to reduce the squabbles.  Hummingbird habits may vary by region or type, but having the multiple feeding holes on each of the feeders has been unnecessary since they fight each other off and usually only one bird will feed at a time.The feeder I've been using is thePerky-Pet 203CP Pinch Waist Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feederwhich has worked great and is easy to clean and more economical in its use of nectar (none is wasted).  However, in ordering a second easy-clean feeder, I went with this one by Aspects.  It, too, is very easy to clean.  The main thing that I like about it over our other one is that the hummingbirds are much more visible when they come to feed.  It hangs easily using the included rod or you could also position it at the top of a post (safely out of reach of predators of course).  Adding water to the inner moat will help to deter ants.  Unlike the design of many other feeders, so far I haven't needed to put guards on the holes to keep out bees and wasps since they're unable to reach down far enough to get at the nectar.",1370304000,2013-06-04

I've tried sprays with some success, and the most effective device I have found is the motion-activated sprinkler - but both come with certain limitations so I am hopeful this works.A few observations at this point.  You put together these three piece ""poles"" that you stick in areas deer  frequent.  The poles are very cheaply constructed - and I worry how long they will last in the great outdoors. The idea here is that you coat cotton balls with a deer attractant - and when they stick their nose towards the balls they will get zapped by a slight electrical charge put out by two AA batteries.Interesting idea - and it makes some sense.  My concerns are that it is impossible to tell if it is working without getting a ""zap"" - and I assume I will have to continually put more attractant out.  So by the time I replace batteries and attractant I might be as well off to just use spray - but time will tell.",1304899200,2011-05-09

1.0,"Updated: Bummed! At time of first review, I loved this hose, but it turns out it is a fail. After less than three months of use, the cloth completely detached from the coupling that attaches to the faucet. Not repairable. Useless.Previous Review Title: Makes My Daily Watering Easier And QuickerMother's Day is the beginning of the outdoor growing period in our area of the Rocky Mountains. Once winter's passed and there is little chance of snow, we begin transforming our barren, uninviting, expansive wood deck into a our own little summer oasis.From out of the basement, we move the barbeque, patio furniture, awnings, umbrellas, a gazebo, a fountain and a chimenea to make the deck an attractive outdoor living space. Dozens of planters and flower pots get arranged in groupings on the deck and in multiple hanging baskets.The job of planting and maintaining the annual flowers is happily all mine. Every morning I water and joyfully watch hundreds of blooms proliferate as summer heats up. Two heavy 25' traditional garden hoses are attached together to make one long hose. The length is necessary to zig zag my way back and forth across one thousand square feet of deck. The hose is heavy. Sometimes I have to stop and use both hands to swing it up, over and/or around the furniture, etc.About a month ago I received the Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose. I'm never going use my old traditional type again. The Rumford weighs about two thirds less. It takes me much less time maneuvering it about, plus it delivers better pressure than my old hose.My Rumford Hose has not ripped despite me dragging it up, down, across and around everything on our wooden deck. As I swirl it to collapse inside our hose pot it naturally drains and is protected from direct sunlight. From what I've read in other reviews, that might be the reason my Rumford Hose hasn't ripped. My hose pot isn't available here, but it is very similar to this Liberty Garden Products 1913 Hammered Bell Garden Hose Pot - Copper.The Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose has made my daily routine tons easier and given me more time to enjoy my hard work.

3.0,"I thought this was such a neat idea at first glance - a ready-made herb and salad garden!  We live in a climate that gets below freezing for a few months every winter and it normally takes until late spring for anything to really get up to speed.  I had visions of planting these cute little pots in a sunny window and transplanting them outside when the weather was right.All in all, it's a neat kit, with fertilizer, seeds and a peat pot for each.  After removing the kit, you simply peel the label off the top, pick a nice spot and water.  Of the 18 seed pods, I had good results with 15 of them. Not bad odds really, and the ones that did sprout are doing pretty well right now.  It's a whole lot of packaging for 18 tiny pods though.  We've done starts before with peat pots from the garden store and had just as much luck with those.  I think if you used a soil with fertilizer, it might be better to start them that way at less than half and probably more like a quarter the price of this kit.  This saves getting your hands dirty digging in the soil bag, which really is most of the fun to me.All in all, it's a neat idea.  Peel a label, pop it in the ground, water and wait.  I think it'd make a great gift or a good starter for someone just dipping their toes into gardening.  If you're looking for an economical way to start a garden, however, I'd go with peat pots and a bag of soil from a local store.",1371168000,2013-06-14

5.0,"Having built a patio out back, I moved my grill out of the garage to store it outside. I bought theChar-Broil 65"" Artisan Grill Cover - Mountain Greenfor it when I bought the grill, but it was a little shorter than the grill, although it fit well otherwise. I decided to try the X-Large Classic Accessories 55-142-055101-EC Ravenna Grill Cover in taupe with myChar-Broil 4-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill, with Side burner.The Ravenna cover is plain, but still attractive. More importantly, it feels and looks very durable, which is exactly what I want to cover a grill outside. It is large enough that there is no part of the grill exposed to the elements, and the bottom tightens up to keep the fit snug. The Char-Broil cover had a tendency to blow half off of the grill when it was windy, but the Ravenna cover has stayed put even with the storms we've had here lately.I checked the grill after one storm subsided and found that the grill underneath the cover was still dry, even though it had poured for a couple of hours. VERY nice.There is a zipper pocket near the top of the cover. I haven't yet figured what to keep in it, but it is nice to have just in case. My favorite, however, is the handles it has on either end of the top.

4.0,"Ants can be a real nuisance.  When I see them swarming in the house, my natural reaction is to spray them with a diluted soap solution, which kills them almost immediately.Using a product like Terro Liquid Ant Killer, requires suppressing my ""kill immediately"" mindset and taking a long term approach.  The very best case scenario is that the foraging worker ants will consume the ant killer, and take it back to the colony, where it is consumed by the Queen ant.  When she dies, the colony will become crippled and die out.It sounds great in theory, and every species of ant I have encountered seems to love drinking the liquid.  It's very cool watching them maniacally feed, but how likely is it really that the poisonous solution will find its way back to her royal highness?  Probably, very, very, low.Many ant colonies are quite intensive, span large areas, can contain millions of ants, and some have several queens.  Believing that the few ants consuming the poison, will fortuitously also feed and kill the Queen, is quite a long shot.  Logically the more ants that drink the poison, the greater the odds of success.  So infecting as many ants as possible makes sense, but that's a little challenging with the product being sold in one or two ounce bottles, and administered by the drop.  It just doesn't seem very efficient, or provide the coverage to poison enough ants.I live in a temperate part of the country, and have four or five different species of ants constantly battling for territory in my yard.  They are basically everywhere there is soil.  Having used this product and similar liquid ant baits, many, many times, I have yet to see it wipe out a colony.The ingredients listed on the label are ""Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax) 5.4%"", and ""Other Ingredients: 94.6%"".  Assuming the costs are nominal for these ingredients, the percentage of profit on a product like this must be astronomical.  If liquid ant killer was sold by the pint instead of by the ounce, at a price closer to actual costs, with a more efficient system of distributing the poison (traps or other dispensers), I suspect the product would have a much higher rate of success.  But of course, that would be financial suicide for Terro, who make no promises regarding success.  Consider this, at the retail cost of $6.50 for two ounces, Terro Ant Killer costs about $416 per gallon (128 ounces).  At the price for the one ounce bottle ($4.25), a gallon costs $544.  This stuff is not cheap!I like to gamble, so I still use the product occasionally, with the hope that maybe just once I will get lucky and wipe out a colony.  Seeing the ants literally crawl over each other to guzzle down the stuff, feeds my fantasy that this will be the time the deadly elixir makes its way down through the depths of the colony, to the Queen's lips (sorry, mandibles), and she will meet a tragic end.Ant bait works.  What appears to be missing is some accurate data about how much liquid, and how many ants may need to be poisoned, to stand a good chance of taking out a colony.  If as I suspect, both numbers are quite substantial, that information probably won't be forthcomming from Terro anytime soon.",1282780800,2010-08-26

You may have to tighten them down from time to time to keep the wobble out! But, back to grilling! This is one nice little unit, burgers and steaks cook up quite nicely! The secret is knowing how to use the upper and lower vents for heat and smoke adjustments! Once you have that down, you can whip up some serious munch with this puppy! Have done some excellent k-bob's and burgers and steaks have come out just as nicely! Have used Webers hickory chips for smoked meats and the flavor was delicious!After each use, clean out ashes and you will have consistant bbq! Put a piece of aluminum foil in the ash pan to catch the ashes! Wrap it up and dispose of neatly. To  help season the upper and lower grills and get rid of that metal taste and smell, I placed the grills in my oven! Preheated to 325 degs. and baked for about an hour!

I think the instructions with the trap should be clearer as to baiting.  It needs to have bait to work and the instructions on the packaging do not make that glaringly apparent.  I am surprised they haven't come up with an electronic air freshener type of bait to go with this electronic trap.  I am using peanut butter but so far no mice.  Of course I haven't seen any mice in my other traps so I have to reserve judgment.  I will report back if any fried mice appear.  I have to go with four stars based on price.

I did not know exactly how this trap works before I chose it.  I have used many traps before, something I hate to do, but sometimes it is a must when you house gets over run by mice. I live in the woods and I have chickens and having them around will attract mice, I never knew that until last year.  I am against killing but when you find mice running across your living room rug and you dog catches one and the tail hanging from it's mouth you have to take action.Well that is what happened to me.  I found great a product but I am always open to anything that may be faster and fool proof.  That is why I ordered this, but it does not deliver.  I had a hard time getting it to work,  I kept thinking what was going to happen to this poor mouse. I did not know that this was not just a slam dunk and the animal was gone.  I would never have taken it if I had known that the manner of death was strangulation. While I tried to use it I had problems with it tripping while.  I think it was because I just cannot use this trap I do not think it is humane at all.There is not way this is going to strangle the poor mouse in an instant, it is not going to happen.

They are excellent at scooping up leaves or what you may have laying on the ground after trimming and deadheading.We found they truly excel when clearing away branches that are thorny or prickly, as when we cleared some barberry shrubs that had long outlived their decorative value.A very useful addition in the fight to tame the great outdoors and maintain curb appeal.Note: this item was provided for review purposes (but I'm buying some more as gifts for avid gardeners).",1400889600,2014-05-24
5.0,"This trap takes lots of abuse and just keeps working. Does better than others and doesn't need fancy bait. Our mild weather has brought out huge numbers of squirrels who are attacking my birdfeeders, chewing things in my potting shed and being very destructive. Because they have learned to jump onto the feeders from the deck railing it doesn't matter that I have a big raccoon baffle, in fact that seems to give the squirrels a nice place to stand while they dismantle the suet holder.  My feeders are squirrel proof but for one tray that encourages some bird types I like to watch but now I seem to be feeding more squirrels than birds.  This spring we've just been overrun and I knew I had to do something.I put the trap along the deck railing.  It is relatively narrow, although long, and fits on the railing with only about an inch of overhang.  I set it and then drop some birdseed in through the top beyond the trigger panel.  This is super easy bait and lasts even through rain storms.When a squirrel is trapped, the trap usually falls off the railing onto the ground below.  It stays shut and the squirrel can't get out.  Even after having this happen multiple times, the trap can still be reset and remains effective.  It is getting a little bent, but still works.I was given another (and more expensive) trap that was easier to set, but the mechanism rusted and it wouldn't spring shut.  This one sat out in the weather for a year before I started using it and it is still fully functional.",1338422400,2012-05-31

5.0,"Easy to install and discourages most small and large animals. There were a few pesky rabbits who figured it out and got to the lettuce. I guess it was too much temptation, and of course it won't keep the crows out of your corn. We had to make an adjustment to keep the rabbits from getting under it and hopefully that will work. I did not think it would keep the black bear we have around our mountain home out of the berry bushes, but so far he stays clear of it. Even a low impact zap on the nose may discourage him from trying to get to the blue berry bushes and fruit trees. Time will tell. We live in a huge wildlife area in the Blue Ridge Mountains so our garden and fruit bearing trees/bushes will give this product the ultimate test. I will comment with updates if it should fail to keep the animals out long term. So far it is doing a wonderful job.",1346716800,2012-09-04
3.0,"Please be aware of the fact that this Fly Trap is beyond Stinky.  Ideally you're going to want it far enough out that you don't smell it every time you walk out the door or sit outside but close enough that it'll be drawing the flies away.  If it were that easy and it worked then that'd be great.  My problem is that I don't notice very many flies being attracted to this thing and although I've seen a fly or two inside the trap, They seem to disappear.  We've had the trap up for over a month now.  I was hoping to notice a difference in our pesty flies but that hasn't been the case so far.I know when I've set traps out for gnats before that I've seen them go into my liquid and float.  30 minutes later I'll look and they'll be gone.  I realized then that the gnats were evidently dissolving.  Maybe that's what happening with the flies.  I'm not real sure.Since I'm not truly positive that this trap is actually doing anything, I would only give it 2 1/2 stars and I don't think I'd recommend it.",1372032000,2013-06-24

5.0,"I received my first Black & Decker corded lawn tool for Christmas about twelve years ago. I've been gas free ever since. I'll be the first to say that switching up to cordless products has had its moments. My only complaint with cordless B&D; lawn products is the battery life. The only reason besides my expanded B&D; lawn tool collection, that I stayed with these guys is the company's outstanding customer service. They are one of the very few companies that back up their products. The crew that mans B&D;'s toll free customer support number are simply outstanding. Moving on, after a two week test run these are my thoughts on the new B&D; LST 136.After a quick inventory, (trimmer, instructions, (1) 36v lithium battery, (1) string spool, three year warranty and a charger) I scanned over the easy to read instructions. Like my last two B&D; trimmers, all I needed was a philips head screwdriver to attach the debris shield. Out of the box, I charged the battery for about three hours. The battery is sweet. Its outfitted with an on board LED power usage meter. The charger is the typical basic no frills, no thrills B&D; charger. Unlike older models it only accepts 36 volt lithium batteries. Before getting started I sprayed the undercarriage and shield with a non stick cooking spray. This will definitely make clean up easier.Now for the test. Even with the battery I found this trimmer to be light weight. The handle has a good ergonomic feel to it. The trigger configuration hasn't changed. A big selling point for this model is the telescoping height extension. Adjustment is easy. Unlike earlier models, this trimmer is outfitted with a thumb dialed power control. From 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest), I was able to easily increase or decrease the head rotation. On the first week I chose the lowest setting (1) and was surprised that I was able to trim all of the front yard and half of the back yard area before I noticed a significant power drop off. I used my older trimmer to complete the job. A week later I trimmed the front yard first on the highest setting (6). I was barely able to finish the job before the battery was exhausted. I got maybe 15-20 minutes. A second battery would have helped the cause tremendously.The 13"" trim path is a definite step up from older models. Trimming wise, this model operates smoothly without any hiccups. It does a great job of getting under bushes and around the fence line. The metal guard for edging has stayed much the same design as the original model. Like my older B&D; trimmers, the LST 136 Trimmer does an okay job of edging but won't be replacing my electric edger any time soon. I think most users will agree, the auto line feed system is sweet. Its much nicer then the old bump and feed system. Spools can easily be changed out by using the side snaps on the cap head. On average I found myself using about four of the 30' line spools a year on my older trimmer. Only time will tell if that number drops with this new model. After each use, I clean the unit and coat the undercarriage with non stick cooking oil. Its a good idea to keep the line cutting blade oiled too. Like my other trimmers, I recommend sharpening the blade about once every three months.Overall, I'm quite impressed with the Black & Decker LST 136 trimmer. Its a powerful, quiet, gas free option that will get the job done. With proper maintenance it will last a long time. The only real shortcoming I find with this product, is that for larger yards more then one battery is needed. I do hope the folks at Black & Decker see the light. Still, this trimmer is a workhorse. I recommend it.",1339372800,2012-06-11

4.0,"This is a pricey solution - literally and figuratively - for people looking to rid their lawns and gardens of deer, rabbits, and other pesky critters. Part of the reason for that cost, however, is the inclusion of a surprisingly handy battery powered sprayer. Potential buyers might wonder if something like that is worth the extra cost, and I would say that for anybody with severe arthritis or other issues that make spraying or sprinkling this kind of product a painful exercise, the expense is worth it. The sprayer works very well, and it not only reduces the effort involved in spraying the repellent, it makes the job go a lot faster.

They were flipping over our traps and taking the bait without taking the punishment which wasn't working towards ridding us of our problem.

Sure enough, the first night they went for the bait station over the peanut butter trap. They ate about a sixth of the brick the first night, more the next night, and again for a few nights beyond that. I have no idea if it was the same mouse or multiple mice, but bottom line is- we have no more signs of mice and nothing is going for the bait anymore. I assume they made their way out of the house and died, because we have not found any signs or smells of dead mice inside the house. I really don't much care how it works, only that it works!

4.0,"Compared this to a very similarTaylor 9842 Commercial Waterproof Digital Thermometerthat we have.  Really, the only thing that the Taylor has over this one is the NSF certification, which can actually be pretty important.  This Gogodu does NOT state that it is NSF certified.  As far as temperatures, Gogogu and the NSF certified Taylor were always with 0.6 degrees (F) of each other.  However, NSF certifies not just the measurement, but also that the design meets the standards for being able to clean (from my vantage, this Gogogu is just as cleanable as the Taylor.)  The one thing that I can't vouch for is that NSF would have verified is that it is non-toxic, durable and resistant to corrosion.  Time will tell for the latter two, I'll just hope this sucker isn't toxic.So, from my ""layman's"" perspective on this thermometer, it's great...but having the NSF certification would have made it even nicer.  All in all, this appears to be a good all-around product.  Lastly, as far as being waterproof - both this one and my Taylor say they are waterproof.

5.0,"An Organic Approach To Weed Control!  Definitely A Safer Brand!I have used pre-emergent weed inhibitors for years, usually Preen.  As the father of four kids, I am always hesitant to put down chemicals on our lawn and yard, flower beds, etc. since the kids are often out there on the grass.While Preen is effective, I have never been crazy about adding ""yet another chemical"" to my landscaping.  The active ingredient in Preen is the synthetic herbicide trifluralin. Preen is fairly inexpensive.  Trifluralin is NOT safe for use around vegetables or other food plants/crops.  Also, trifluralin is harmful to fish and marine invertebrates, so if your property has water on it, or drains into ponds, rivers, etc. that is another consideration.So, I recently found out about Concern Weed Prevention Plus by Saferbrand.  Concern is made primarily of corn gluten. There are two versions:  the one being reviewed here, 100% corn gluten, and Plus for Lawn Care, which is corn gluten meal (82%), nitrogen (8%), phosphate (2%) and potash (4%).  These can be used on lawns, around shrubs and flowers, and there are none of the same concerns as when you use trifluralin.  In fact, after using Concern Weed Prevention Plus, your kids can go right out on the lawn. Corn gluten IS safe to use around vegetables and crops. If you do put it on small plants, you want them to be 3 or 4 inches tall, so it doesn't hurt them.Trifluralin and corn gluten provide similar results, by stopping pre-emergent weeds, but they work in different ways.  Trifluralin inhibits cell division.  Corn gluten creates a film layer on soil which impedes weeds from sprouting.  Neither should be used on plants smaller than 3"" or so.The Concern product is a little more expensive than Preen (about 68 cents more per pound, as of this writing), but to me that is a small price to pay for a more organic solution.I used Concern Weed Prevention Plus on my shrub and flower beds this past week.  I checked my soil temperature to ensure it was about 55 degrees, and then applied as directed.  Concern Weed Prevention Plus comes in several sizes.  I use the 5 pound bags.  Although I have enough bedding to require a few bags, I find it more convenient.  Were I to use it on my lawn, I would purchase the larger bags.The 5 pound bag indicates it will cover about 250 square feet.As warmer weather approaches in my area of New Jersey, my friends the dandelions and crabgrass will soon come to visit.  I will update this review to note the effectiveness of the product.Something to keep in mind: NO product eliminates 100% of weeds in the first season, unless you are dealing with a very small area of application.  If you apply periodically, you will control 80-90%, and over a couple of seasons, probably eliminate almost 100% of your weeds.I would rate this product highly, as it provides the same benefits as other chemical solutions, with no real downside.",1364860800,2013-04-02
4.0,"Miracle-Gro leaf shine adds shine to the leaves of your houseplants instantly. It's not a necessary product and doesn't provide any nutrients for you plant like you might think since it's from Miracle-Gro but it does make them look healthier.Houseplants with large leaves need to be cleaned and dusted anyway so it's easy to use the Miracle-Gro leaf shine while you're doing it. You can spray the product directly onto the leaves but to avoid overspray, it is easier just to spray it onto a cloth and wipe the leave with the cloth.",1400716800,2014-05-22
3.0,"Overall this is a pretty good product but it has some issues, especially at this price point.1) It just barely has enough light for a three burner Weber 320. For $25 I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the thing to light up my grill clearly. I can see why so many people here have installed two of them on their grills but then that's $50 just for flashlights! Weber should have at least two more LED's on this puppy so one unit is enough even if that means $10 more on the price.2) The instructions are horrid. I am usually very good with cryptic instructions but it took quite a bit of fooling around for me to determine that I needed to ignore what the instructions appeared to say and use brackets A1 and A2 to mount on my Weber 320.3) If you don't turn off the light it says in semi-on mode until your battery dies. Stupid plan. When the lid is down it should go all the way off, and when the lid is up it should turn on; it shouldn't even have a power button for water to get inside. I think the semi-on mode is so you can find it in the dark, but I still say it is a bad design. That or they should have added a small LED on the front to let you easily see when it is powered on from a distance.All that said, once installed it does work okay and it looks good. The auto on/off when you move the lid is a nice touch and the way it mounts it stays out of the way when the lid is closed so you can put a cover on your grill without an issue.The minimal light is my major gripe and if you have a grill with 4 or more burners you may as well just buy two of these from the get go as I may even end up buying a second one with my three burner grill...",1369699200,2013-05-28
5.0,"I was impressed with the weight, quality, features, and appearance of this Loveseat cover.  It is a very heavy material.  The stitching is durable and well finished.  The ties which hold the cover to each of my four loveseat legs are sturdy plastic slips and there is an adjustable elastic band, more like a long bungee cord, sewn all the way around the bottom.  Once attached this cover isn't blowing away unless the sofa it's covering goes with it.But here's that secret I was talking about.  Our patio furniture consists of a 2-3 person loveseat and two chairs.  That's a total of four bottom cushions and four back cushions.  If this cover was at all decent, and it exceeds decent by a long shot, I planned on getting a pair of covers for our chairs.  What I discovered, though, was that this is large enough so I can put all the cushions on the loveseat and still cover everything securely and completely.My advice is that you will not be disappointed with this cover.  I've had other covers in the past that were slightly less expensive and nowhere near as good.  And, if you think you might need covers for chairs with cushions as well get this first and maybe it will be all you'll need too.",1375228800,2013-07-31

5.0,"These little bait chunks are nice for your MOUSE problem, but the design not only keeps pets out, it'll keep larger pests, like rats, out as well. They're easy to load, the bait is tried-and-true. 5 stars for what they are, just don't confuse these for rat traps because only baby rats will be able to get into this to reach the bait.",1405382400,2014-07-15
5.0,"Every fall, we share our property with about a million leaves. Our town doesn't have one of those leaf vacuums to pick up leaves at the curb but they do drive a truck around to pick up bags of autumn's largess. That means we have to pick them up and get them to the street. We usual use a shovel and our hands to pack the bags but when I saw this &#34;stomper&#34; I pounced. What a clever idea. It attaches easily to the end of our rake and does a good job compressing / packing the leaves so we actually use fewer bags. That's both an economical issue and a practical one. Obviously, the fewer bags you use, the less you have to spend buying them plus, the fewer bags you pile up at the curb, the less work you have to do hauling them to the street. Throw in that dozens of bags in front of the house is unsightly so the fewer bags out there the better.Overall, it does exactly what it says it will do and the humorous shape of the stomper (a foot) is just plain fun.We like it - recommended if you have to bag leaves.",1387411200,2013-12-19
5.0,"We have multiple bird-feeders for various species in the back yard, including two hummingbird feeders. Since my neighbor also maintains hummingbird feeders we have LOTS of birds coming in. This particular feeder has worked out great due to its thoughtful design.First, the reservoir is large enough to last for two days. (You don't want to go too long without changing the sugar water because it will cloud and ferment.)Second, this is an incredibly easy feeder to clean. I can take this feeder down, scrub it out, rinse and refill it in less than five minutes.Third, the ""ant trap"" on the lid, (a small ring/water reservoir), gets added to by any rain we get. Additionally, I see other bird species actually drinking the water from the ant reservoir which is okay since we don't have a significant ant problem anyway.In summary, this feeder gets my highest recommendation. If you are a more casual feeder of the birds, you might wish to get the feeder from the same company which has the smaller reservoir.",1371686400,2013-06-20
5.0,"This is such a pretty hummingbird feeder. The copper metallic part with the metal flower accents is so much classier than the red plastic feeders out there. The birds love it. I just watched two fighting over it. Since there are four feeding stations, you'd think they could share, but I guess not.What I liked: The design is attractive. The glass bottle is a perfect size. Other products have a larger bottle, but the liquid goes bad before the birds use it up. This one, I can fill half full and then clean it out every week without wasting much nectar. The bottle is sturdy glass and pretty in design. It's easy to disassemble for cleaning. When you unscrew the bottle, the bottom two layers separate, so there is no prying to try to get them apart. Much easier to keep clean for the health of the birds. No leaking or dripping of nectar, which is super. Some models have issues.What I didn't like: It's hard for me to find something I don't like, but I'll say that the bottom part is plastic. I assume it will hold up well, but since the reservoir is glass and the top part is metal, why not make the whole thing metal? Perhaps it's to prevent rust, but the listing describes this as metal and glass (overlooked the plastic part). One other nice perk would be to include a package of nectar to get the buyer started, or to include a recipe on the tag for nectar. I make mine from a recipe I found online for 4 parts water and 1 part sugar (boiled and cooled).I received this one for review, but I'd definitely purchase more!",1339545600,2012-06-13
4.0,"I made a mistake ordering this in July, but I was able to plant some now and save the rest for the spring time.The seed selection is diverse, but not practical for a kit that only produces so few plants. The amount of lettuce and spinach are too small and will only net a couple of salads, if they are carefully tended. The herbs are fine with one plant each, and will season a lot of meals. The tomatoes will provide a fair amount of tomatoes, but most families need several tomato plants. The bean plant will probably make one pot of beans. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the picture.On the positive side, the seed pods make it very easy to grow garden plants. It would not be feasible for most people to buy enough of these pods to plant a regular size garden, but it's a nice kit for a patio garden. It would also make a perfect garden for a child that has their own little spot to grow it.I decided to grow the lettuce pods in an indoor windowsill garden. It's too hot outside this time of year to put them outdoors, but the temperature is perfect where they are and they get plenty of sunlight. They have already popped up and we're looking forward to seeing how they do. I also just started the herb plants, since I can also grow them indoors later, but they are fine outdoors right now.The Miracle Grow Gro-ables are an interesting starter for inexperienced gardeners or children. There are a lot of limitations with this set, but it does have it's merits. I would recommend this kit to the complete novice or for kids, but would not recommend it to my experienced gardening friends.",1376092800,2013-08-10

4.0,"I've had this sweeper for a couple of weeks. It's quite small and compact and doesn't weigh much at all. The battery is quite small and lightweight if you're used to the old B&D; batteries from a few years ago.One of the nice thing I noticed straightaway is that  the sweeper has have a test button with LEDS that show you how full the charge currently is.The other nice thing is that the battery does not discharge noticeably when left unattended so you're not going to be left stranded so long as you charge it after use. The charger itself is simple and quite bulky compared to the rest of the kit. It does a good job and charges in a short time. My battery was already half charged when I received it and I was up and running in less than 20 minutes.Constructing the sweeper and vacuum nozzles from the multiple parts that come in the box was simple but required some muscle to slot together. Probably a good thing since you don't want it coming loose and wobbling and probably means you'll never to dismantle either again. All the parts that have to be disconnected and reconnected have nice lock switches that are smooth and easy to use and let you switch between the sweeper and vacuum with ease.SWEEPINGI first used the sweeper on the large patio at the back of the house and the driveway. The sweeper has a dial that lets you set the power between 1 and 6 with 1 using the least power. I found that the nozzle is thinner than my wired Ryobi blower and does an excellent job on hard surfaces like the patio and driveway. I also tried it on the lawn and had to turn it up to between 4 and 6. Then blowing mostly dry leaves on 2"" grass was ok but the battery drains significantly faster. Since it specifies that the blower is really for hard surfaces, this is what it does very well.VACUUMThe collector bag is easy to attach and smaller than I expected after my Ryobi. After seeing the power of the blower I wasn't expecting too much in the sucking of debris since it tends to get damp and clump together more. I was pleasantly surprised. It sucked up dry leaves and dead rhododendron flowers that had fallen on the patio with ease. It performed better than anticipated but got blocked quite frequently if you were overambitious. This is partly due to the thinner opening. I noticed that it actually jammed less when you ran it on a lower power level where it sucks up leaves more slowly in layers rather than all at once.Whilst converting it to vacuum from sweeper I noticed that it has a plastic impeller blade for blowing and chomping up waste. I would have preferred something a bit more hardy like the magnesium one in my wired blower.CONCLUSIONThis is a nice light-weight blower that can easily be held in one hand with little strain. It is far lighter than my wired one which requires both hands and wears you out after a few minutes. The battery is light and charges quickly and is easy to test with the click of a button. It performs very well on hard surfaces at the lowest setting and is FAR more convenient than my wired one which I will probably only use in the fall. For light use around the patio, garage, driveway and pavement outside the front of the house this is a great tool.Vacuum is only ok, but works if you have the patience for it. It shreds everything that passes through it into a finer mulch that takes up less space in the garden waste can. So if you really need it, it does work so long as you don't expect to suck up big piles of wet leaves that have been standing around a while.In short, this is a light- to medium-duty tool that will last a good 20 minutes at more conservative settings between 1 and 4.",1364947200,2013-04-03

3.0,"When I was planting these my housekeeper was around and she took a look at the packages and said, ""Okay, but why?"" She was wondering, like I was wondering, why putting the seeds into a little container which you then have to plant, is better than just putting the seeds into the ground (which is what we usually do on our 1+ acre of garden).Well, after planting the pods, and then re-planting them every couple of days for the last few weeks (after they were dug up by a succession of beasts: the neighbor's cats, ground squirrels, raccoons, and skunks) I've come to the conclusion that they are best planted in pots. Why? Because the ones I planted in pots are the only ones that don't seem to get dug up and also are sprouting the best (probably a result of not being dug up every couple of days).Anyhow, there is a lot of sprouting going on, and I think these would be fun with a kid, or for a beginning gardener, because you won't lose track of the seeds. Also, there are granules of Miracle Gro inside the little pods, so there is ample fertilizer for the seeds.I know that many people won't have the pests that I described above, so perhaps these pods will be an awesomely simple way to plant their garden.Overall, I'm just glad that corporations are trying to make home gardening easier for beginners. If you're new to the whole world of gardening this is probably a nice way to start, with a good selection of seeds. You might want to know your growing zone, as the tomatoes would never bear fruit from a seed in the zone 4/5 area where we live, unless you had a greenhouse to house starts.",1376611200,2013-08-16

I tried it around my backyard about 50 feet and it actually worked better. I think the deer get smart after awhile and go around it. The babies run one to three but the parents will try try again.

5.0,"I have a deep man-made fish pond in my back yard and have been looking to add a fountain that wouldn't require a lot of rewiring effort and could be done in a few minutes. TheVicTsing 1.4 W Floating Solar Fountain Pumpis an outstanding solution, featuring solar power and easy to put together parts.This unit is just over 6.5"" in diameter and goes together quickly. This fountain features 3 (three) different heads to give you variety and options, finding the spray that best meets your tastes and wishes.I took the unit outside to get it setup and it turned on immediately.  I turned it away from the sun until I got to the pond.  I slid the fountain into the pond and it began functioning nicely.  I tested each of the three (3) heads to find the one I liked best; of the different heads, the height varied around 1' up to 1' 6"".  Speed and power was varied on sunlight and the particular head I selected.  Being solar dependent, the unit will drop pressure and eventually turn off in shade; it has no battery inside, but then you won't have to change batteries, so that's a good thing.There are so many great uses for theVicTsing 1.4 W Floating Solar Fountain Pump.  This could be fun to add a little flare at a pool party, or to keep the water fresh in a bird bath or pond.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.
