5.0,"Good location to highway- easy to get around if you leave before 6am. The breakfast made my day, and the coffee is worth taking a to go cup. People are always at the pool- which is family oriented. The staff is helpful and they have cookies in the evenings.",2016-07-09
4.0,"The staff at this Comfort Inn is wonderful. They are always very accommodating with us and help us out. We've stayed here more than once but always in room 201. It's a very nice room, it's clean, and the beds are comfortable. The included breakfast is quite good for a free breakfast and my nieces love the waffles! My nieces also love their pool! It's pretty average size for a hotel but big enough for us. Marzoni's is just across the parking lot which is great for us because it is our favorite restaurant in the Altoona area.",2016-06-04
4.0,"A standard not fancy hotel that provides a little privacy and extra space at a good rate if you want an affordable suite. Decent pretty big breakfast buffet (could someone figure out that 15 of us don't digest dairy and really like having something like soy or almond milk). little pool only good for kids. Nice big lobby and lounge areas.Jesse L,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

3.0,"My husband and I stayed at this motel for a night away without the kids. We were looking for something relatively cheap near the Little River Casino and only paid 99 for the room.

1.0,"I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again.",2013-04-09
5.0,"I was here with my teenaged son. We enjoyed our stay at this quiet, well-maintained hotel in a residential part of Santa Barbara just a short walk from the mission, and a short walk from downtown.

5.0,I am always pleased with my time at a Hampton Inn. I stay for business but would recommend the Hampton Inns for anyone traveling for any reason. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff is extremely caring and friendly. Locations are good and I find that Hampton Inns are consistent with their service and quality wherever they are.,2016-01-16
5.0,We picked this hotel for price and location - it's a quick drive to the MFAH and walking distance from the George Brown Convention Center. We had a number of restaurants (mostly chains) and bars within walking distance to choose from. The hotel itself was exactly what we wanted - clean and well staffed. We'd happily stay there again.,2016-06-17

3.0,"I stayed for one night on my way to Indiana. Let's just say that you get what you pay for. It's was an ok stay. The room was kinda small, it needed several touch ups on the furniture/bathroom fixtures, the pillows were not good for the neck, and the bathroom was tiny. The good things were that the customer service was good and it was a nice location for exploring around town.",2016-06-16

Will stay here again - this was our second visit in 5 years to the same hotel. Spacious suites. Nice large flat panel televisions - 2 per suite. Workout room adequate. We had a dead battery in the hotel garage and the guest services attendant helped us find a car service employee who assisted us for no charge! Only suggestion - bathrooms need exhaust fans!

Secondly the rooms are set not to allow the AC to lower below 70 that made the room uncomfortable and third we where in the room for three days and the minibar wasn't re-stocked or was the sugars for the coffee maker or tea, it looks like only one elevator was working and it took forever!",2016-10-01

3.0,"The location of this hotel was amazing and the price was right. Unfortunately, it was a weekend and the hotel was hosting a wedding. As a result, it was very loud. I was assured by the staff that it would end around 10:30, but the party was yelling and slamming doors until at least 11:30. There was a note in my room to respect quiet time from 10p-6a, but I guess that applied only to me. I had an early morning event to attend, so I wouldn't recommend staying here on a weekend if you intend to get any rest. Also, my room had a shared bath, which was very poorly treated by whomever else was sharing it. Be advised that sometimes other guests might not be as civilized as you are.",2015-10-10
3.0,"Rooms are clean with basic amenities, but very dated. Beds are comfortable, rooms are fairly quiet, but can definitely hear through the walls. Breakfast is very basic, but fresh.

5.0,"I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team. I am glad the our larger rooms and knowledgeable staff made your stay great. We hope to see you soon weather it be for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Jonathan",2017-10-19

2.7,"Bad: I didn't care for the fact that we had to keep asking for the simple things such as, towels, sheets, glasses. Had to have them clean the tub before we even step foot in it because it was black at the bottom. Had to request that the garbage be emptied. Maintenance was called twice, once for the toilet and another because the air conditioning wasn't working. I would think for a hotel that charges you IN FULL for your stay before you leave the check in counter would be on top of things making their guests happier. Good: The view and location of the hotel was perfect and breakfast was nice except for the juices... The hotel outdoor pool was nice but the bar wasn't fully stocked and the food was HORRIBLE.",2016-09-03
3.0,"The hotel is a bit shabby and needs updating. Outdoor pool was decent, but the pool furniture was falling apart, and there was very little of it. On the sides of the pool, was a ton of trash, garbage, debris, and an old mattress propped up behind the dumpster. They really should see these things and clean it up. The room was like a small suite, with a new flat screen. The couch however was filthy. The couches in the rooms that I saw when doors were open, all need cleaned big time. Bed was OK, comfortable enough. I asked for an unstained comforter when I got there extra pillows, and my requests were pleasantly handled right away. I must say, the staff were all very nice. Maids forgot to replenish the coffee in the room, and I had to go for it 3 times. But they were always nice and brought anything we needed. It would never be my first choice in Beaufort, but not my last, either. They just need to pay attention to DEEPER cleaning and updating. Well-intentioned OK for a night or two.",2015-09-30

2.0,"Upon check in our room was not ready. It was a non-smoking room, yet guests prior to us had been smoking inside the room. There was a cigarette butt in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. There was an inch between the outside door and the wall allowing bugs inside of the room. There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist. The day of check out my daughter had hit her toe on the concrete car stop, causing us to go into the ER. The hotel overall was loud and dirty. Upkeep was poor. Poor lighting.

The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast.

5.0,"I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast.",2012-09-02

Don't come here expecting frills and fancy decor. And what's wrong with eating breakfast at Dennys We used the coupons and our breakfast cost about 2 plus tip. If you are here to tour the wine country there are probably better places to stay. If you are just looking for a place in Napa to spend a night or two please give this place your consideration. We arrived here on our way to Sonoma County and needed a place to stay for 1 night. The Best Western suited our needs. Our room was clean and the furniture was in good shape.

5.0,"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel.

Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off.

It is the last stop on the metro which at first we thought was a bad thing but ended up being good since we always had a seat in the morning on the way to D.C.

3.0,"We stayed here for a trip to Disneyland. The good: 1 bedroom suite was very large. The bedroom area was small but the living area was huge. Great working/desk area and very nice kitchenette with a nearly full sized refrigerator, small stove, microwave, etc. Some things were recently renovated and looked very nice. The staff was great, helpful and friendly. Location was great, lots of stuff nearby, on the ART route to Disney and close to freeways. Breakfast was small but a decent selection - the waffles were really good and they had trays so that you could take food back to your room. The bad: some parts of the hotel have not been renovated, so there is a mix of new/nice and old/run down in the same room (i.e bathroom counters were nice, but the rest of the bathroom was dated. Old dresser in the bedroom, but tv's were nicer. The carpeting was old, and the door to the room was worn and actually had some non matching paint spots covering some type of damage, but the kitchenette was very nice as was the desk area and newer cabinets that were part of the desk area. For having a large living space, there wasn't a lot of seating. So, there was a small sofabed, and a table with just one chair. It would be nice to have the table and 4 chairs so that if multiple people are in the room (a standard family) there would be places to sit as the couch would only really fit 2-3 people. the other bad was that while I booked the room using Marriott points and was told that they would only place a 40 hold for incidentals on my credit card, the system automatically puts a hold for 170 for each night of your stay, unless the clerk removes your card info and overrides the system. I didn't know this until i looked online at my credit card account. Fortunately, Sam at the front desk was great and got the hold for the first night removed and made sure that no hold was placed on the 2nd night. Still though, unsettling to have some unexpected holds on your account. I've never had that happen at any other marriott property. I also had trouble connecting to the wifi, it kept giving me an error that I couldn't log into the wifi with my room number and last name. But, it actually still connected me on all devices I tried, so I just ignored the error and it worked just fine.Martha C.Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate.

The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to. The surrounding area leaves something to be desired. In the end, it was not terrible, but it was not great either.",2011-03-03

Not fancy but comfortable and clean.There's no breakfast included, which is not a good point, but there are several restaurants nearby (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and others). The hotel is also close to several train stations.Wifi works well in the bedroom. The fees are not so cheap, but for that location all hotels use to be expensive, so I'd say this one offers a good cost-benefit ratio.In general it was a good experience and I'd stay there again in the future.Dear Camila LThank you very much for the review of your recent stay with us at The Central Loop HotelI am delighted that we were able to offer you good value for money and you were able to enjoy all the amenities that we offer and appreciated our great location from which to get out and see the city.I was especially delighted to read about the service we offered you - we know that these small things make all the difference.

4.0,"We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable.

Lastly, I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work, but after the episode with the door I decided it wasn't worth asking.

5.0,"We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time.

After we settled in for the evening, one of the neighboring rooms occupants were having an argument. They proceeded to slam their door and yell in the hallway on and off for 30 minutes. They were loud enough to wake my husband over the television. When we left our room the next morning, the hallway reeked of marijuana and cheap air freshener. We were getting an early start on our traveling and even though the hotel offered a continental breakfast, nothing was available (not even coffee) before 7:00 am.",2015-03-03

However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided.

We had an incident were our youngest got sick in the car, the front desk went out of their way to help, and within minutes helped me make an appointment for cleaning. They also recommended touring, although the touring company turned out to be a disaster! The downed elevator was a bit annoying. We read in a review that there was a cockroach in one of the rooms, and it was too bad that we also saw a quarter sized one in the breakfast area! We quickly told the kids it was a beetle.

5.0,"Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me.",2015-07-07
2.0,"Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for.",2016-01-08

The internet did not work in the room or the lobby on any of our devices, ipod, ipad, laptop, nothing. Did use the computer in the business center. They advertise a breakfast buffet in the lounge but it wasn't represented well with that title. Consisted of eggs, waffle (premade), cereal, toast so I was a little disappointed. The shuttle picked us up at the Metro 15 minutes late after I called twice. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and the room was clean.",2012-08-09

We ate at the Quarter Deck restaurant he recommended all three days we were there for lunch it was so good. Cant say enough good things about the Virginian Suites!!!

We first found out about this not having water in the toilet, That was eventually rectified but we did not have any hot water. After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did. They failed to understand that a hot water issue was a hotel problem not a City of Baltimore.",2014-01-31
3.0,"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team",2017-01-07

The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good.

Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range.

The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here.

2.0,"We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money!

The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington.",2004-11-01

1.0,"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",2018-03-18

All motels in Sunnyvale are expensive compared to similar places elsewhere so we have to factor that in to the price. I have stayed twice recently. All the rooms are not equal. The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable.

And as they have wedding parties every weekend you have to suffer noise and disruption from wedding guests staying in the hotel. Up until 5am at times. No sleep for me. Smoking and drinking outside the front lobby, and no one to stop them until I phoned at 2am to complain. Where is the noise coming from , I was asked Right in front of you , I said. They need to MANAGE this. Not put non wedding guests on floors with guests, and they should put polite notices up about noise.

Recently renovated, very comfortable and clean beds, modern furnishings (LCD TVs), granite counter tops in bathrooms. Good price too! Taking the bus from New York City to the hotel takes only 15 minutes. The commute in can be a little longer, up to an hour, so leave lots of extra time traveling into NYC.

3.0,"This hotel is fine. The room was nice and the lobby clean. The buffet was good. My problem is you pay a premium for this hotel due to the location and it really isnt' worth the money., in my opinion. Stay at a hotel farther out and take the public transport system. Our one night stay for a basic room with a king bed was 345. Also, they give you ear plugs on your nightstand. Not a good sign. Bring a noise maker to drown out the noise.Dear TinasB3116Mo,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and sorry to hear that you felt the cost did not match the experience of being at the heart of Seattle across the street from Space Needle. Our prices do very through out the year and often are much lower. Also if you are a World of Hyatt member and book directly with Hyatt.com you can save an additional 10 off.I hope you do keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to host you again! Most Sincerely,Jonathan",2017-07-20

5.0,"I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for one week and enjoyed my stayed. One thing that I was really disappointed with was the room service they did not do a good job at cleaning the room. Out of the 5 days that I stayed there, I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day. I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom. I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review.",2016-02-28

The kids loved the pool and the breakfast was very nice. They let you in the breakfast area all day which is very nice for late night snacks for the kids and drinks for the adults. The shuttle to the metro station to catch the subway into DC was very nice and they pick you up as well. I know some folks complain that the last pick up is at 9 pm, but since the DC mall exhibits close at 6 pm it was not a problem. Due to the price of the metro I would recommend the travel time to start on or after 9:30 am",2017-08-23

Front desk staff was rude, said I did not reserve with charge card and was ready to give my room away - I insisted she check records. she then admitted she was wrong and the room was already paid for. Upon arrival, nobody at the front desk - had to wait. understaffed for such a busy night. once in our room, discovered they gave us a king bed for 3 adults - had to go track down a cot since there was no other room to switch to. staff was short with me and my family. said we should have known to call the front desk when making the reservation, etc. etc - pretty much blaming us for not doing a better job with making reservations. Hotel is in decline with repairs needed (broken door locks, broken gym equipment, broken machine in breakfast area, clogged toilet, broken clock in gym, filter not working in pool adequately, etc.) Housekeeping had rooms clean, but common areas needed more attention. Towels in gym and pool area were low in stock. staff in breakfast area was very attentive and pleasant. Seems more staffing/attention to detail would generally bring things back up to snuff. It is close to traffic - and right next to a fire station. Ask for a room in the back if you can!",2014-06-14

I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day.

2.0,"I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review.",2012-10-11

Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late.

No big deal. 2nd time was on Monday morning, about 9:30-10AM, someone opened our door without knocking, noticed we were in there and left.

In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again.",2009-10-21

5.0,"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.",2007-05-25

We were checked in by a pleasant and helpful clerk. The room was clean and quiet with a microwave oven, refrigerator, a large TV, and free WiFi. We used the laundry and fitness room facilities which were modern and clean. One of us chose the standard breakfast (coffee or tea, two eggs, sausage or bacon, toast or hash browns), offered at the Denny's next door, which was free. The other got 5 toward one of the other breakfasts offered on the menu. Both were satisfactory.

I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted.

4.0,"Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you back soon.",2015-11-21

The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair.

I have to agree with most of the reviews the service was outstanding, the breakfast was awesome and the fitness center was clean and spacious. The website does show a pool, however it does not exist so we brought our suits for nothing. Our room was clean, updated and repaired, but the evidence of previous extensive water damage could still be noticed.

There were a lot of mirrors, and the kitchenette allowed for a second sink and counter top to get ready. We were on the second floor, so the noise from the street was pretty loud, but not to the point where it kept either of us up all night. The breakfast is a pseudo-hot breakfast... no eggs or meat but it did have a waffle maker. Location is perfect, but at night it gets loud and rowdy, and there was some police activity just a block down (nothing bad, just drunken party goers). I would definitely stay here again.",2014-07-30

However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed.

While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had.

They provided them, but the remote still wouldn't turn the TV on. Finally, after tapping the remote on the table, it started working. The room condition was good, and the beds were comfortable.

Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe.

Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live.

3.75,"Bad: Breakfast, though a big step up from the basic continental breakfast, was a little disappointing. The hot option was a choice of three different flatbreads that you can toast yourself. Also, it's only served from 6AM-9AM, fine for business travelers but a bit early for our weekend visit. Good: The hotel seems to cater to long-stay visitors, so the room was set up like a small apartment with couch, TV, desk, and well-equipped kitchen area with a full-sized fridge, plates and silverware, microwave, and dishwasher.

There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants.

4.0,"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home.",2017-09-05

The 4-star rating is for the staff and extra's. They have nice amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, small fitness room, but very nice and accommodating hot breakfast (free) AND free Happy Hour with 3 drinks each AND hot and cold appetizer buffet, which was enough to eat as dinner. There was nice green, tossed ( fresh) salad, soup, chili, hot dog bar, nacho bar, Italian pasta, chicken fingers, cheese, fruit, and one to two other items I do not remember.

It was convenient having those options on-site, as I had driven far to get there, and didn't want to have to get back in the car to find a place to eat. My only complaint is that the hotel is valet-only, which results in unexpected expenses because I felt obligated to tip the valet drivers each time, but that's not a huge deal.",2016-10-11

On our third day, when we arrived back from the beach around 3PM our key cards would not open our door.

I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities.

The staff was very accomodating and supported any requests that we made. PArticularly when we needed an extra night and they were oversold. Aric was a gem constantly checking on how we were doing when he saw us on the property and assisting with some printing needs when the lobby printer was tied up and I needed to get some things mailed ASAP. I definately recommend this hotel if you are going to Disney or looking to attend an Angels game.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you so much for your wonderful review.

4.0,"I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP.",2013-05-18

5.0,"My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!",2016-11-06

Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor.

3.0,"HOTEL STAYThe company I work for is located in San Francisco. Last week I was sent down to the Anaheim office for 2 1/2 days from Wednesday to Friday. During my business trip last week I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Originally my boss tried to book my reservation at Ayres Hotel, which according to him was about 220 yards away from the office. However the second night was fully booked. The last minute my boss booked the other closest hotel, which is TownePlace Suites Anaheim. According to Google Maps the location of this hotel is about a 10 minute walk. I've walk from this hotel to the office. The walking time was a lot less then 10 minutes. I cannot compare this hotel to Ayres Hotel at the moment. However this hotel is not only close to the Anaheim office but also is situated with a lot of nice restaurants that are one block away. The room I stayed in was a studio suite, which included a kitchen. There was decent space inside the room unlike most hotel rooms as this room had a couch and kitchen. Twice at night around 9PM I swam at the swimming pool and sat in the whirlpool. The swimming pool was slightly heated while the whirlpool was really heated. Going to the swimming area helped me relax from that day's work. The one main knock I would say is the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast is buffet style with pastry, bread, coffee, eggs, and sausage. Both times I've had breakfast the eggs were overcooked and the sausage was cold. I don't mind if the complimentary breakfast was only pastry and coffee. However if there is hot, cooked food on the complimentary breakfast then items such as fried eggs and sausages shouldn't be stale. Overall I enjoyed my two nights at this hotel during my business trip.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It wastruly a pleasure to serve you.We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared withthe hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional serviceto guests like you.Thank you for staying at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium and we hope you choose to create more memories withus whenever your travels bring you back to Anaheim.Sincerely,Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager edgar.riveramarriott.com",2017-12-31

The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom.

We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue.

Then after she was off and I stood there for few minutes she said can i help you. I said we are checking in, She said that the other attendant will help me!! Finally checked in, Room was ok, Nothing spectacular although the mirror was so clean my wife thought there was another room. lol Biggest downfall was that there seemed to be a lot of coming and going late at night/early morning.

4.0,"We enjoyed our stay at this establishment. The king size room was very comfortable, the bedding and mattress type in particular. One aspect of the room that I thoroughly appreciated was the ability to control the climate. In many hotels the thermostats are locked out at a certain temperature depending upon the time of the year. At this hotel you could control the cool air or heat at your discretion (major kudos...). Unfortunately a complaint was lodged with housekeeping because a specific request was made to have the sheets changed (on second day of 3 night stay), and although the request was eagerly granted, the bed linen was not changed. Upon a late return to the hotel we made another request to have the bed linen changed. The service desk accommodated us as best as they could (at 1130p) but our sheets did not get changed until 1245a when the overnight attendant came on duty. This all could have been avoided had the housekeeping receptionist paid actual attention to my request instead of merely giving me lip service. The hotel manager took excellent steps in addressing my concerns. I would definitely stay at this hotel upon future travel. Thank You!",2008-06-12
5.0,"Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger.

2.0,"First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.",2007-08-01

But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place.,2016-01-07
5.0,Close to the river with shops and restaurants. Uber/taxi over and enjoy yourself for the night. They used to have a great full breakfast included but now it costs 16-bummer. Staff is helpful and polite. You are 10 minutes to downtown Napa.,2018-06-18
1.0,"Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again.",2014-11-18

I probably should have requested a new room, but by then I had my toiletries unpacked and didn't feel like moving. I was tired, so I slept through the noise, no problem. My second night I asked for a different room - the AC was still noisy, must just be 'normal'. The halls smelled a little musty, but the shining light of the stay was the front desk and housekeeping personnel. I had forgotten an expensive temperpedic pillow in my first room that I take with me when I travel. I didn't notice that I didn't have it until I was ready to go to bed the 2nd night (in a different room). The front desk people were very attentive, but housekeeping had gone home for the night or something and the front desk didn't have the key to their storage room....SO, I had to wait until I checked out the next morning to get me pillow back. But I DID get my beloved pillow back, so, all's well that ends well.",2015-09-24

3.0,"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted.

Great breakfast with lots of variety. Nice to have the shuttle even though there were limited times. We took it when we could other wise just used uber which was not really a problem for us. The room also had a little fridge and microwave which was great for storing and having snacks.,2017-02-01

3.0,"The hotel staff are super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast is also very good. Apart from the usual cold fare, the hot part included scrambled egg, home fries, and one other item (bacon or sausage or biscuit/gravy) during our stay. But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",2014-04-09

Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins!

3.0,"Every night when we came back to the hotel, numerous spots were open. We were delighted. Until we figured out why. It appears that someone designing the spaces are attempting to put as many as possible there, so the spots are very narrow. Even in a midsize car, you cannot park in many of the spots, because someone has parked over the lines, because the spaces are too small. It's like a domino effect. So you can't park unless you want someone dinging your car door. Because of this, we had to find parking very far away from our room. The hotel is very convenient and away from down town. The Old Town Shuttle is a good idea, but it runs only once and hour. It's always packed because of this and the fact that it services four hotels. It was a waste of 20. The rooms were clean, the pool was hot as a sauna, and the breakfast was okay. We would stay again.Dear Phillip H,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Unfortunately Parking on this Island is a hot commodity, but I must agree that some of the spaces do seem narrow. We are also continuing to work on how we can make our shuttle better.

2.0,"Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.

2.0,"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other.

But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money.

Good: position on south beach road is great, roof top pool great, nice room, hotel a little tired, stained carpets cracked bathroom work tops etc. my advice would be replace carpets in room halls ways from lift to room. lots of stains. iced water by lift this is great. lovely bed and pillows.stayed one night, lovely lady on reception day we left, helped us get a taxi.

We went back for drinks later at night and the main bartender was rude, he fitted right into the ambiance of this nasty little nugget.The breakfast buffet is always one of the highlights of my stay at this establishment. It's reasonably priced with top quality selection and service. The terrace view is calming with all the trees and water fountains babbling in the background.The pool was just 'remodeled' for memorial weekend but as always it was over packed and there were about 15 chaise lounge chairs for a large hotel. The hotel must buy some chairs for the clients. We had to sit on the concrete both days with our 2 year old. Next time we will bring our own chairs.I talked to the staff who said the entire hotel is in a remodel phase and I'm sure they will address these minor details.

3.0,"PRO -The room was very clean, but old which was consistent with many review I read prior to booking. -The cost was reasonable for the location. -The location was convenient CON Some upgrades were needed, such as: -an exhaust fan for the bathroom - the steam would condense on the ceiling where some mold/mildew and grown, and this liquid mixture would drip down from the ceiling. -the high speed wireless internet was slow and intermittent. My iPhone constantly dropped the signal or could not find it at all. I ran a speed check and the results showed a download speed of 1.39 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.34 Mbps. Perhaps this is high speed in some countries, but in the DC area, I consider this to be quite slow. It was complimentary, however, where other places have a surcharge for internet access. -There was no thermostat for HVAC so the room would go from warm to cool based on the control dial on the unit which was not temperature calibrated, but was simply warmer/cooler. -The elevators were small and slow, but functional. -The 6.00 breakfast did not include eggs or bacon. I hoped for a better meal for the money. Choices included coffee, juice, cereal, milk, sweet rolls, and packaged pancakes. I did not try the pancakes. There may have been other similar choices, but there were no more substantial choices as I recall. The preparation area was quite congested.

From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality.

1.0,"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor.

The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..,2011-07-28
3.0,"Would rate 3.5 rather than 3.0 stars. Location boosts value. Convenient to Arlington National Cemetery. Shuttle available to Metro Station. Grocery store and restaurants nearby. Staff friendly and helpful. Although comfortable and clean, public areas, hallways and rooms are dated. Nearby stairs useful when the only two elevators are busy. Breakfast area on third floor has nice view, but included breakfast average. King suite a little smaller than expectations. Full kitchen nice, but did not use this trip. Additional daily charge for self parking. Overall, a little pricey for condition of property. Might stay again, but will run through all the available options and prices first.",2010-07-17

That was particularly disappointing as that was one of the factors I looked at when choosing a hotel. Also, the view we had was the parking lot, not the city view I expected.

She was very informative of the surrounding area and helped us get around to places that we wanted to go to. The bathroom and whole room was very clean and pleasant.

2.0,"I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room. I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean. I found a dried up contact lense in our bed, there was mildew in the tub, and the room could have used a sweeping. The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again.",2015-01-27

2.0,"This hotel gets the job done. It gives you a place to sleep... that is, unless the staff decide to give your room to someone else, like they did during my stay. Imagine my surprise as I lounged on the bed with my fiance watching TV when someone unlocked our room door and walked in with her luggage! Of course that meant we had to reset our keys. The hotel also gives you a decent breakfast the night after your stay. Unfortunately each of the juice containers dispense juice along with black residue that settles in the bottom of your cup, so you'll probably want to stick with one of the two hot tea options. Try to get a room on the upper floors, as there was a religious concert of some sort complete with electric guitars and full drum set on the bottom floor at 8:30 am Sunday morning. If you're trying to relax in your room after waking up, beware that it might not be that tranquil as the cleaning women yell at each other down the hallway for about 45 mins-1 hr as they clean your floor.",2013-08-06

5.0,"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner.

I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it!

4.0,We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel.,2015-08-03

Although this is not the closest hotel property to either, it is the best as far as hospitality and professionalism go. We arrived a bit before the posted check in and before too long, we were able to go to our room. I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk. The smiling and professional service that she provided is what one would expect at a Ritz Carlton or St. Regis property. Note to management: You should hold on to and value employees like Adilene.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your 5 star review.

The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us.

1.0,"I was always happy with Hyatt Place customer service, except for the one time I stay at the Lithonia location. My first bad experience came from the front desk staff. I came there on a slow Monday afternoon (02/08/2016) first time at 12:30. She didn't let me check in. I came back around 2:00 and she still not letting me... More",2016-02-10

3.0,"This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W.",2017-01-17
4.0,"So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service- this is not your hotel. If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often.",2018-07-15

5.0,"Even though I'm a local I stayed here with a group before a cruise. Right across from the space needle and they offer a shuttle for the downtown area. Because its across from the Monorail station it makes getting downtown super easy. New rooms with electric shades, refrigerators and microwaves. While rooms are slightly smaller the furnishings are top notch. The breakfast buffet is great with an omelette bar and lots of fresh fruits. Lobby bar and restaraunt is very reasonable and good. I'd be happy to recommend this hotel to friends and travelers as its super nice.davidgmg,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your staycation here in Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

The maid was very nice and friendly. We ate at three of the restaurants that are onsite. Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks. To top off our trip, one of us won a royal flush.

3.0,"I've stayed in so many Chicago hotels I lost count. This location is excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful and hip. Room very modern, large and included a fridge and pull out comfy chair. Parking was only 36 per 24 hours here. Recalling that you are in a big city here and not some country estate, would night noise from the Loop be a surprise Would a panhandler on the sidewalk be a shock Of course not. If these things are disturbing to you, don't stay here. If you crave peace and quiet, four star ambiance and price, you should go up to the Peninsula. The Italian restaurant in the building is very charming and did I mention the building is an architectural masterpiece by Herbert Hugh Riddle, 1928 Its a gem.",2010-06-14
