5,Nice clean spacious supermarket plus nice helpful pleasant staff 😊,2021-11-01
1,Lidl Please stop forcing users to use this app. It's makes queue times longer when users opens their phone and try to figure how to use this. Old Lidl was better when you didn't need any app to have cheap price.,2024-01-04
4,Good,2022-04-04

5,Good offers and on the spot vouchers,2021-10-29
3,Very annoying that you don't get long to spend the vouchers .,2023-01-19
5,This is a very good app I will highly recommend,2023-05-28
4,"Technically the app works well but it's far less useful than it was. It was fantastic with superb discounts across whole product ranges on offer. Nowadays those are far more restrictive, and rarely of interest as they focus on less essential products and I'm on a budget. Scratchcards are rarely useful as items are out of stock. My local Lidl is having real supply chain issues so I am reluctantly now shopping more at Aldi and Asda as stock is more reliable.",2022-11-19
5,Good product at good value . Plenty of varieties and stock,2022-11-10
5,Easy to use & updated regularly,2022-06-21

5,Good,2023-02-26
4,Good for the aged!,2022-10-30
4,"It's great. Easy to use, and does everything an app like this should, plus the virtual ""everyone's a winner"" scratch cards are a nice touch. My only nitpick is when looking through the leaflets, zooming towards the corners and edges can be a bit difficult. Rather than the usual pinching your fingers, you have to tap the screen, but the further from the centre of the leaflet you tap becomes less accurate.",2022-02-25
3,"Last week was told card not registered.card lost since.means apart from asking you for replacement i would then have to reapply.I havent the encouragement to do so, although we are possibly going to continue shopping with you Thanks Jeremy reice",2022-05-21

5,No problem at all.😊,2023-11-29
4,Just started but leaflets would not work at Houghton Regis store as low signal. So transferred to dunstable store.,2022-01-06
4,Good,2022-08-18
5,It's a good app and the savings are better than other loyalty schemes. The scratch card seems a bit of a gimmick but otherwise it's a good app and recommended. Also shows how busy the shop is and opening hours 👍,2021-12-31
3,"It doesn't register often! If you do not have your smart phone with you,I am told sadly there is no come back, sooner or later. Transparency provides confidence to the customers. In this APP, when the code is scanned at the till, nobody sees what is happening inside! Hence, very uninspiring to the customer.",2024-03-29

1,"Quit it with the forced updates . Yet again today , in the queue turned it on , update.. all i wanted was to get a digital reciept for electrical purchases, but no wouldnt let me scan. Judt update. At the checkout with lousy mobile coverage is not the place to find out there is an update out..thanks for your answer i understand apps need updating . But its the forced nature of your updates.. ""do nothing until its updated"" at least let us scan the code as a minimum.before updating.",2021-11-04
4,Don't understand how to change my password 😒,2022-07-14

5,Puiki programėlė 😊,2021-12-31
5,Its the shop with te Brands,2022-09-17
2,Takes a while to load or sometimes doesn't load at all as it needs internet to work. Also my freebie or end of the month money off coupons sometimes disappear (despite me clicking save) so I lose the discount. A very frustrating app!,2022-03-24
5,Works fine,2022-01-09
4,All straight forward now app working properly.,2021-11-30

5,Always a pleasure to shop here,2022-11-17
5,Grate friendly staff,2022-06-22
1,Was good to begin with but after a while you lose the ability the win any scratch cards. 0 in the last 12 shops. The discount vouchers after reaching milestones have been replaced with cheap free items that aren't really worth it,2023-10-22
5,Good savings if you shop regularly. Easy to use. Keeps a digital receipt for you which is handy if you need to return anything.,2022-03-11
5,Great app for groceries shopping 👍,2022-04-05
5,Good value food,2022-10-27
3,It's generally a good app but we recently had an issue where if you go shopping 1 day before the end of the month it doesn't add up the total amount you spend for that month. So yesterday 30th Sep I went shopping and the total amount would have reached £200 but it didn't add the amount at all so I never received my £10 voucher and didn't get my digital receipt. Not sure if this is a cheeky developers trick or a glitch with the app.,2021-10-01
5,"Easy to shop, good value food.",2021-12-21
5,Fantastic app,2021-12-01
5,Does not show any Lidl shops in Northern Ireland Update: works now. Thanks,2022-09-17
1,"The app won't let me select my local store , i give up",2024-03-03
4,OK 👌,2022-09-08
2,Not enough Value for the money I spend,2023-11-28
4,App has worked well until recently when it started showing fewer coupons than were actually activated. All coupons are usually allowed at the till but it delays the check out to make sure they are all on the receipt. Has the app changed to give this issue?,2023-06-22
5,"App is really good, although the spin to win feature is a waste of time. Win a discount on things you never buy",2021-09-30
3,"They have updated the rewards, obviously not for the better. £10 off for reaching £200 in a month was great. 10% off for reaching £250 isnt great. But at least it's still money off. Will continue to use the app as normal, anything is better than nothing. But the value of this app has diminished massively. Getting a free W5 product at £150 spend isn't really making up for anything given how bad the W5 products are. Real shame, but again, better than nothing.",2022-10-29
5,Easy to use,2022-01-07
1,Loaded the app. It could not find the local store in Visby sweden,2023-12-04

4,OK,2022-06-10
1,"Every time there's a new update I can't use the app until I update it, and there's no way around it. I'm not bothered about updates, the app works fine and I can barely see an improvement from one update to another, so please don't force people with useless updates. Not to mention how frustrating it is to wait outside in the cold to update the app, on poor signal, before you get inside to do your shopping and collect points.",2021-12-01
1,"I give one star and that because of only one reason - you have to constantly log in to the app, because after some time it will log you off. Why not made up so, that it will let you logged in all the time? Recently I can't even log in, as the app crashes everytine I type in my password, so can't use it at all.",2021-10-09
5,Great App When it works,2022-01-11

5,Easy to use. All communication stored. I like that you can see till receipt. One of the best supermarket apps,2022-07-27
3,The app is asking me to update. I click on update button and it opens the app...cant update it,2022-04-04
3,Please make Lidl plus card maximize the brightness of my phone screen Optional. Thank you,2021-11-11

5,Good to use,2022-07-16
4,"Kan veel beter. Klant meer power geven. Minder oponthoud bij kassa veroorzaken. 1. De app logt mensen soms uit zonder dat ze dat weten. Komen ze bij de kassa achter. 2. De app wil soms per se updaten als je bij de kassa staat zonder dat je dat kunt uitstellen. 3. De app attendeert je soms op iets, bijvoorbeeld een Advent aanbieding, als je bij de kassa staat zonder dat je dat kunt uitstellen. Daardoor gebruik ik de app vaak niet. Ik zie dat de app ook bij anderen oponthoud veroorzaakt.",2023-12-12
5,Love lidol..Great value for money ....I'm trying to update the app but it jyst gies back to ..update app again 🤫🤔,2022-02-25
5,Lovely food fresh bread nice wine great choice great fridge and freezer section but miss the mint chocolate lolli ices,2021-10-24
4,Just fine,2021-12-09
1,"Would prefer a card don't always Carry my phone, it also holds up the que while you log in which can be slow depending on signal strength. Don't like the app at all.",2021-10-07

2,"I have had the App for a while , and on the whole it ok, that is till they changed the coupons ( earned through spending) , at £50 you get a bakery item ,£100 -£2 off as before--now its , £ 150 a W5 product ,and now £250 for 10% off , where as before it was £200 spend gave you a £10 off without having to spend £100 to equal the same , not forgetting the extra £50 to get there . The coupons are more often things you don't buy and repeat frequently, it used to be so much better",2022-11-14
5,Today was the first time I have visited the store staff was very polite and customers were very helpful and friendly towards each other,2022-07-03
4,Good app have been using it since it came out. I had a message to update and it says not available for my device. So I cannot use the app as it won't download.,2022-09-15

3,"I don't seem to be able to log out of the app. Have forgotten my password and the instructions of how to retrieve it are invalid because it says to hit the link under the login, but I cannot access the login page and cannot log out. So stuck. Other than that the app is ok except it never has coupons for things that I buy. Also, cannot earn the discount because my husband does half the shopping and has been bumped out of the app on his phone and we can't find the password to get him back in.",2022-01-08

5,Really appreciate a bargain!,2023-01-26
5,I like the vouchers! Especially the £2 and £10 ones. Way better than all other supermarkets imo,2022-07-02
3,"They need to remind you to use your app, find when I shop with children I forget. Also I think once you earn the coupons they should stay till you can use them, not expire so quickly.",2021-12-22
5,Great to use and save,2022-04-28
2,"Great when it works but I lose coupons I've earned often which is really annoying. Especially when it flashes up that I've got it, only to not appear in my coupon section.",2023-09-26
5,Easy to use. Clear and precise.,2022-02-24
2,Offers are often not what I would buy and on my birthday didn't get my promised free cookie. Most of the time the things on offer that i am interested in aren't available. Most of my experiences using the app us disappointment. Upside it's an easy app to use.,2022-05-24
2,Ok,2021-11-06
5,"Always helpful, obliging, pleasant assistants...",2022-01-03
2,Complicated. You have to activate the coupons And I have activated one that say buy for more than 40 and you get 5 back but I didn't get it back. Some thing else must be activated,2023-12-16

5,Great,2022-09-22
4,Good,2023-02-26
5,"Was better when you got a £10 voucher for spending £200, but 10% off next shop after spending £250 in 1 month can be useful if you don't go shopping for a week first. Annoyingly the free bakery item chooses the cheapest item, so you'll have to not buy those croissants if you want a free boule. The discounts are useful in these expensive times though.",2022-12-02
4,Happy with shops and the staff.,2022-06-23
3,"Since when there is only België and not Belgique? Can you imagine I like the apps to be only in English? Then ask your Business Analysts to act upon! Three stars because I cannot change the language to English in België. Yeah, English is not an official language in Belgium and you lack basic UX skills if you are xenophobic.",2022-09-02
3,I have been happily using this app for about a year. The Lidl pay feature is very useful. I had to reinstall the app and my credit card details though because it just stopped working entirely,2023-10-14

5,Easy to use.,2022-10-26
1,Must I show the Qcode before checkout? Then how do I claim my free pastry item as there is no mention how to do this and my chosen item was refused at the till. All this time the Q were held up! An unhelpful experience! What should I do? May I suggest the app should do this automatically! Not prester the cashier!,2022-04-21

5,Really easy to use.,2022-09-14
1,"BUG: The app worked properly until recently, but then the Lidl plus card (QR code) just disappeared! And there is no way to recover it. FEATURE: You cannot use English language (generally, you cannot use any other language) in Lithuania. Now it is useless.",2023-01-12
5,Exceptional idea!,2022-01-16
3,Keeps dropping out in store and wont update.,2022-02-24
5,"Very useful if you do a lot of shopping at Lidl, with access to coupons, weekly Lidl leaflets, information on when your local store is most/least busy. If you register the app's QR code in the shop when paying (necessary for e-coupons), the app keeps records of how much you spent at lidl and when. Useful for budgeting, some people may have privacy concerns.",2022-06-11

1,"App is ok, it functions. However get many discount offers for things I don't buy, so no saving there. And the earned discount monetary vouchers are very time limited, so easy to loose them, because your shopping can't fit Lidl time frame!",2022-02-25
1,The rewards are so meagre and you have to spend so much to get them that I don't bother to use the app,2023-08-11
3,"Re-installed app, after it stated 'not available in your area' and still cannot log in!! Help received from Customer Service....... login needed to have access to your address & use Chrome. Plus, delete VPN. I'm happy now, I use this app a lot....",2022-12-16

1,"It was brilliant. But now the £10 for reaching £200 has gone, replaced with the 10% off a shop, less attractive to shop at Lidl as much now. Benefits are as other supermarkets",2022-09-21
1,Will not send me a code to activate account I've tried months ago and no success. So when my local Lidl reopened again I said I would try again still the same can't get code to open account.,2021-11-18

1,It's so expensive now like all SoCal super markets for the people.. Remember when they first came €200 fill your trolley 🛒 . Bloody terrible 😔 it's called greed,2022-08-18
1,The discount codes like 10% should apply automatically not have to be manually selected by the customer who invariably forgets then gets very frustrated when you get an email reminder AFTER you have done your weekly shop. It's left a sour taste to be honest why put the onus on the customer??,2023-08-27
1,Forced updates without warning!! Updated my phone this morning and all the apps. When I get to the checkout the app forces me to update and I cannot access the barcode to scan it. Takes over 4 minutes to update and log in so not able to use Maybe you could try testing your updated process in the real world and not just forcing updates when people are trying to buy shopping. Would it be that hard to have an update and a card button???,2022-07-23

5,"This app is a great idea but could be improved. I was asked to answer some questions so they could tailor the weekly vouchers to my shopping but I have repeatedly been given pet food or children's care , when I have neither!!. Plus the scanner has been put inside the protection screen at the checkout which is awkward and slows things down. Not as good now the £10 voucher has gone. 10% off is OK if your buying for a family. And can carry a lot of shopping and have the money for a large shop.",2022-11-18

1,"Used to be nice to get the odd freebie in the form of cheap goods, now just give small discounts for those same items. If a service gets worse, especially intentionally, this will always have a negative effect on the end user. A Lidl employee told me that many of their own staff have stopped using this app. I also see that Lidl never responds to any posts mentioning the removal of the freebies. Coincidence? Nope. The app mainly benefits Lidl, giving free analytics and less overheads on receipts.",2023-03-18

1,"Let's play a game, let's waste our time. Like so many modern corporations Lidl wishes to price discriminate. I.e. charge some consumers more whilst still appearing cheap to the price savvy. In Lidls case this is achieved through coupons and shopping targets. Waste your time with coupons, apps and targets or waste your money by not. It leaves a sour taste. And makes returning more items, not caring about the shop and wasting lidls time etc feel like justice",2024-01-08
5,Amazing shop,2022-01-06

1,"Deleting the app, just waste of time, takes time to load. Once reaching near target for spending money then suddenly disappears to reset with next month. It's unfair. Coupons are mostly expired. In addition one has to add otherwise you're paying full amount.",2024-01-19

4,"How can I rate it better, when I scan the barcode and not know if it worked. As for the cashiers that suggest it has worked if it makes the noise, they are wrong! Isn't it bad enough that points can't be added retrospectively? A year on and it's improved drastically. Now if u hear the sound, it's registered. Only negative is that points can't be added retrospectively.",2022-07-28

1,Shouldn't this app be destinated to all of your customers??? Including old people who don't have the latest device model???

I love the storing of digital receipts, that means no more hangong onto paper receipts that fade over time. Excellent feature. Easy to return things when the receipt is on your phone.

5,"I use the St.Leonard's On Sea store and the high level of customer service is 5* A well maintained store with very warm and friendly staff whom are always very helpful if needed. This App is very easy and simple to use and best thing I think is the leaflets are available on the app so being as people are using the app all the more. I would like to see #Lidl to set a date to no longer issuing the leaflets in store. Which obviously has a cost element as well as the, ""carbon/,green"" effect.",2021-12-23
5,"The Application is very good provided you are a regular shopper. We tent to shop every two to three weeks so we miss out on a lot of the offer. That said it is easy to use, you get notifications telling you the offers, so that's a plus.",2022-07-28

1,I have not the slightest idea how to use this app. With Tesco you just shop and receive all the savings.

1,Uduelige app. Hele tiden ny opdatering. Og hver gang man opdater så skal man logge på forfra på jeres APP med e-mail og adgangskode forfra. Virkelig irriterende. Og irriterende at man skal bruge en APP til at få tilbud og at i ikke bare kan sætte prisen på varen til den pris den uge varen er på tilbud. I de fleste af jeres butikker har mobilen svært ved at få forbindelse til mobil data eller andet problem som opstår ved appen og så opstår der kø og så er folk i køen sur og man får skylden.,2022-05-29

1,"The app doesn't work. It asks to select a store but it says that there was problem with it. If I close the app and open it again it doesn't ask me to select the store anymore, but nothing else works. I can't select a coupon, I can't see my Lidl card. So basically a useless app right now.",2022-07-23

1,"A Lidl Deceit. Has anyone else noticed how the Lidl Rewards scheme has been devalued a Lidl bit. Before October 2022 if you spent £200 or more in a month you got a £10 coupon to spend on a future shop. But now with a Lidl bit of trickery the upper target is now £250 and your reward is 10% off your furture shop. So to get the equivalent £10 off your shop you have spend another £100, that's now a total £350. In this time of a cost of living crisis I find that a Lidl disrespectful.",2023-01-03

Lidl have done nothing obvious to ensure a WiFi connection. I spent £103 yesterday & cashier managed only by my phone number to credit the spend so I received a £2 voucher. It is only valid for 6 days, i live alone & will not shop again in 6 days, just to use £2 voucher. It costs me £5 to get to nearest store!!!",2022-12-08

1,"Previously, all the deals where laughably insignificant, clearly used to clear the shelfs of products you would not usually buy. The only reason of using this app, the £10 off next purchase is now scrapped so what point of bothering with it. New feature of 10%off after spending £250 is ridiculous. You already spend the amount of a month worth of groceries, 10%off on your next 55p croissant will make no difference. Also all shops block phone reception so app will not open at times.",2022-09-08

5,Very good. I've used this app a few times now and even without Wi-Fi it always works in the store. All the vouchers always work so I'm extremely happy and I like the fact that you get get a discount if you spend so much every month. Cool. Edit: Would like to see a £300 and £400 target with commensurate rewards above that of 2 accounts × £200.,2022-05-04

They got rid of the 10 pound off your shopping reward, now it's all been cleverly rearranged and the most you get off as a set amount is a measly 2 quid. What a disappointment.

Twice now I've gone shopping and bought things I wouldn't have otherwise thinking I'd make a saving due to coupons I'd had, only to discover afterwards that I hadn't activated said coupons. Surely the coupons should activate automatically on your app? It'd certainly be a lot easier for someone like me who keeps forgetting to manually activate them.

With everyone feeling the crunch to the cost of living crisis this is a slap in the face. Supply chains issues means stores dont have full stock.

Many times,the app doesn't work/I can't log in just at the time that I need it i.e. at the checkout.And if you forget to activate your coupons before scanning the app at checkout,then you don't get your money off.",2022-03-19

1,"Appalling. The app system just repeats items when releasing new coupons or via the scratch card. So if you shop once a week, the coupons cancel each other out, lidls call it incompatibility. Dreadful ill thought out as you can't benefit, or is it intentional to save lidls money?. I have contacted customer service who had little interest and claimed a sign in reset would solve, it didn't. So please resolve it Lidls!",2023-07-10

4,It's nice but not so great that you can only use one coupon at a time. Normally it tells you if you can't use two similar ones but these weren't simlar had to put my items back and waste everyone's time. I was so excited but now I'm disappointed using this app. I don't know if this is because I used a self check out or if this is a new rule. It used to work before.,2023-07-22

1,Безумно е да минаваш на дигитализация и да нямаш безплатен интернет в обекта. Днес влязох в магазина и не можах да активирам ваучер. Вземете пример от Билла. В обектите им има безплатен интернет.,2022-03-05
1,"Just had to set my app up again at the till, bloody awful, why on earth can't it keep details, so I had a bad experience, so I gave that experience to the rest in the queue... Its not like I'd open the app outside the store... I get that there may be reason to, but I don't... Shame as lidl is a good brand",2023-03-15
5,Brilliant,2021-12-11
3,"On the postive side the App works well. On the negative side, I had reached a target and qualified for a £2 off voucher. I did another shop and was expecting a discount for same amount but found that the voucher had expired. It seems you have to shop regularly and spend a lot to get a significant discount. I should also mention that a couple of times when I went to scan the app at checkout,I found the app had logged out. I missed out on coupons for those shops as I couldn't remember the password",2021-11-21

5,"Great app, I use it everytime I shop. With weekly offers and the current special advent offers, it's well worth downloading. Also if that hasn't convinced you, you earn a scratchcard with each shop (chance of winning another coupon).

3,"Not great, I have had a few instances where the stor Internet has been down so was unable to add to my shopping total. The monthly figures mean I lose out on savings if I reac £200 early in the month. The app tries to con me into accepting a £2 saving when I am not far off the £200 target. Most other loyalty schemes have a running total so that the savings build all the time. Tesco issue tokens with a long expiry date unlike lidl's voucher which expires very quickly.",2021-10-22

I use Lidl a lot but now that you have replaced the £10 voucher (£200 spend in a month) To 10% off next shop, I will not be taking part anymore.

1,"1. Every time I scan the app on the self-checkout counter, it asks for the cashier to come and verify it. 2. It has offers such as CHF 5.- for purchases above CHF 50, but when you try to use them by activating them, they don't work, and even the cashiers don't know how to fix it.",2024-01-13
5,Easy and rewarding,2021-12-08
1,Useless app. I use to go and shop at lidl to build up on points to get the £10 off. I always did a big shop at lidl. Twice I never got the coupon and did ask staff why. No one could help. Now I shop and nothing works on the app. Its absolutely useless. No savings at all.,2022-12-06

1,"Uninstalled after long time use.No added value for a regular customer.Benefits Lidl gets don't outweigh (no) value the customer gets.The app provides a great source of information for Lidl eg tracking stores visits, insights in customer behavior, location data and customer whereabouts, amount and time purchases done connected directly to customer's bill.The app doesn't respond to customer's needs-vouchers not personalized to customers' shopping lists + bill summary not available for later review",2021-10-17

1,"A waste. I got to the counter and asked the cashier to add the points but it turns out that is not possible. The only thing it does is gives you some ( very limited) ridiculous offers( you don't really need) and in any case, these items weren't even in stock 🙄",2022-03-28
1,Downgraded bonus package is disincentive to shop. Spend £250 to then have to spend at least£100 to get £10 off is a waste of time and effort as it is highly unlikely that is going to happen and people will likely only save a few pence as they will have already had to do their big shop!,2022-10-06

Checked app later, today's purchase not showing on app. This happened a lot when the scheme started, Lidl customer service always said they couldn't do anything, so customers lose out and Lidl profits from its error. I thought the glitch was fixed. Obviously not",2022-09-01

1,The app keeps asking for an update which my mobile does not support and does not let me proceed to login and get benefitted from current coupons and lidl discounts like i did so far! Unacceptable!!

1,"Didn't get through the registration process. Two steps authentication, phone code, e-mail, password (!!!!) just to get to couple of coupons is just too overcomplicated. Simple discount card would be more than enough. Deleting the app, not worth it",2022-11-28

3,"Giving it another try having found out more about how Lidl run things. Crossing a spending threshold gains a free item which is good but it a shame that offer is open only for a week. Recently having had to do quite some healthcare I miss out. If Lidl push much, what for me, will be unhealthy they usually have some offers going on fresh food, whole foods, veg and fruit. The free bakery item on £50 cumulative spend only applies to in store baked items.",2024-03-27
1,"Spin to win is useless, you never get anything useful. Old small discount vouchers were much better. Oh and the copy paste 'look we really care' reply from their web team is insulting to say the least. Not a single f has been given there, just a generic reply to make it seem they care and asking you to email with further questions. I don't have any questions, just a terrible app that you need as a scannable card is too expensive for lidl.",2022-02-04
5,Used to be great but I have problems with it. I have scanned my code in shop but my spending has not been registered in app. What's wrong with it now? No rewards any more as nothing is being registered by the app:( Seems to be ok now,2022-07-28

5,"Top notch, easy to navigate.",2022-11-03
5,Always value for money and management top notch,2021-11-27
2,Used to be a really worthwhile app. Since the change from the free £10 once you hit a £200 spend (along with the £2 at £100 spend this gave you 6% off your total shop!) to the 10% off your next shop once you hit the £250 mark it's all been made it a rather pointless exercise for me as I only shop in small but regular amounts. Rather disappointing.,2023-01-17

4,It's a good app for rewards and discounts. It would be good if the rewards were tailored to what I buy though. I have completed the in-app questionnaire about my diet and spending habits so the deals I win or earn should reflect my preferences.,2022-09-25
4,"Doesn't always login to site via the store WiFi, which means that you can't always use the coupons or collect points for your purchases. I know l could use my own mobile WiFi but that defeats the object of having in store WiFi.",2022-02-25

5,"I love this app, at first I didn't want to get it as I heard people saying it wasn't scanning, but I love this app, although I don't get the discounted items all the time it'll come in handy due to prices increasing, and if I manage to spend enough in a month I eventually get money off and I don't even have to spend £100 to get £2.00 off, all I have to do is keep going to the shop and it adds the money I spent that day to the previous amount I spent and it slowly gets to £100, it's great 😊👍",2022-07-16
4,Good to shop at Lidl. Tanks,2022-10-07
5,"It took me a while but it does when I go to a different shop, the overall impression was really good and when I asked one of your team how to use the app she was very polite and helpful, so was the young lady on checkout , credit to you all so thank you.",2022-12-13

5,Don't forget your shopping bags or your pound for the trolley... I got through the checkout only to be told I can't take the blue basket with my shopping in out to the car... Two carrier bags and 40p lighter I escaped!! Plus I qualified for a monthly spending voucher which wasn't taken off my shopping at the time (like I thought it would be) I have to come back and use it within 7 days...

Once logged in, I was pushed to select my store again - and not given the opportunity to do anything else. It immediately homed in on the one I'd already selected but the ""Select this store"" button was greyed out and the app wouldn't allow me to select a different one. Edit: reinstalled a few days later and seems OK now, though not tested in store yet.",2021-10-20

1,"For some reason I can only select Lidl GB stores? I am not in GB, I don't live there, my phone isn't set to there, I don't have a vpn there. Why can I only get the British version of the app all of a sudden? It was fine before?",2024-03-15
3,Leaflets have zoom but you can't move around the page to see it all just the middle. It's just so very nearly implemented. Seems pointless and it's annoying. I have to download the leaflet then use another app on my phone to zoom and look at it.,2022-07-04

Darbuotojas padaro grąžinimą, bet apie tokį appso elgesį net jis nieko nežino ir painiojasi. Naudoju appsą tik dėl el. čekių, bet ir čekis appse galėtų atsirasti nedelsiant, idant tiktų atidaryti išėjimo vartelius.",2024-01-30

1,Coupon Plus is being changed from Sep22 so that you no longer get a £10 coupon after a £200 monthly spend. Instead after £250 they are giving a 10% off your next shop voucher. This means you will have to spend £100 on your next shop to get £10 off which I never do. With the cost of living crisis this is terrible publicity for Lidl. Probably will uninstall after spending this months £10 coupon.,2022-08-31

1,A change to the £10 off voucher to be replaced by a 10% off has made this app almost pointless to use anymore. The money off product vouchers are never reflective to what is bought.,2022-09-29
2,I don't like the fact that this app won't let you use it when there's an update pending. Several times I've opened it at the checkout and haven't been able to use it for this reason. The mobile signal in my local store is terrible so I couldn't update the app if I wanted to.,2023-05-23

4,"Lovely idea but ..... why do I have to make weekly visits? Usually we will do at least 2, maybe 3 big shops a month. Our spend is higher than required but we spend it in less visits. So does that mean because we don't fit into the structured pattern of visits, we miss out. So far i have not got any coupons, scratch cards or treats, why? I seem not to find anything on the app?

Also it often requires an update and if you don't, you cannot use the app. This all is making it totally uselles. You are spending your time fidling with the app instead of shopping.

Sometimes, at the store, there isn't even the product that's shown on the lid plus application, and it sucks that u need internet for it . It should be without any internet or anything.

1,"Absolutely rubbish app, and the point system is just a rip off. If the points are going to be rolled out like tesco atleast it will motivate the customer. loosing the point every month is just lack if common sense. Contacting Customer service is just a nuisance. I have contacted customer service 3 times for my points with no luck. The app doesn't show all items I store to check the spec. Needs lots of improvement.",2021-10-21

4,Lidl Treat never available. They never offered any other option to customers. Staff always says apologise for inconvenience. I liked Lidl but it is embarrassing that treat are not available most of the times. Management should offered any clearance products or any other value products to keep the customers happy. Because some customers only went for treat option. So kindly resolve this matter in future for all lidl customers. Thanks,2021-12-01

1,"In some Lidl stores there is no internet reception. In this case this application does not open and it is therefore impossible to access his loyalty card.

Have often earned £2 & £10 off coupons in past and lost them either due to them not having been activated (stupid me) or run out of date when landing in hospital and wife didn't have my phone and we lost coupon value.

5,Have been shopping at Lidl since the start of the pandemic as it was the closest supermarket to my house and I could walk there. Was very surprised at the quality of the fresh produce and their other products are of a high standard as well. As a result I downloaded this app and have been saving money on my shopping every week by using their discount vouchers on specific food items. Would recommend downloading this app and regularly shopping at Lidl if you want to save money.,2022-04-21
3,It's a rigmarole navigating and remembering to have the app open when shopping but it's not rocket science most apps are a pain in the a***. I suppose it's what we have to go through for security and to save money.,2022-06-15

2,"Logs me out often so that people in line have to wait for me at check out making it a weird and frustrating situation. Also when there's a campaign, I have to calculate my shopping so I can make 2-3 split receipts to have 2-3 entries in the lottery, otherwise it just gives you 1 entry even if your receipt is worth 2 or more. Really bad design. I also agree with other users that the coupons should activate by themselves until the expiry date",2022-03-30

4,Good,2023-01-14
5,"I like LIDL's App. Everything is clear and the promos are usually good (you get coupons and small discounts). The App is easy to navigate. The only trick is, when you buy something using your coupon and want to return it later (for ex. a faulty item) they only give you back the discounted price. So it's like you lost a bit of that earned coupon- worth keeping that in mind. (They don't subtract the coupon's value from the overall bill, they discount each item accordingly).But overall- all good.",2021-10-24

5,"Very helpful staff, plenty of choice n bargains at low prices compared to larger supermarkets. The only problem I have is that obviously the staff need to rush through the sale. It's very hard if you are disabled like myself, having to sort out the app, pack n pay for the good without holding customers up behind you. A fob card would be much easier. So although I gave 5 * for the store, the app I give 2*.",2022-04-05

Lidl Customer Services are a total joke - don't have a clue.

After more than 2 years of usage I really don't see what's the point of the app. I mostly use it for discounts (a feature that might easely function without a digital app dependence) and local server crashes or errors in identifying the qr code happened more than once, thus having me pay the full price.",2022-10-26

After checking the box and pressing the button you are presented with the same thing. Again and again. The member of staff that I spoke to said I had to log out and then log back in. But at the checkout who has time to do that?! This app needs to be a lot more stable. It's a good idea, what what good is an idea with poor execution?",2022-02-09

I don't need a bagand it is safe to transport home on my motorcycle. I am now told, I CAN BUY 18 BOTTLES, but only if I pay with two transactions, I do not understand why!

3,"Generally works ok .. You do have to wave your phone around in front of the sensor and get the beep to know it registered but you can do this almost any point even after the shop total comes up. Big negative is no way to add a shop reciept later if you forgot to use it or the system is down. Big plus is you get actual money off the shop after spend 200 in a month ie not just coupons. You do have to ""activate"" the coupons before use but generally they last a week befor expiring.",2024-03-20

Coupons are probably the main reason people download the app. Not only that the user needs to save the coupon, but then activate it for the discount to apply.

3,"Good except i got ready made chicken dinner last wed and i cud not eat it, the chicken was too tough and hard. I rang lidl in wellpark galway then and spoke to a staff member and she said i cud get a free dinner when i shop again, i don't think this is good enough, i had no dinner that day but i suppose its better than not getting anything at all.

5,Good,2021-11-04
4,I dislike having to 'activate' coupons. Seems a sneaky way of Lidl not giving a discount!,2023-01-25
2,Coupons are fine if you can actually buy what is on the coupon. My birthday cookie was a good idea but none of the local stores had any stock due to delivery issues. Everyone seems to have the same coupons so the items are quite often sold out.,2022-04-04

2,"Not everyone who's in Germany speaks German. It would be appreciated to have an option to choose a global language like English. I can find the advertisements from partners on Lidl's website, it seems unnecessary to have it in the app as it makes it cluttered.

1,Waste of time. Lidl please stop use this app,2023-05-23
1,I've only been able to use 1 voucher. The damn app needs updating every time I do a big shop so I've recorded barely any of my purchases. A waste of phone storage. I've had to update it twice in 8 days,2021-12-01

1,Nuisance app. Just give money off for every 50 euro spent. The 'treats' are usually either sold out or junk food. Having to use the phone in the shop is a nuisance. A little card with a bar code would be handier.,2021-11-16

1,"One of the worst loyalty programmes available. One month to build up a reward but only 7 days to use it? Ridiculous. And today the daily Christmas Coupon wouldn't load. Bad enough that if you are tempted it's only valid for two days, but not getting the offer at all? Also, what is it with encouraging people to visit the shops so frequently, have people forgotten Covid is still out there doing harm?",2022-12-07

Recently we noticed that when we scan the QR code at the checkout, the monitor does bleep to acknowledge acceptance. However the credit does not show up on the balance record for the Two/Ten pounds vouchers. It keeps showing up as ZERO. This app is no good. One feels being cheated of the spend credit repeatedly even after all the assurances from customer service. Trading standards needs to look into this.",2022-10-01

1,"It's a good idea, but what's the point when you have to spend £200 in a month to get money off which resets every month, to finally get the money off coupon just for it to expire in 7 days. Not good enough. Needs to be more like other supermarkets where you can save the money up.",2021-11-21
1,Just give us cheaper prices. It slows down checkout speed. 5p in the pound only when you spend £200 is a joke and the discount coupons are rarely for anything you buy on a regular basis. Probably trying to shift stock that doesn't sell. Oh and on the odd occasion I forget my phone or there is a glitch at checkout or the phone signal is weak you miss out on your spend. Other retailers allow you to add your points on later on presentation of receipts,2022-06-07

Leuk dat je kunt sparen voor gratis producten maar jammer dat het per maand gaat. Ik Denk dat deze app vooral handig is als je veel naar de Lidl gaat en het is natuurlijk handig voor de Lidl als je er nog een Keer heengaat vanwege Lidl plus voordeel.😉,2022-06-29
4,"Like this..works for me. So easy to use. Notifications about coupons and being able to read your reciept on your screen is great! The only downside is that, even now I have been using the app for a while, the offers are NOT tailored to my shopping. I get so many meet offers and meet and milk scratch card vouchers I can't use because my family and myself are vegan, I feel like I am missing out a little and so is Lidl.",2022-04-12

5,Excellent everything was great,2023-12-07
4,This app has been great and have managed the 200 pound coupon a few times. I would have given 5 stars but do not like the change next month. I will never spend 250 in a month and as a small shops consumer the reward is less. I will spend less now as the incentive vs benefit is no longer as good.,2022-08-31

First off, you ""get"" discounts after spending a lot of money, just for those discounts to promptly DISAPPEAR(or run out as app says) when you actually need them. So after spending 50% of average salary, I CAN'T even get a PROMISED discount. Moving on, imagine this...You are in line, 7 people waiting behind you, and you want to usee the app to get points, but no, this garbage wants an update and YOU CAN'T EVEN USE IT. Stay away from this trash.",2023-03-16

1,"En riktig bra gjort app. Jag är imponerade hur bra det är. Det är även lätt att använda. Det tråkigaste är att man måste aktivera erbjudanden innan man få rabatten på sitt köp.

1,It has taken me ages to get the app up and running and now I find it complicated and confusing. I'm going to shop at a shop that makes life easy for me with a store card. Shame as I've been a regular twice a month for 9 years!,2022-01-22

5,Very good,2021-10-22
3,Love the coupon plus although don't always purchase the items. I do think that to use your rewards coupon in a week is not long enough. £10 for a £200 spend but only £2 for a hundred? Doesn't seem that fair. Why not £5,2022-04-05

4,Good value For money 💰,2022-09-02
5,Good,2024-01-03
2,App should cater for different languages. For example if my home country is Ireland and I'm on holiday in Lithuania and change location to that country it should allow English as an extra language instead of just switching it to Lithuanian.. it renders app unusable as I can't navigate it. And I'm sure thousands of tourists around Europe 🇪🇺 having exactly the same problem. Please fix it,2022-07-23

5,Really easy to use,2022-08-18
1,"Why do coupons need to be activated? Activating them has nothing to do with tracking their use. Plus you can't activate in advance, only the day they become valid. A child would create a better functioning app.",2022-06-09

1,"I expected my £5 voucher to be subtracted from my bill today after using the App. It was not. This app is not senior-friendly. I used to get real vouchers that I could use to suit me. Now there are small reductions on things I don't want to buy. Bit of a con really. Must have saved Lidl a fortune. Trying to get my phone out, find the App and get it to work as others are waiting in a queue behind me is an absolute pain. I therefore often do not use it. Definitely not senior-friendly. Who cares???",2023-01-11

3,"Crashes since last update. Reinstall doesn't fix the issue. Used to work just fine up to now. Very sad. Update: 26. Jan: A few days later App worked again. Weird as no version update was done. Could the ""Lidl Backend"" cause the app to crash?",2022-01-26

2,Update for September 2022 Was a great way to help save a few pounds 2£ on 100 £ spend and further 10£ on £200 spend = 6% new offer now just rubbish you have to spend £250 to get a 10% discount on next spend therefore you would need to spend over 100£ to get a £10 discount on that spend. ! Works great. No issues other than remembering to activate offers and discounts. Spin to win is waste of time as never won anything worth much a typical prize being 75p of something you dont want or need.,2022-08-29

The coupon is still perfectly good in the list of coupons and can be redeemed on purchase, but it won't show its details when viewed from the shopping list. Also, I think a long-press functionality should be added to the shopping list where you can ""see details"" instead of tapping on the three dots and then tapping on that.",2023-11-03

Most of the time the vouchers are for surplus Lidl products rather than products you usually go for. Even the vouchers you win on scratch cards are the same for all customers that had shopped on that day. Nevertheless, when there is a voucher of a product I like and has long life I buy bulk with the discount. It is great. You also get partner offers, discounts.",2022-02-27

More often than not Lidl's prices are less. It's also useful that the in store magazine is available via the app electroniccally. Saves on paper waste!",2022-05-30

4,Since Sept. cannot update or install app on any of our android 7 - 10 phones or tablets. Have phoned/emailed customer services but as yet no useful information as to what the problem may be. Used it a lot for fun and disappointed at response from their app tech team blaming our phones/tablets! App now working on tablet and android 6 phone! No info as to why from Lidl. Playstore says not optimised but no longer incompatible! Missed out on a few discounts but glad it works for now at least.,2021-10-05

5,Awesome app and easy to use,2023-01-10
4,"Ich mag es sehr, dass man den digitalen Kassenbon hat und dass man auch digital seine Angebote einsehen kann. Einzige Kritik: Bei Coupons mit Auswahl wird der billigere Preis erlassen, falls man beide Artikel nimmt. D.h. man müsste den billigeren Artikel separat kassieren lassen und würde dadurch Geld sparen, ich find das schwachsinnig",2022-03-26

1,Impossible to log in just won't let me even with account set up I give up Not worth worth the hastle and this app is discrimination against those of us who cannot get this discount app on their mobiles and do not get the advantage on price bring out a card as the co-op for members i now use aldi/co-op/asda i no longer use lidle all the time,2024-02-28
5,It works I wish I could share it with the family. I like that it saves your receipts. Very helpful.,2022-06-28
2,I don't see it as a plus because it's limited for example to buying 2 steaks.....we would buy 4 or 6 & discount only applies to two.....the perception is that it's too much of a bother to be of any use.,2022-06-03

3,The terms and conditions relating to product coupon could be written a lot clearer for people to understand. The app gives good offers however some offers don't suit. I would love to see more healthy food and herb vouchers than bakery items and bags of sugar.,2024-03-29

3,"Insgesamt ok wegen der Coupons. Lidl Pay lässt sich allerdings nicht aktivieren, aus unbekanntem Grund (Google Pay, Payback Pay funktionieren auf dem gleichen Gerät). Man solle laut Hilfeseiten beim Kundendienst nachfragen. Getan - Antwort vom Kundendienst: Lidl Pay lässt sich aus unbekanntem Grund nicht aktivieren... Auf diese ""Hilfe"" kann man dann auch verzichten. Die digitalen Kassenbons sind immerhin ein kleiner Beitrag für den Umweltschutz.",2021-11-08

From now on I'll be going back to Aldi so looks like lidl have lost mine and my mums custom. Well done lidl.",2022-10-07
5,Love Lidl but I agree with another customer that the coupon s you get special offers on are on a too shorter date after a large shop who needs to go shopping 5 or 6 days later ??? A month would be better or at least 3 weeks and it should be on things you reg buy not on things you don't buy. Or no point. Please can you consider these points as I'm sure we are not only people that think this G Bird,2023-06-05

My only issue is I can never get internet service inside the store so I cant check my vouchers or use my card (via app) unless I remember to check prior to visit and screen shot my card . I miss out on many vouchers because of this and my total spend per month does not get recorded correctly. Maybe make it so we can add a receipt via the app that way if your card isnt available for any reason you still add to total,2021-11-14

1,"The update are worst ever, if you don't update the App you cannot use it, it let me down several times in the middle of the shopping. In this case I prefer having a physical fidelity card so I don't miss promotion or points.",2022-05-24

1,Can't find how to register.,2022-04-23
1,"Whilst the app is easy to use and the added benefit of the coupon reward vouchers is a nice to have, I do find it annoying & feel somewhat ripped off that you will get a 15% off voucher through the app one week to then find the following week the same item is on offer at up to 50% off - prime example is the premium instant coffee which is now on offer with a £1.20 saving compared to the voucher saving of 34p!! Certainly doesn't make you feel like a valued customer.",2022-04-21

5,Very good,2021-11-26
3,"5 stars for the UK stores, especially for the one from Maghull, but 1 star for the rest of the Lidl stores from the ""poor"" countries. Around £1500/month is the wage of the worker from UK, and around £300/month for the ""bastard"" from Romania, for example.",2022-02-19
5,Fabulous,2022-08-27
5,"One of the better loyalty card apps. Forget paper receipts, the app will have an electronic copy. I suspect that it learns what you like, and gives you more coupons for those things to get you back in the store. I'm ok with that. Needs internet to work.",2022-05-31
5,I'm very happy with this app,2021-10-14
1,"What's the point of an update, when the update does not work 😡",2022-05-05
1,"As an older person it is difficult for me to understand what I am supposed to do. Some of your staff are quite helpful, others not. Too busy talking to their colleagues about their personal life.

5,Fine. Lovely staff.,2022-06-16
2,Pain in the neck having to update every week. Also coupons and offers should automatically be there rather than having to activate them. More than once I've bought stuff that I wouldn't necessarily have bought thinking it was free or discounted only to find that I have been charged because I forgot to activate. Another con?,2024-02-07

1,"The worst app! Reductions don't work, activated the coupon in the app but won't work once it's time to show it to the cashier (the manager even tried himself, didn't work). Contacted Lidl who told me that they would reimburse me in giving me another coupon as a compensation in the app but they lied, never got anything from them! What a shame!",2022-12-01
3,"I would prefer money off anything rather than specific items, and not set to a limit of a month as we never spend enough. I'm sure it works for large families, but not small ones like ours",2021-11-11

5,Very good store,2021-12-23
1,"Peinlich Almosen, bekommt man. Wenn man seine Telefonnummer, sämtliche Daten und Einkaufsverhalten verkauft und 400€ ausgibt bekommt man einen 4€ Gutschein. Unverschämt, weil man genau weiß dass die Daten mindestens das 20 fache wert sind. Gewinnen kann man Coupons wie zb für EINE Kiwi (gleichzeitig muss man natürlich 10€ ausgeben). Furchtbar. Da Lob ich mir DM, mit der App spart man wirklich was. Hier gab es wohl beim launch mal tolle Gutscheine aber jetzt schon lange nicht mehr.",2024-01-23
5,Nice App and making shopping really fun,2021-10-02
3,Great app but disappointing with the scratch card wins as you tend to win the money off/percentage off items for the different items which they do not sell in mylocal store plus you can get the item 10 times in 1 month which some like me would not buy/use. They should have stuck with money off vouchers (25p-£1.00).,2022-08-06
5,Great app,2024-01-26

5,Brilliant,2022-03-26
4,Very good store to shop in,2022-03-06
1,"1. Zdrapka jest męcząca i irytująca. Kupon powinien być od razu. 2. Brak cen przy kuponach - ""drugi produkt x% taniej"" a brak cen. 3. Brak możliwości zrobienia listy zakupów. 4. Brak możliwości zakupów collect. 5. Brak sprawdzania dostępności art w danym sklepie. 6. Płatne dostawy w sklepie online bez możliwości odbioru osobistego - i to jednak z największych sieci w EU a tacy pazerni.",2023-04-11
5,"Great app, slowly personalises to your shop with helpful coupons and discounts. Really appreciate it. Thanks Lidl!",2022-01-20
4,It's easy,2021-10-30
1,After I spend over £250 monthly the app got issues not to show me the spending amount and the cupon surely doesn't show. Ended up with no £10 discount and with interest to do shopping at another market in the area as customer line told me the cupon was expired.... Ok. But 7 day's to use the cupon can be not enough and this looks like doesn't accommodate me,2022-07-01
5,"Great app easy to use, problem free does exactly as it says it will do",2022-05-20
2,To complicated.,2021-12-24

2,Couldn't use the app at checkout until update was installed. Caused a ten minute delay while I was forced to install the update.,2021-12-01
1,This app used to give you a better deal £10 off when you spent £200 but now it's rubbish you have to spend £350 to get £10 off now so don't bother,2022-09-12

4,It stocks a lot of organic products,2023-02-26
1,"I was a big fan of Lidl until I learnt how the chickens they use in their supply chain are treated.. the conditions in which the poor creatures have to live on factory farms is absolutely repulsive. Until Lidl changes something, e.g. agree to the better chicken commitment, I won't shop there anymore. Lidl on price, even less on animal welfare :-(",2023-01-11

1,"Every 2 days needs an update and then you can't deactivate a coupon. Very irritating and logs you out after updating. Still does the same a year later. It still is doing it and updates too often. Always take a screenshot of ur code, don't rely on the app.",2023-06-11
3,"One of the biggest problems is pricing, ie shelf price differs from till price, which I understand is because tills are updated of new prices prior to shelf change. This causes huge hold ups at the tills which also means goods already on the shelves or store room are increased even though the company purchased at the old price.",2023-01-30
1,It feels like one big scam to get you to stay with Lidl while the reward is always somehow either expired or just short. Everything I try to scan the code at the checkout app logs out and does not let me back in. Odd time I am actually able to reach the coupon goals it turns out they just expired or are about to so straight after shopping you have to go again to be able to actually use the reward. I absolutely hate how Lidl went about the whole loyalty program.,2022-05-19

5,Excellent,2021-10-19
1,Poor experience so far. Middle of Lidle items that show on app aren't actually in store so no point setting the local store. I click on digital receipt and told no internet connection even though I've got both strong WiFi and mobile data connections. Not good when you've been buying things with a three year warranty and no receipt to prove it. Back to asking for printed receipts I'm afraid.,2023-02-26

2,Changing the reward system for £10 off to 10% why? Forcing you also to spend another £50 a month to get this reward.... app has gone downhill. Not the best time to do this with a money crisis in this country. Not happy.,2022-09-04

5,Great to use,2024-02-23
4,"I find the app fun, often the voucher tempts us to diversify. It is like having treats from all sorts of countries cheaper than if you travelled there.

3,"Used to be good with £10 off after £200 spent in a month, that incentive pushed lidl in front of aldi. New incentives are pretty poor when you look at stock levels versus aldi, you couldn't possibly do a £100 shop in lidl to get your £10 off. Some visits its hard to do £40 with empty shelves/freezers. With both stores on my doorstep I will be off to the well stocked aldi next month.",2022-09-29

2,"Not a good way to reward customers, limiting the time to use the rewards before they expire - seven days it's enough. Just want to add you give coupons with money off items that are not available in your store's.

I call that ABSOLUTE GREED. Lidl has become just another greedy corporation. Shame on you Lidl. Especially now, when we are all being squeezed by high energy costs. I will most certainly reduce my shopping at Lidl as a result of this. If there is one thing I hate, it's greedy corporations.",2022-09-25

It tends to forget my login details when I'm at till, and menu system poor and laggy when I'm in, so hassle. I'm also now reducing my visits to the store since the app came out. Offers in it are not tailored to my spending and feel other prices have increased to pay for the perks, the target spend is not aimed at people who live alone.

2,"Coupons should be based on your previous shop or have a ""favourite/wish"" list option. Also they should be active for more than 7 days, not everyone can afford a weekly shop. Reward targets are out of reach for many. Also missing is a stock availability option, especially for ""middle of lidl"" items or click & collect. Maybe hierarchy should check how Nectar, Tesco, Boots reward systems work; Aldi (no rewards) more user friendly & more options, seriously considering switching shopping loyalty.",2022-12-27

If you spent £200 in a month you would get £10 off you next shop. Now you have to spent £250 to get just 10% off your next shop. I'm very disappointed.,2022-09-18

5,All good so far,2022-01-18
4,Good,2022-04-30
1,In year 2023 all other shops have better app. Reasons: 1) when i look for offers it opens web browser and i need to switch back to app manually. 2) when registering to app it opens again.. web browser. Why there is app if everything is jyst linked to website ? 3) not possible to create shopping list or at least i was not able to find it. Everyone who gives rating more than 1 star probably don't have experience with other shops apps.,2023-10-01

1,This app is wasting my phone's battery and time.As a single person I never will be able to use the discount's in a timely manner. The restrictions are to short. Ps. A response from your side would be a waste of time as it only would confirm your incapability for changes to a more shopper friendly App. Also why do call me by my first name 📛 in your App are we friends were is the courtesy????,2023-04-01
2,The app works fine but the rewards are mostly worthless things you never buy it keeps giving me discounts on nuts but I never buy nuts as I am allergic to them it doesn't offer discounts you can use. Especially irritating when it says you have won a prize and it's discount on bags of nuts. Also the new discounts based on spend mean you have to spend £250 instead of £200 to get a decent voucher so again a poorer deal,2022-09-09

5,Professional Staff.,2023-07-18
2,Offers very rarely on the shelves on the required date. Stock levels and therefore the shelves are generally empty of stock. The store is totally run down leaving customers no other choice than to complete their shopping at other stores within the vicinity i.e. Tesco & Aldi. Totally disappointed in Lidl's whom we have supported for a number of years. Loyality is no longer in the forefront of shoppers minds.,2022-08-24

4,"Edit: Danke für die Berücksichtigung meiner Vorschläge, dass 1. Updates nicht mehr die App-Nutzung während des Einkaufs behindern, sowie 3. die Kassenbons in Papierform optional sein sollten. Nun fehlt nur noch der 2. Punkt: Die Papier-Kassenbons sollten nachträglich gescannt & der App hinzugefügt werden können, mittels eines eindeutigen Merkmals (z.B. QR-Code), welches nach relativ kurzer Zeit verfällt. (Natürlich ohne Coupons, aber mit Anrechnung zum ""Rabattsammler"".)",2021-11-05

5,Easy to use,2022-08-24
5,I have shopped at Lidl since they came to Lincoln on Outercircle Road in the Carlton Centre shopping centre. I find that all of the things I want to buy are very good in quality although they are more than likely of a brand that I have never heard of prior to shopping at Lidl for the first time. I have found that their prices are very competitive and found them a lot cheaper than the CO-OP shops in and around my home address and also cheaper than most of the major supermarkets.,2024-01-19
2,Changing the bonus on the app and making you spend more to get less in these harder times bit of a shocker,2022-09-05

High quality products and very good prices!",2021-12-08

4,It is well organized which is a good part. A bad part is too much clicks to get more. Couldn't it be simpler. For example. Bunus could be automatically deducted on purchase. I am a beginner user for the Lidl. It may need a little time to get used to. Negative. It takes time to find goods that was announced sales items.,2022-05-16

5,Very straightforward and easy to use,2022-04-03
3,It's a pity that the vouchers run out so quickly we can't all go to Lidl so often. I rely on others to give me a lift so often miss out even though I rarely shop on other supermarkets,2022-09-16
2,"I wanted to find out the ingredients of products sold at lidl , unlike asda tesco Sainsburys the lidl app is purely a coupon saving app , I'll have to go to lidl ,and stand around trying to find food suitable for me. I just hope not to many customers get annoyed at me reading the ingredients lists.",2023-08-28

5,Easy to access and use,2022-11-14
1,The App is a jumbled up mess. Badly Designed. Badly Thought Out. Vouchers and Rewards Too Often Disappear. The Lidl Plus app needs a serious upgrade.,2022-02-25
5,Kind caring staff a pleasure to shop .And also important now is the price of food 🥑🥝 thank you. .,2023-11-03
5,Good,2022-07-31
4,Not so good sometimes the coupons for money off are not related to your product you buy regularly in an average shop need to give it to specific products that would be on your list of shopping more,2022-08-10
1,I can't active my coupon . Every time I have this message Failed to activate coupon why,2022-11-18
4,"The first time I went for the £100 monthly spend,I thought that I would get £2 taken off my next purchase. I didn't realise that I had to go through a process to validate the voucher then use it within 7 days, so I lost it. That discouraged me from making the extra spend to get further vouchers.",2022-03-10
1,It doesn't reflect my preferences nd rewards don't seem with the effort perhaps works bettfor families,2022-10-21

4,It is quite easy once you get in the habit to use the app however at present I have a notification to Update but when I select this I only get 'open' or 'uninstall' and selecting open just returns you to the notification to 'update'.

5,Very good,2022-03-26
3,"A good app but it's frustrating when coupons are on the app for the same sales area but you can only activate one as the other shows as incompatible. They should all be able to be used, especially when some of them are from scratchcards or from the spend amount rewards",2024-03-10
5,So simple to use,2021-11-18
1,Won't let me register! So I uninstall the re-installed and it still doesn't work! When try to register I can't because I need the last 6 digits of my customer number which I don't have access to and therefore I cannot register!,2021-11-03

1,"Totalno nelogična, komplikovana i nefunkcionalna kopija Maxi aplikacije. Umesto da olakša kupovinu kupcima, traži lične podatke za koje nema zakonski osnov, i ne radi!",2022-05-11
5,Highly recommended for saving money,2022-06-12
3,"Great for Lidl to have an app that offers coupons but they don't last long enough. I won't be back to shop the week after to use them before they expire. Other stores have coupons that last a year. Unrealistic really to be shopping so often, especially with increasing prices.",2022-04-05
5,Very good,2022-01-15
5,"Great savings, brilliant information with digital receipts. My only (small) criticism is having to ""thumb through""the weekly offers magazine, I would prefer to be able to view them as you can on the desktop Lidl site.",2021-12-11

5,Great application,2023-09-07
4,This is a great App. The reward system is so helpful to me by the time I get to the end of the month the £10 off (after spending £200) is perfect for those few extra bits I need before I get paid. The scratch cards online I am usually quite lucky on too!,2021-12-01

5,Scan card done bonus great,2022-07-26
5,Good experience all round,2023-09-05
1,Didn't discount the special German sausages from the coupons on the app.,2022-12-09
3,"Let's be clear about this. Loyalty schemes are for the business, not for the customer. Does this one have benefits? Maybe; the special discounts are real enough but only useful if it's for things you'd buy anyway. The £2 discount at 2 weeks and monthly £10 are real enough. But only if I spend £200/month. In my opinion the spin of surprises is anything but random. Funny how you ' win' the first time but hardly ever after that. And then the reward is a discount on things you don't normally buy.",2021-10-18
4,Great value,2021-11-19
4,Favourite shop but please can you start selling Chinese chicken thighs again,2021-12-28

5,"Lots of things not found in other shops. Great prices. Lots of interesting international things every week. I live 25 miles away but going to LIDL on Wellington Road is something I do to treat myself. Just back. Went for a few things. Spent £81! But among other things I got a whole roasted chicken, a rack of bbq ribbon, a ham hough already cooked for £3.99 and a sma alrea cooke ham for £5.99. And £18 worth of lovely tulips, narcissus, hyacinths, 🪻 🪻 and daffs. Only £1.99 for bag of 8 bulbs",2023-10-05
5,It's a great ap all the free treats. I'm delighted to see an introduction of a choice of food stuff on the scratch and win card. 5 stars,2022-06-25

3,Must be an easier way to get deals. Finding the app then activating coupons and trying to find what it relates too. Has not always been successful,2022-05-20
1,Something changed. The app now wants us to sign in but there is nowhere to do that. The only way is to attempt to activate a coupon. Then the app will offer a login dialogue. However the previously used and stored password no longer works and locks us out after 3 attempts. I give up. I won't hold up the queue any longer.,2021-10-08
2,"Multiple failure right at the checkup Am I the only one to whom this happens, but only with this store's app, 2/3 times I'm at the cash register, it complicates getting to the card qr code, so not to vaste time of others waiting in line, I have to skip it. Is it done on purpose this complicated way? There should always be a button visible - the card... It's not that hard.",2024-01-14

4,"I found it hard getting used to it For a loyalty scheme I'm more familiar to having a card to scan at checkout. But I think it's ok, as long as I keep a check on everything it offers, something I don't always have time to do. Also, most of the coupons aren't really relevant to me.",2022-12-20
5,Super!,2022-04-07
1,"S rostoucím počtem slevových kupónů se aplikace stala nepřehlednou a vyhledávání a aktivování kuponů zpomaluje proces nákupu. Slevy typu na každý den jiná sleva mne přivádějí k šílenství a nevěřím tomu, že přináší nějaké inkrementální tržby navíc.",2023-10-17

1,"Loznika kao da ulazimo u Pentagon. Da li je razvojnom tehničkom timu neko javio da je Tito umro? Zahtevi za lozniku su toliko van kriterijuma da nemam reči, da li mislite da bake i deke mogu da se izbore sa tim? Pa ne ulaze potrošači u Pentagon nego da uzmu kupon za pola kile krompira, krastavac i jogurt!!! P.S. i pored toga što mislite da su ovakve loznike teške za brute force, oh wait, provaljuju se za 24-48h. Dakle čisto maltretiranje korisnika. Back to the drawing board folks!",2022-11-16
1,"Just an app that's made to rush shoppers into spending £100 or £200 a week at their stores, before there ridiculously short time limits run out just to get a measly £2 or £10 coupon, which also has a 7 day time limit in which to use them, basically they want u to spend £200 now to earn a £10 coupon, then next week rush you into using that coupon, whilst spending another £200 to earn the next coupon, don't get caught in their loop this app has GREED written all over it.

5,Wonderful staff-- great deals. Spend a third less at this supermarket for high quality. Only negative is the veg/fruit let it down -- don't last the same!! I lost £50 in store before Xmas -- returned 3 weeks later ( I live 30 mins drive away)-- a lovely male member of staff recognised my hat and came to me -- went to the office and gave me the £50 -- had been handed in after I left! I don't know his name but he is regularly on the tills and is in his 30s? With black hair. Real asset!!,2022-05-12

I spent £53 in Lidl yesterday and couldn't get points added as stuck in this update, and that amount would have taken me to over £100. There should be a button to reject it.

4,App now working well and I am able to see my receipts and add coupons. Though not quite 5 star as the offers no longer seem to be relevent to the products I purchase. I also wish spend amounts rollover each month so you can earn points much like Tesco or Sainsbury's nectar.,2022-09-08

1,"App not fit for purpose. Coupons applied on your Lidl Plus account suddenly ""deactivate"" without warning, meaning that your discount/free food item is not applied at the checkout. The help link on the app seems to be staffed by people who have no idea how to fix the problem. App now uninstalled. Don't waste your time if you're looking to get Lidl discount vouchers, you'll be disappointed.",2023-09-21
3,Great savings - would be 5 star if it didn't need me to be on line to use it. Luckily a screen cap of the card works. Also why do I need to activate the coupons before they can be used? Update: Rewards are significantly reduced now after the £10 coupon was dropped. I always struggled to reach that - now that I don't have to I can split my shopping with Aldi,2022-12-20

Spend £150 and it's a packet of nuts (an Alesto product to be precise). The weekly vouchers for me have been mainly for products I don't buy. There's may be one or two at most I might use but not every week. Used to like the app when it first appeared but not really that rewarding now.,2023-07-24
1,"P'in awful. Vouchers for hitting spending targets timeout after 7 days, no flexibility in when to do your weekend shop. Poor connection in stores can mean missing out on all your savings unless you know to screenshot your voucher Qcode. Scratchcards won't let you exit until you reveal every single letter. And most f'ing annoying of all, being forced to do an app update in store, at the till, with non-existent connection so you can't use the bloody thing. Even staff know it's shite.",2022-01-29

1,It often logs me out. I have made purchases only to find I am logged out at the check out point . I am therefore unable to use the card . I don't always have my phone with me either . I would prefer a plastic card to swipe at the till point,2021-10-25
1,"Horrible app that doesn't autoupdate! When I need to use the card, I can't because the ""need to update"" shows up! 1 star from me!",2024-03-01

3,"Több mint két éve, alapvetően jól működik. De. A korábbi 5*-t 3*-ra rontom,mert ahogy többen írták, minden update-tel rosszabb az app, ami fura fejlődés. Most épp a kedvencek bookmarkja tűnt el minap. Akuponos termékek megtalálása lehetne egyszerűbb. Pl.többféle cikkszámú de ugyanolyan paradicsomok közül csak 1 konkrét akciós, aki nem bújja az eldugott cikkszám és súly infot a részletek közt, az fotó&név alapján nem találja el a jót. Kicsi a zoom az újságban. Házastársaknak közös account?!",2023-09-19

4,It's an OK app but sadly the coupons seem to be mainly for expensive items rather than the run of the mill products I've not had the app that long but it would be improved by copying either the tesco club card or sainsbury nectar point or coop cards which not only gives you money off but the points can be exchanged for cash,2022-03-23

2,"Bei ""Einkaufsliste - Artikel hinzufügen"" werden so gut wie keine Artikel gefunden. Das verschieben beim zoomen der Angebotsprospekte funktioniert auch nicht richtig.

5,"Fantastic App. I have saved so much money with this app. I shop at Lidl every week so I'm very pleased to receive a £12 discount every month. To all the moaners, there's no reason for the discount to remain on the app. For most stores you'd have to shop for six months, if not more to get a discount like that. The coupons are often relevant to me and I often win on the scratchcards too. There seems to be a slight bug atm with the app asking me to update when no update is available though.",2022-02-25

5,Love it just remembering my phone is my issue now lol,2022-09-14
2,The app takes too long to open and logs people out often. Can you PLEASE add a button to activate all coupons and also make a home screen barcode widget!!! This will save staff a heap of time. So many people have given up on the app because it's a faff and they can't be bothered any more.,2023-12-13
4,We enjoy Shopping at Lidl but if we have spent 200 pounds say two weeks before the month ends we will shop at Aldi as Lidl spending rewards not reset till the following month So with no further incentive being offered when the target has been set Lidl could be losing out on a lot of custom I suspect The £2 and £10 rewards having to be claimed in seven days or be lost is also very annoying,2022-04-04
1,"The app always freezes..when your in store, u can't get to your lidl card as it doesn't come up and as your staff are so rude and unhelpful on several occasions it wouldn't scan my card so what's the point to having your card when u get a free item because this app does not work properly you get charged for your (free item) !!!! but you clearly don't care or your rude staff, which is why I don't use your store as often as a lot of people we are fed up of the non-existent service ...disgraceful.",2023-09-02

3,Ok app to use easy enough but the change in rewards is disappointing I use Lidl regularly every week for shopping you used to spend 200 for 10pounds off monthly now it's went up to 250 a month for a 10per cent discount which isn't great as I don't spend anything near 100 in one shop to get the 10 pound with 10 per cent rewards and prizes are always the same and not on anything you would even purchase mostly I don't see the point in the using the app anymore for the 10per cent discount unhappy,2022-11-01

1,Takes too long to register the spend. Gives the impression that has not worked. End up querying with staff and then just having to wait for it to ? refresh?. Should be a quick response so customer is reassured that it has worked.,2022-08-25

5,Good application,2023-01-20
3,Normally very good and easy to use. However 2 days ago it is consistently telling me to renew app and no matter what I do it will not load my £2/£10 voucher line. I am now up to and beyond £200 spending and have had no satisfactory helpful or useful answer from you. I would like my £10 voucher. Other vouchers come up but not the most valuable one.

2,"You don't get much time to use any discount coupons, unlike tesco where you can let them build up which is much more helpful",2022-06-30
5,Handy discounts and rewards . Also now better as if you forget your phone if you give them the mobile number registered with the app they can add your purchase onto the app. So not an issue that they can't be added retrospectively,2022-08-16
3,Disappointed.,2022-04-30

5,What's not to like.,2022-09-29
2,"As of now, when using the app at the till or self checkout, you won't get a receipt and the issue is that most self checkouts in the Lidl stores near me seem to fail to register and reflect my shopping in my app. So in the case I do self checkout and use my app I get no receipt(nor physical or digital) and on my app it doesn't show coupon progress.",2022-12-10

2,Takes up to much space on my phone,2021-11-18
1,why do I need to activate offers one by one ? why do I even need to activate offers ? if there is an offer just give the discount at the till without customer having to waste time looking and activating in the app Edit : to answer your questions I do not use E-receipts and Lidl Pay 30-day return existed before the application I use this app only for special offers but I don't see why an app is needed for that so yes my negative review applies to the whole application,2022-07-04

1,I don't understand why you don't carry forward points to the next month and so on like Tesco does. Also why do you have to lose your points if you don't save it Tesco makes it easy for people to use their reward card as you get it no matter how long you keep it Also most of the early people don't use mobile phone hence they are losing out on points why don't you give people Care to use like other supermarket does,2022-04-01

5,I love it a lot but unfortunately I have experienced the same things as Julia Smith mentioned in her rating. I had bought groceries for 160€ on a month when you can get double bonuses for each purchase. And the cashier told me it finally took the card after two tries. But not even after 48h did I ever receive my double bonuses. So I contacted the customer service and they told me the best they could do was give me a 5€ discount off my next purchase. This sucked and I was so disappointed.,2021-11-28

1,I'm currently living in Hungary. I'm not able to set the app in English,2022-02-13
1,Actual App poorly explained and offers totally irrelevant. Actual cash incentive poor and when money taken off the bill totally confusing as it is taken off individual items instead of total. Computer Program!!,2022-03-11

5,I'm 65 if I can easily use the app everyone can.,2022-05-18
3,Spend 100 in a month I live alone and you give us a £2 voucher wow another store gives you £2 50 per £25 spent a little bit better I think also just in west brom and 6 tills all shut so a queue of 30 people at self serve what a joke,2022-03-01
4,Fantastic,2024-02-19
2,When logged in great but. 5 mins resetting password because it had logged me out while standing to try and pay with people huffing and puffing behind me. Went from 5 stars to 2,2022-04-19
5,Brilliant app and store,2022-03-01
3,"App is OK, but checkout staff never remind you to use the card. I used to work in retail and we always asked customers if they had their loyalty card. Also vouchers shouldn't expire so soon. Some people can't afford to shop that many times a month and perhaps just want to be able to use the vouchers whenever they want. Perhaps a 6 months expiry? Or an opportunity to store them so customers can have a splurge?",2022-01-29
3,"You can't scan the products for price...every other retailer has this function. App is useful only for the few (and not very interesting) promos. Lacks personalisation, because retailer wants to sell you specific products, not things that you would actually need/buy often.",2022-09-13

2,i always liked reaching a monthly spend of 200 and then getting a £10 voucher. you have now changed the rules so that it is not worthwhile anymore. I am now shopping more at other supermarkets.,2022-09-15
5,So Easy!,2022-07-16
5,I would like to see the coupons tailored towards previous shopping habits as the coupons would be more likely to be used.,2022-08-17
3,"Easy app to use, sometimes doesn't always open when checking out. The app needs updating occasionally to fix bugs etc, but when you agree to update on the app it just constantly keeps whirring around for hours trying to update. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times. Annoying when checking out trying to scan the barcode and nothing happens at the checkout, lots of awkward stares in the que 😡",2022-04-11
4,Cannot update as I keep being asked to uninstall vital apps. Deleted sizeable NHS app but still no room despite only 9 gigs of space used out of 40. Today 12/3/22 I activated coupon for chef select pies but did not get 15 per cent discount. Scanner charged me full £1.39 price.,2022-03-12

5,Great fresh groceries at good prices,2022-02-25
1,"This is an app for giving big discounts to big spenders. As a pensioner I'm a small spender, so I'll never get a discount. Worse, if I shop at Lidl I'll be subsidising the big spender's big discounts. I'll never go back to Lidl, ever. Pitty, used to be a regular customer.",2022-06-17

1,Removing 10.00 not good people with low budget use lidl and 10 was a reward you are now favouring wealthy grabbing the family of 4 they will spend 100 and earn 10 the poor lucky now to get 2.00. Old saying you look after your regulars customer they look after you Shame on you during cost of living crisis lidl and to be fair a store beginning with W are offering me 4.00 when I spend 20 got 8 vouchers using them now,2022-09-22
5,Love shopping in Lidl xxx,2022-01-25
1,"Disappointing app, english is not available in Luxembourg and Coupons can not be activated.",2021-11-04
3,So far so good... All working fine. Update after using this app for some time: Coupons need to be valid for longer. I tend to do a really big shop every 2 weeks and rarely get to use my money off coupons. Also it would be great to integrate your car park management system so customers can confirm preloaded number plates with their shop instead of having to scan and type on the terminals. Reduced from 5 stars to 3 because of the coupon issue.,2021-11-18

5,The great,2022-04-06
4,"Vouchers expire too quickly to use. Great I thought, £12 off if I spend £200 a month. Except you can't use the vouchers if you go shopping once a week, because they expire in 7 days, just before you get there for the next weekly shop. Change the 7 day expiry to at least 14 and it would actually be worth it. Edit- looks like vouchers now last 8 days, do can be used for the weekly shop, 14 days would be better, but much improved, thanks.",2022-05-11
2,"Asks you to verify email, then goes on a cycle of taking you to a page to down load the app, which you have just used. Also coupons only valid 5 day which is useless and just a marketing ploy. Who wants to shop. More than once a week. To get points you have just 11 days to reach a £200 spend. All I can say is its Pointless, have uninstalled. One if the most disappointing experiences, I expected better from Lidl.",2022-05-21

2,Why not just have cheaper prices instead of wasting money on this app.,2023-08-17
1,Awful. Been trying for a year to add my account. All it says is 'there has been an error'. I know the app works fine for my daughter. But it will not work on phone. We've both tried.,2022-01-29

5,"Just updated the app. and I won £20 off £20 shop, all I can say is WOW!",2022-07-01
1,Great to see your receipt etc but a lot of hassle for very little rewards. A free bakery item is not worth all the investment in scanner etc. It great to see the feedback please don't have an expired date on the free gifts. I can see why but if you can't get back to store. it's more of putting than having nothing. I regularly shop in-store weekly and spend about a £100 but you get home put your shopping away check the receipt to find you have a vouchers that expires. So frustrating,2022-10-28

The selected products in the catalog disappear from the list after the publication of the new catalog and it is no longer possible to select them in the currently active catalog, but only in the catalog for the next week, so the functionality has become useless. 2. Bonus coupons that you win by purchasing over a certain amount disappear after just a few days and you lose that benefit. 3. ..... I will not use it any more...",2023-09-08

1,App keeps automatically logging me out. It's no fun having 10 other customers behind you at the cash register hurling insults at you because the app devs can't do their job. Neither is having customer service regurgitating platitudes and blaming you for a problem which clearly rests in the Lidl IT department. Listen to your customers. Or at least the poor employees of your customer service line.,2022-02-18

1,"Ontzettend irritant dat dit is ingevoerd. Mensen staan bij de kassa constant te klungelen met deze app en dan sta je samen met 3 andere klanten achter je dom te wachten. App is alleen maar gedoe en heeft geen enkele toegevoegde waarde voor mij als klant. Lidl was goedkoop en had goede aanbiedingen en ok hier gebruik van te kunnen maken moet ik nu ineens aanbiedingen activeren via een app..? Waardeloos idee, merk dat ik steeds vaker naar de AH ga sinds invoering van deze app.",2021-12-04

3,Filled in information to sign in won't send code number getting frustrated with this,2022-03-09
2,The app in itself is ok. Need to click every coupons separately which is a drag. Discounts offered only in small amounts to typically stuff is already gone when you get there.,2023-02-09
5,If you're shopping in store what's not to like about getting rewards 👍,2021-10-24
3,Great idea in principle...sometimes! My main problem is the rollover of my earned discount vouchers £2 & £10. Does not carry over into the following month. Lost out too many times. My other gripe is lately when I try to use my app access my loyalty card I often find it difficult to get online when I'm inside the store. Are you using signal blockers? I've not been able to collect or claim discount vouchers when I'm at the till...😕,2022-02-21

5,On the whole very good but I don't think it is fair to all customers as a lot of people (my daughter set mine up)myself included don't find doing things online very easy or don't have the Internet or have a up to date phone they can access the apps.

Grebalica stigne ko zna kad, ne odmah posle kupovine, pa posle kad vidim poruku, ona je istekla. Verovatno loša realizacija dobre ideje. Svakako ""pokloni"" nemaju veze sa onim što inače kupujem, pa ne kapiram čemu aplikacija koja prikuplja podatke, kada te iste podatke ne koristite da pružite personalizovano iskustvo.

5,Great app .. easy to use .,2021-10-07
2,Used to be quite good but the change to the coupons means its pretty pointless now. £10 off was a good incentive and was the main reason for using the app but changing it to 10% and increasing the amount you have to spend to get it is a bit of a piss-take. The weekly offers are generally for items that are no use to the majority of people and the scratchcard coupons are even more obscure.,2022-09-16

2,After using the app for a few years I cannot log on. The app just does not work. I miss havuing digital receipts.,2022-01-27
2,Vouchers are pretty useless. Don't last long enough as I can't go back to the store every other day. Better to invest in reducing que times and some where to load a bag at a till if you use a basket. Bending down to the floor to fill shopping bags not ideal,2022-10-31

3,I like the idea of collecting points and of weekly vouchers that give me better prices. All the vouchers I get though are absolutely useless and for things I have never bought and will never buy in my life. It would be nice if the vouchers were personalised based on what I buy so I can actually use them.,2022-02-23

1,"Vouchers you gain last for days. After a large £200 shop I don't need to go back again withing 6-7 days, so discounts offered are pointless.

It was rejected during early part of registration, got right to the end only to find its forced on me with the wording used. Sod that lidl I have got far better things to do than have you share my info with google and meta without clear, proper and transparent opt out. It makes me not trust your intentions and makes me feel you are actually abusing my personal data. Now Uninstalled",2024-02-21

1,I used to save £12 a month on my shopping and told everyone that it was well worth going to shop at LIDL. Unfortunately this has all changed. The £200 spend when you then got a £10 voucher has gone and been replaced with 10% off your shopping when you have spent £250 in a month. So you now have spend £100 to get a tenner off. Also when you reach £150 instead of getting free cleaning product you get a bar of chocolate. No real incentive now. Once I get my £2 coupon will shop elsewhere.,2022-12-10
2,"Used to like this app, but each change makes it worse, the latest eviscerating it by removing it's best feature, the £10 coupon. To cover that loss you now have to spend a extra £50 to get a 10% off voucher and then do a single £100 shop (not including alcohol). The current terrible stocking levels and lack of variety at Lidl, makes it hard to imagine what to spend £100 on in one shop. The new coupon at £150 spend doesnt nearly cover it, and I am no longer sure if the app is really worth it.",2022-09-21

5,It used to have instant update of purchase after receipt but now it is taking more than two hours for update which is quite frustuating.,2022-03-28
1,App fails to update often; coupons have to be manually added; leaflets fail to appear; you can't see the full range of goods; privacy concerns. *Update (11 April 2022)* Stock response from the developer. The primary issues are flaws inherent in the design of the app.,2022-04-11

1,"Won't open because it wants to be updated , but no option to update it in play store only an option to open it which brings you back to not opening because it wants an update. After posting this review .....it opened . ..... Very hard to actually get the ""offers"" the app says you have. The particular products on your offer are very rarely available, in this case there should be an alternative available. Overall a very poor app. Stopped using vapp. It's pointless",2024-01-25
1,"""Activarea"" de cupoane este greoaie, trebuie sa derulezi 2 pagini la fiecare sa vezi pretul redus - nu e nevoie de 2 pagini decat ca sa-ti ia cat mai mult timp.. si devine oricum inutil cand casierul nu are timp sa te intrebe de card sau nu are rabdare sa-l scanezi. Ce sens are butonul de dezactivare?!! Aplicatia e mai mereu plina de cupoane neactivabile decat peste ""n"" zile. Nu poti vedea toate produsele Lidl, nu se poate comanda online.. Arata mai degraba a joc pentru copii.",2023-11-19
1,Made to be very complicated.It made to make the life of their customets difficult. Better to check with other compatitors to see how they do it. Asking you to activate their aplication but you need wifi and they dont provide at their stores!!,2022-03-31

5,Great to use for great savings Top app,2023-07-25
1,"Same issue as others, the cash register beeps for confirmation that the card was validated but the coupons don't register at all. Just remove the coupon option, it's such a hassle. The other time the cashier asked me to list her all the coupons activated to make sure they're approved. It's cumbersome for other people to wait and for your employees to stress over it. The app is useless because it can't serve its base function. I'm less inclined to shop there because of faulty systems.",2021-10-25

Was it in prepackaged cakes, fresh bakery, biscuits, Lidl offers shelf, or other location? I wasted 10 minutes of my life for nothing. 3) Needing to Activate offers before purchase is an inconvenience. Easy to make a mistake or forget. 4) Font size too small (so if I don't have my reading glasses in the car, ita no use)",2021-11-21

I like the fact you can see the magazines and plan when to shop around when there is anything exciting in the middle of lidl. Ap is really easy and nice to use. Only annoying thing is that if you forget to scan before you pay, you can't log it afterward! Really frustrating if you do a big shop and it doesn't get counted towards your target for money off next shop.",2021-11-26

4,Its a good app part from you can neva get any phone signal in the shop to use the app 😑 x,2022-07-28
5,The app is easy to use but the coupon has a very short time spam in which you can use it. What is even more disappointing is having finally won on the scratch cardyou only to get few pennies off expensive items so pointless and useless. Thanks for the good prices and clean bright shops but please don't lower your standards with pity full scratch cards or short times in order to use the coupon.,2021-11-14

1,App says my local store opens at 0700am - get down there and it opens at 1000am - on the Lidl plus app you have to click more on the page which says your local store opens at 0700am and then it gives you the real actual opening hours of your local store - thanks a lot Lidl for adding to the carbon footprint of the world! Surely an app developer and Lidl should know and have updated this already!,2022-01-01

1,"Two phones, installed and uninstalled repeatedly and still my coupons will not activate. I've noe given up.",2022-03-31
1,"Poorly thought out, in that the local Lidl in Peckham is built like a Faraday cage, meaning you can't load the app to access the card. Allowing this to be loaded into the Google wallet would solve that. The ""paperless receipt"" doesn't work either, as after running around trying to get enough signal to load the QR code, the self-service machine still printed a receipt. As others have mentioned, the scanning of the QR code is slow",2023-07-15

Type in Banbridge and it goes to the map, then nothing. Cannot go any further. Can't get to the scan section, coupons nor the flyers. This app is broken and useless.

Personally, I don't like using my phone, getting out of my bag, to log on, open up, scan ....and I'm sure the people in the queue behind me are not thrilled with the delay. A simple card to scan would beach quicker.",2022-08-20

5,Good,2024-01-14
4,"App is good but offers really quite restrictive in terms of time limits. I was a fan. I'm beginning to feel as if the process is really quite cynical and not a genuine loyalty programme. A free 59p chocolate bar for £150 pound spend? The £10 voucher for £250 was replaced with 10% but dated from hitting the £250 spend. I've just seen mine and I now have 3 days to use it.

5,Overall app is great. the registration process could be better when done natively in the app instead of webviews. The best feature is the digital receipts. I think every super market should follow Lidl in this regard. Would be great to have payback as well though :D,2022-08-30

1,"Waste of time. I have installed this app twice, and both worked the first time, but never again. The scanners at the tills just don't recognise it. The first time, I thought it may be due to the phone, but it is the same with my new one. The app does send vouchers for discounts and free items, but as the scanners don't read the lidl card, they don't work. It can be sorted, but don't like to trouble the staff as they are busy. I like the option of paperless receipts, but that doesn't work either.",2023-05-19

1,"An elaborate scam run by the lidl corporation. The app is crashing all the time. Many stores in Ireland do not accept Lidl plus as they say ""the system is down"". Even if i get a coupon, i activate it and go to the store to get the item, when I get home i realise i actually didn't get the discount.",2023-03-02

4,Not Simple.,2021-12-21
3,If you shop at Lidl regularly it's sensible to have this app. I have found it's possible to miss the scanner at checkout due to too much background noise or maybe the software. Annoying that offers are usually for stuff you never buy or maybe the most expensive things. Then if you decide you want that offer the stock is limited. However overall Lidl is the best value around.,2022-08-25

2,"Hello Lidl Plus team,it is very disappointing to see that in the section of language selection, except for the chosen country, there is no other language to choose from and it would be very conscientious of you,to provide us with a language option, I should be able to choose what language I want to use in the application, instead by default I am stuck with the chosen country language, so what is the point for the language selection option, please let us choose what language we want to use.",2021-11-09

Don't get me wrong - it's a good thing they're there, because you never know when there's another pandemic... It's usually a pain in the **** to reach the QR-reader with your phone (because of the glass). But, if you're hunting for bargain prices I suppose that's the price you have to pay... 😉",2024-03-21

1,"To be perfectly honest, it's a waste of time. You have to spend vast amounts of money to get anything worthwhile back and to make it worse it's time limited. I'm never likely to spend enough in the requisite period to get anything back. Maybe if you're shopping for a family of 6... Overcomplicated and pointless. What's wrong with a straightforward point for every pound spent, that you can exchange for money off your shopping when you've collected enough.",2022-10-14

4,"You have lost your way with Lidl plus. I favour return to modest prices for good products, which is fair for all customers. People without recent mobile phones are excluded from the benefits, while some of us using the app delay the checkout fumbling with disappearing QRs etc. Many of your special offers are irrelevant to us, because we try to avoid sweets and instant foods. The new £10+ raffle should give 3 stars for a £35 basket. It seems to encourage several £10-£11 shops rather than a few bi",2022-01-13

They offer an item for free, like a shower gel. NOT GOOD ANYMORE! Just spend what u can afford on ur essential shop, DON'T try to spend higher to complete ""Milestones"" Edit... 07 March 2024 Now if u spend £250 in 1 month u get 10% discount off next shop. £250 is allot to spend to just get 10% off, at least give 30% OFF! 🤦",2024-03-08

2,The last 3 times I've been to my local Lidl the app hasn't been working even though it bleeps at the checkout. When I asked the staff they were particularly unhelpful and I'm beginning to think maybe I should take my custom elsewhere. As for the lost 3 transactions I was told as the server is down that money will not go on to your monthly total. Very unsatisfactory.,2022-04-20

2,"Although the app works technically well on an Android phone, it needs to be redesigned in terms of content. It would be better if the list of most items in the store could be viewed and selected in the app. It would be much better if the goods were listed in a categorized way.

3,"It is okay, easy to use, but you need to spend quite a bit to get any rewards",2022-11-17
3,"The Lidl Rewards Scheme is pretty bad as you need to be a frequent spender to actually earn anything of value, in addition to their scratchcards either being losses or vouchers for the most obscure of products... Would be nice to see a program similar to other companies in which you earn money off vouchers while spending and can redeem at any time during other shops. App is good for loading times and ease of use however.",2022-09-16
1,"Doesn't work and a waste of time contacting them, as they never sort it out. Oh good, app not working again, after more updates- sort it out Lidl!",2022-02-03
5,"this is just a simple rewards app for a DISCOUNT retailer not a points system it's just a rewards app for getting money off your shopping trips by scanning a digital card that records your shopping trip spends to get £12 off a £200 shop every month and thats besides any other coupon or scratchcard win its just a little thanks for shopping with lidl - works best if lidl is where you do your big shop, not worth it if you hardly visit lidl as you won't be hitting your monthly reward targets in time",2022-06-07

1,"Terrible app You get to the checkout to scan it and every single time you open it and select card to scan it, it has various popups that take 10 seconds to cycle through so you're left standing there like an idiot as the staff scan your shopping at a million miles an hour. The offers are also terrible. Needs redesigning.",2022-10-21
4,"Honestly, I've had no major problems with the app. All the coupons, once activated, work really well, the digital receipts are a brilliant idea and our local Lidl have recently installed Wi-Fi so no issues with signal. Only issue I now have is that I can no longer screenshot my Lidl Plus Card and send it to my other half to do any shopping!",2021-10-28
5,"Liebes Lidl-Team, ich möchte euch gerne ein positives Feedback zur Lidl Plus App geben. Ich bin wirklich sehr zufrieden damit! Die App bietet viele tolle Angebote und sogar kostenlose Produkte, was wirklich fantastisch ist. Besonders hat mich eine besondere Überraschung erreicht, als ich für den 2. Geburtstag meines Sohnes einkaufen war. Er bekam ein Überraschungsgeschenk, und das hat ihn natürlich mega glücklich gemacht. Dafür möchte ich mich von Herzen bei euch bedanken!

1,So far I have not been able to work out how to use this app!,2021-11-19
3,If you have a big family the app. Is good because you spend more and get money back. I buy for two so it's impossible to spend that amount in a month or more . I've only ever got a free bakery item. Not much of a reward.,2022-05-30

Saved me money overall though, now I only shop for necessities-1,2 items and I'v deleted the app. Your steaks are still numero uno though",2021-10-28
1,"Your usual quickly and badly designed loyalty app. Most annoying is that if you don't use the app in a while, it will log you out and when you then stand at the register, you'll suddenly find yourself logged out so you have to start fiddling with the app and your password manager while people behind you in the queue are waiting... Reply to dev reply: If the review is in English you should reply in English and not in some random other language! We use the app only because of the digital receipts.",2023-03-06

5,Crashes since last update when I start the app.,2022-01-29
5,Was a very slick operation which worked trouble-free every time from the outset until 24th Feb 2022 when an update message was displayed.

4,"Great app removing the need for my postbox to get jammed with commercials. Here, in Sweden, all coupons and stuff works fine. I am missing two features though: 1. Being able to scan an item barcode in the store to check the price 2. Creating a shopping list that I can keep and share with e.g. my spouse. Grocery shopping isn't really my greatest priority in life so I keep forgetting what I wanted to get this week Also when my spouse logs in I get kicked out from the app and vice versa - thus 4*",2021-11-09

1,"Useless. I installed the app to make use of of coupons. When you do earn a voucher worth using, you forget to use it because you need to activate the coupon to use it. To add insult to injury, the coupons are only valid for a short period of time. I like lidl, but this app is a marketing ploy and doesnt deliver value to anyone ive spoken to about it.. Uninstalled, it is not worth my time.",2023-01-19

1,"Do not trust anything this app says. Even the offers it claims to offer aren't that great, but then the coupons only work when they feel like it, and the store don't do anything to work around the problem. Sometimes that app doesn't work at all, particularly when you lose internet signal (which nearly always happens inside the Lidl store!) which makes it completely redundant. Assume none of the offers or coupons will work and you will avoid disappointment.",2022-04-28

1,"They shouldn't have bothered, it's not a positive experience nor is it worth the space on your phone. It has to be the worst store coupon app ever. Then they changed it for something less valued to customers. Pathetic woke management idea that's annoyed the bejesus out of me. Coupons only valid for 7 days is another pathetic non customer focused idea. They are trying to tick a box, but falling well short of what a shop reward scheme should resemble.",2022-09-21
5,Good App. Real quality savings. Regularly use the suggestions in Coupons. The £2 and £10 coupons essentially give you a 6% saving on shopping up to £200. I wish they would introduce another money voucher beyond the £200 mark. One one till in my local Lidl it is common for the App not to Scan properly so loosing out on building up your balance. Make sure you check before paying.,2021-12-16

1,"Lidl plus has Upgraded from BAD to WORST. They have remove the free £10 voucher you get when you spend over £200 in a month, instead they introduce a stupid 10% voucher, which means you must spend over £100 at a go before you can benefit from it. And it's not possible to spend over £100 in just Lidl as they don't have Variety of products like other shops like Tesco's, Sainsbury and ASDA. I think it's better LIDL should shut down this App completely rather than using it to make people get upset",2022-10-05

2,"I love the digital receipts and can be emailed to yourself and improvement would be to automatically back up all receipts to email. I have to change my review because the spinning wheel was really awful and the scratch rewards are totally rubbish and you will be lucky if you get 1 in 5. I liked the old offers where they'd give you £2 and 50p off often than these terrible prizes. Other thing is you cant give them feed back for missing products or how to improve, Sorry lidl but have to improve",2022-04-09

5,"Clean, helpful. Great selection of goods. 100%",2022-03-19
2,"Good app, but the activation of coupons instead of automatic discount when scanning the card is such a bad idea. I always forget it so I create massive lines at the till. It's pretty embarrassing. No other card had this disadvantage. Also the coupons expire and than i think i bought it at a discount, but didn't. The explanation of why this system is used is a clear lie. I can choose discounted products myself just fine, by not buying them. Which makes me consider deleting the app altogether.",2023-06-12

1,£2.00 and £10.00 reward has been bumped up from having to spend £100 to £200 a month. The real issue is they make you spend it in an alloted time frame which is way to short. I lost my first one over the Christmas period because they were shut. They've just turned into another big money grabbing supermarket. Not worth the agro!,2021-12-30

Some shelves empty due to picking problems, again not so with other supermarkets. Even so, I regularly spend £200 due to higher prices. Put this up to £300 and give a £15 off voucher. After I've spent £200 at Lidl I start to use Aldi and others Money off vouchers rarely cover the products I buy. The evening bakery is not much use",2022-06-02

Where back when they first.launched it it was very decent. The shopping reward markers are now even worse, used to get £10 off your shopping a d now it's 10percent.

Brilliant for people like me who can only afford to shop weekly. Now it's 10% off next shop when you spend £250 in one month. I spend around £25-£30 a week, so £2.50 off my next shop not £10 - big difference. Also, I will struggle to spend £250 in any one month.

Then you have to MANUALLY activate each of them. In case you don't want to use already activated coupon, you have no choice but to use it next time, as during the payment they are suddenly used automatically! AND they expire really fast. The last straw was not being able to use the app without update at a counter.",2022-04-22

1,"Now even more rubbish points system... Nothing like its competitors. After achieving rewards you have 7 days to use the coupons! Elsewhere you spend at your leisure. Used to be acceptable when you got £10 to spend eventually in anything. Now you get 10% off and only 7 days to use it; so to reach the £10, as before, you're forced into spending even more money with them, extorting customers rather than rewarding them! I'll be shopping elsewhere mostly now! Just had generic reply. Poor show Lidl!",2022-10-31

4,"Good, quick, uncomplicated. Gives bargains, but not too many! (Much better app than Morrison's or Tesco's). The final 10% off closure would be better at the end of the month to use at the begining of the next. Or maybe back-dated? Some problem if you return an item you had 10% discount on - you lose the discount on the replacement. Purchases sometimes take too long to register. The little freebies could be more varied.

3,Fed up with the coupon always stuff I wouldn't use Try looking to see what people buy and gear the coupons to what they buy . Also not happy with the goal post moving to gain any decent money off. I don't shop so much at Lidl as you've never got the things I need where's the lidal coke and that's.just one thing there are too many others to name no wonder Aldi is always busy come up you need to step your game up,2022-10-17
4,"It's ok and considering the prices etc. Suppose it's reasonable. But I do wish they would perhaps put more healthy items as treats for instance I got a free package of malted milk biscuits........I would never buy and not healthy.

Perhaps something to incentivise.",2022-10-29

5,The app.is great But as I don't know anyone who has won anything from you guys you may want ro look for another incentive for shoppers to keep coming back to you especially since prices are going up everywhere.. Lidl are not as cheap as they used to be my 40 pound shop is now 60pound which is the same in Asda so is it really worth coming to you guys!!,2021-11-04

1,I hate having to fiddle with phone at checkout when Im already fully occupied unpacking trolley to conveyor belt and then packing. Also my phone is PAYG so I dont keep it on so such abloody nuisance not having a plastic store card and having to get phone out and mobile wifi switched on as Lidl plus doesnt work if phone wifi off. Also most offers are not things I want to buy.,2022-04-27
5,"The staff in Lidls Edenbridge have absolutely amazing staff. Samantha, Grace, Chris, Andre, Dan and Chris are to name but a few. I have made several calls to head office, asking them to thank the staff (I have dates and names of the people) this is going back to may 2021. And as of today, I have continually asked the staff if they have received their praise? NO THEY HAVE NOT!!!

Password complexity requirements are outrageous, this is not a banking software! 2. Downloaded images are horrible in the discount catalog, the text is sometimes barely readable. 3. The current offers page doesn't list all the contents of the currently valid discount catalog, only the special Lidl Plus offers. Ps: I'm using this app from Hungary.",2023-01-26

5,It would be better if the £2 and £10 didn't expire after 7 days as I don't always shop on the same day each week and lose the voucher. I shop in Lidl every week. Also it would be good to have £250 and £300 monthly targets for vouchers,2022-07-15
5,"Easy to use, no messing with plastic cards the app on your phone is much better.",2022-06-23
4,Generally a good app which is very easy to use. I would only say that the vouchers could be valid for a little longer as I don't always have the money or manage to get back in there within the next week. Being valid for a couple of weeks or even 10 days or so would be better.,2022-04-08
3,"Sum of the items or coupons are of no interest, however you can not delete them until they expire and you have to trawl through them every time you sign in and I have purchased items that I thought l've activated to later find that I hadn't which is frustrating also having to redeem vouchers within 7days is a nuisance in particular the 10% off next shop voucher sometimes it is more convenient to shop on day 8 or 9 however if you do that you lose the offer.

3,The app is a good idea but when you reach £100 mark you don't get enough time to use it. And if I reach the target it doesn't activate at the till unless I go outside the store which is too late to take off . Then when I go back the following week I have lost that £2 voucher.,2021-11-18

1,"Dass man trotz scannen der App die beworbenen Rabatte nicht bekommt, wenn man die Coupons nicht aktiviert, grenzt an Betrug. Bei Kaufland, Edeka und co. reicht die Kundenkarte und die Coupons sind zusätzlich. Hier wird suggeriert, dass das scannen der App ausreichen würde und dann darauf spekuliert, dass man die Aktivierung der Coupons vergisst. So zahlt man im Zweifelsfall den Originalpreis und Lidl greift trotzdem die Daten ab. Dubiose, verwerfliche Geschäftspraxis.",2024-02-02

1,"I think it's the worst loyalty card out there. Better have nothing than this. If I do a big shop and qualify for any rewards, they expire in 7 days. I just spent £200, I'm not coming back in 7 days which means the whole reward system is pointless. Also they keep advertising for products that aren't even in the store close to me. Thank you for a wasted trip. Also the coupons are for items I never buy or never be inclined to buy, I hardly think I used the coupons for stuff I actually buy.",2023-06-21

2,"Ta aplikacja mnie wylogowuje po każdej aktualizacji. Zwykłe to odkryję w sklepie przy kasie. Czegoś takiego nie potrzebuję. Edit - answer to the developer: I have many apps on my phone, like banking apps, apps for managing tickets, Google Pay. I don't believe those are any less secure than the Lidl app, and none of those apps log me out after an update. Also - what is so security sensitive about a supermarket app?

Possible solutions: no sign in at all, sign in with eID, face recognition. In any case the option to scan should be available OFFline all the time. Developers should really validate their new products before launching them. I have now uninstalled the app: annoying and not creating any value for me.",2022-04-17

5,Like lidl prices not too keen on our local store,2022-04-06

5,Love shopping here very good value for money,2022-05-14
1,I used to think that the app was excellent especially rewarding you with £10 off your shopping when you spent £200 in store over a month To take this away during a time that people are experiencing so many increases in their spending is not what I would call good customer service,2022-11-02

1,When there is an update and there is no way to log in on the app,2022-01-20
1,"Possibly the worst loyalty scheme going.... especially when it tells you you have to update the app and won't let you go any further until you do...... standing there at the till, holding up everyone while you try and download the update! You can't add on pounds/points from a receipt later, so that purchase is lost! 'Coupons' are always for items we never buy! Spin game 'loses' every time. Scratchcard... same! £2 and £10 vouchers have to be used within 7 days 🤬 The app is a farce!",2021-09-30

I am struggling to think of a reason for keeping this app on my phone.",2023-10-17

So if you move to e.g. Netherlands, good luck using the app. It won't allow English, only the selected country's language, in this case Dutch. Going to vacation to Hungary? Good luck then learning one of the hardest language. Useless app.",2022-10-23

5,Great app,2022-04-14
1,Complete con. Does not work properly and loses vouchers and does not record spends. Have uninstalled it as it is utterly pointless. Last week despite activating all the coupons it 'deactivated' them and today it has not recorded my £60 plus spend meaning I've lost the discount voucher too. Very disappointing. Feb 2022: App says update needed but there is no update available! Still shocking poor.,2022-02-25

3,Very good,2022-02-16
4,We spend on average £300 per month on groceries. I note that Lidl sell items for years. Then suddenly no longer stock it. The latest Is NIXe Herring Fillets in a sauce. I really hope you will inform me you will be restocking the above. You may think I'm over reacting. I'll have to dump Lidl completely. That's how much I love NIXE canned Herring fillets.,2022-08-03

2,"Just a waste of time I'm a vegan so I do have some bias here, as their vegan range is pathetic (aldi is MUCH better). But specifically with regards to their app? You have to spend so much money to get the most pathetic of results. Only worth it if you already spend an obscene amount at Lidl stores, consistently, every month. Otherwise? Don't bother. You won't even spend any money or get any benefits. Because they don't actually care about benefitting the user, they just want ""something new"".",2022-09-21

3,"Es gibt Einblick in den aktuellen Prospekt und ein paar zukünftige. Das ""Durchblättern"" ist jedoch umständlich. Es sind im Grunde nur die eingescannten Print-Prospekte. Das Loyalty-Programm bietet Rabatte, jedoch muss man alles umständlich durchscrollen und anwählen. Warum nicht wie bei Edeka einfach auf die (wenigen) App-Specials pauschal den Rabatt geben, warum muss man Kunden, die bereits ihre Daten freiwillig hergeben, für die paar Cents so herabwürdigend behandeln?",2023-09-22

3,"Slows down the shopping process. Tokens and vouchers don't last long enough to benefit. Update: it's improving but still slow. Sorry but a card would have been better with the discounts applied automatically. Quite often there is no signal in the shops so impossible to use quickly. Still agree with my original thoughts. If the benefits only last a few days, they aren't worth having. With fuel costs, I try not to shop too often. Work doesn't allow it for many.",2022-10-13

1,"Used to be good. But for the last 6 times I've been to Lidl it only registered once, despite saying on the screen that the card is accepted. So I paid more for items that should have been discounted through coupons, I didn't reach the limit for the money off coupons. What's the point of having it then? Nothing.",2021-12-11

I have sent email and also contacted them using online form, but they have ignored my complaint. Pathetic app and cust. service.",2022-05-26

4,App repeatedly crashes. Lidl IT dept working on it. Rewards are ongoing and include cash off shopping at till. Before visiting the store I always check and ensure the app offers and discount coupons are activated ( although I'm not sure why that has to be done and is not automatic ). On entering the store I open the app to ensure connection before shopping. Have never had a problem with the app yet. Of course there are occasions when items are sold out due to demand when using discount coupons.,2022-06-18

1,"The registration process for the app requires obligatory sharing of personal information with potential harmful implications. 3 of the pieces of info required, in particular, would allow anyone with access to the database to steal my email account. Not nice, Lidl. Not nice at all... *Edit* In reply to whoever from Lidle replied to my comment - I would not trust a supermarket to protect my personal data. Especially since you are trying to hoard so much of it without any proportional necessity.",2023-06-30

5,Lidl middle is for shizzle dizzle,2022-05-31
2,Personal offers are almost impossible to locate in the app since the last update. And...the new general Lidl Plus offers don't need to be activated before scanning? Staff says: we know nothing about the app. How does the customer understand this new functionality of the app? Why do developers keep tinkering with UX design? To keep themselves relevant?,2023-10-02
4,Sidste 2 måneder har Lidl plus kuponer været ustabil,2022-05-15
1,Would say good but altered due to the money off coupons keep expiring in 7 days and if you do q big shop once a month you don't need to go back so never get to use them terrible. Should allow at least a month after for expiry.,2022-05-18

5,Great 👍,2022-01-27
4,Very good app the only reason I give it 4 is you can't see how much you've spent on the home screen all the time once you hit £200 spend and there's no more bonuses should be another free bakery item for £210 etc,2022-06-09

4,"Good app, good concept, nice to have a bit of a reward for loyalty, bit of a faff at the till slows me and other customers down, a key fob or card might be quicker. I know its a new app, but constant stream of updates are frustrating. Needs forward planning to use. Often logs me out and needs updates, so opening the app at the checkout and expecting it to work involves more jeopardy than it should. Almost weekly updates are a pain.",2021-11-20

1,EDIT. The new top voucher of 10% off your next shop is such a let down also this means you now have to spend £350 to save £10 Love the monthly vouchers whereas the weekly and scratch card vouchers are a complete waste of time only get vouchers on what you don't want,2022-09-02

At least you can log in and stay logged, so someone has done something.",2022-08-09

3,"New edit: I just saw that lists were added, but you can't sync them with the normal Lidl app. So you still have 2 apps for one store. Even though you advertise the next week during the previous week, you can't activate the coupons until Monday morning... that's bad for those of us making our lists during the weekend...",2024-03-10

3,"Latest coupon version is a backward step for me and many others I would think,as I am sure due to price rises shoppers are going to supermarket little and often to get best bargains,I looked forward to getting my £10 off near the end of the month,now it may only be a couple of pounds as I spend less over more visits,am more likely to look at going back to Aldi now as the reason for swapping initially was for the £15 saving each month.",2022-11-03
5,Love getting a reward for being Lidl customer. Disappointed I missed 2 rewards when I forgot to activate the discount for spending £200 one month and £2 for spending £100 another time. Would like a reminder alert ⚠️ .,2022-07-05

2,The recent changes on the app are very disappointing 😞 especially changes £10 to 10%. Now u have to spend £100 to have £10 off. It's not a great incentive any more. Furthermore it takes long time to achieve the last level (£250) and then it's only 7 days to use it. Not worth all of hassle. Very disappointed,2022-09-30
4,Fair,2023-06-13

2,"Unfortunately there have been at least two occasions in the last 6 months where the Lidls Plus system has been down in the store (a National problem). To get your shopping spend added to the app to enable you to get your reward is not straightforward. There is no in-store customer service, you either need to ring or submit online, but the latter is difficult as you have to send a copy of your receipt as a file under 2mb which I have found impossible.",2022-02-28
1,Waste of space... I downloaded the app it asked for loads of personal information then failed to work.. Would not activate coupon for £5 off first shop nor discounts. Hence I was unable to claim as my next shop will be out of the time zone allowed. UPDATE: Have now used for 2+ years still think it is a waste of space I can't afford to go shopping every 6 days so never get chance to use my reward vouchers as they expire in 7 days. The only advantage is the few pence discount on weekly vouchers.,2022-08-10

1,It doesn't work,2022-08-01
3,"Good thing about the app is that you can create shopping list from the catalog, but what is missing is the date for each article on that shopping list! Now it is all mixed up and you cannot determine if the article is on discount now or will that dicount be somewhere in future. Next thing: if we are using digital app, we do not need paper bill, so please stop printing them and save the nature. Think green!",2022-09-04

3,If you shop in Lidl a lot it's a pretty good app with some reasonable discount vouchers you do have to activate them which I find a little tedious so I tend to not activate them. I also don't shop in Lidl enough to accumulate the spending in store rewards. I would like the app to have more content allowing you to browse everything the store sells especially limited time or seasonal products. It's always great to know what a store has before travelling and enable you to compare prices.,2022-12-29

4,Some good savings but sometimes hard to find out where you access them. Maybe the way forward is for the actor automatically activate any coupons,2022-08-30
1,"Worst app ever never works even after contacting the tech support and repeatedly being told that it is fixed in there system and to follow the steps, reinstall the app delliting als thr data and the information and reinstall the app. I have never had it work there and never had the fix in in the system when I was told that so I had to stop trying bad bad bad and dowt write back won't help my use the aap ever again if tech support does not fix problems that there to be fixed and downt",2022-07-26

1,"This is the second time in one month that the app tells me I have to update while I'm trying to open it at the cashier. Very inconvinient. My mobile net is limited, and I'm holding up the line. The tesco club card app still works if out of date. Lidl app sucks",2024-02-16
4,"Great way of saving money, products are often missing in store, maybe allowing the store to sell an alternative item, would resolve this issue.",2021-10-06
5,Good app with offers..,2022-01-16
2,"I've been using the app since it 1st came out, since the update in January I've not been able to log back in. Takes me back and forth from2 pages, as I can nor longer use the app I've stopped shopping at Lidl",2022-03-10

This turns the create account box blue but when I press create account absolutely nothing happens.",2023-04-25

5,Works well what more can you ask for.,2022-09-11
5,Superb value for money and the Lidl plus card gives you extra savings too,2021-12-22
5,It's a shame the £10 voucher has a limited time use and can expire before a return shopping trip. Could it not be an unlimited time money off voucher. Possibly save them for use at Christmas ?,2021-11-02

3,"There is a bug with scratch cards, since some recent updates, whenever you scratch the coupon , first time it shows the yellow gift image and no coupon even if you've won.secons time you scratch it does add previous won coupon. Hard to explain, but basically it does not work first time you scratch. (3 stars for attention, will change it after fix)",2023-10-03
2,The coupons are never relative to my purchases.,2022-12-31
1,Completely pointless to use anymore after they changed it . You get a item that's worth a few euro after you spend a few hundred euro .,2022-10-12
5,Cheap and affordable,2022-08-21
3,This update won't update I'm also frustrated as one who limits shopping due to Covid and fuel costs that any freebies (scratchcard) disappear Also on a couple of occasions you've been out of stock,2022-04-05
5,Positive,2022-03-12
5,"Total change of heart ....totally a waste of time ....what you get for your points is hardly worth the hassle ...the scratch card coupons do not have any significant prizes, just pennies of the products that no-one wants ....wish these so called supermarkets stopped these stupid loyalty schemes and just lowered their prices like Aldi for instance ....",2022-05-26
4,Flat phone battery means no loyalty points. How about adding receipt scan at next shop?,2022-03-01
1,App crashes on login. Slows down the que with people trying to log in or activate coupons.,2021-10-13
5,Good,2022-02-03

4,Brilliant,2022-10-17
5,Great 👍 Best shop in town,2022-02-25
2,The discounts are always on processed factory foods containing unhealthy ingredients (sugars etc) rather than quality meats and veg....the app itself seems to crash a lot.,2022-07-14

5,One of the best loyalty programs and apps. Did not work properly sometimes but it is getting better and better,2021-10-14
3,Hit and miss,2022-04-11
3,Great when it works but have missed out on credits several times when it says it is updating which takes forever !! When it says update available I cannot access the site so cannot get to the coupons and offers etc.,2021-12-16
4,The app loads swiftly. The discounted items are mostly in line with what I would purchase.,2022-10-28
5,Very good,2024-01-28

4,Would give it give stars but as they have changed the rewards it's not as good as the origanal,2022-10-13
1,I bought today and there is no ticket in the app. The employee said they can not get a ticket as I have it deactivated. I found that the final price was high so I wanted to check it. NOT POSSIBLE now. Service to clients says to waits few days. And reclaim the money lost if there is. Next time I PRINT my ticket again. This is insane I have to wait to see my ticket. If LIDL tried to be environment friendly the app should work. So what if there is no ticket? How to I claim if I change the product?,2022-07-16
5,Very good,2022-05-19
5,Brilliant,2021-11-04
4,OK,2022-07-29
1,"App shows deliberately misleading ads and sales. This is quite tiring. Latest one: ""all prices are the same in all Lidl shops"" and in tiny font ""for basket of 15 products"". All traditional ""50% off!"" actually applying only for second product. That is 25% sale, not 50% sale.",2024-03-10

3,No signal in stores,2022-04-05
5,Easy to use and rewards are good,2021-11-19
2,The app itself maybe ok but the coupons are rarely for anything I need and I rarely buy enough in a month to reach any target so it's a bit of a waste of time bothering with the app.,2021-10-17

5,Good,2023-04-30
5,Works well and easy to use,2021-12-16
4,Could do with staff around the shop to help the disabled and your parking for disabled is atrocious l have to use the parent and child parking as it is closer to the trolleys and entrance from 2 years children walk better than me and babies are pushed in prams they need the wider car spaces but not need the priority parking near the trolleys .they can walk1,2022-12-23
2,The reason I always know what special buys are in Aldi is because of their app. This convoluted app with too many permission and login requests and a pdf scan of a leaflet instead of an actual clickable list is the reason I don't spend much time in Lidl.,2023-02-11
5,Very good!,2022-08-21
3,You keep sending me text about my tokens even when I've activated them.Annoying.,2021-11-18

5,Добри оферти. Благодарности!,2024-01-25
5,Extremely easy to use and understand and you regularly save money. I consider it as a loyalty program when you regularly spend at Lidl and get money off with your shopping.,2021-11-16
2,"Nice idea. Unfortunately the offers are hardly ever on things l would buy. I understand that the spend is linked to a calendar month, but a 30 day period would make more sense. Also 7 days to spend the vouchers is a little tight. Not everyone shops on the same Day every week.",2022-02-25

Love the promise of recipes that you can browse, like and add to shopping list but even though I selected add to shopping list nothing appears in my shopping list.

5,Easy to use and quickly updated,2023-01-22

3,"This Lidl plus is great idea,🤠 however it would be good if we could have a card/key fob of Lidl plus as well, so if internet connection doesn't work in shop, we have it to hand.

1,Edit. App failed twice in store which would have taken me well over the £200 spend. Contacted lidl via the app on both occasions but no response. Was excellent however now it asks you to accept the new t&c's however when you tick the box and click next it takes you to the same page and asks you to accept the t&c's again. A never ending circle! Come on lidl sort it out.,2022-08-02

Went shopping, twice, on Thursday 14th Oct and spent over £50 in total in 2 different Lidl stores and the Lidl Card on my phone (a Samsung Galaxy S10+) would not work at the tills (despite logging on/off repeatedly at the annoyance of other shoppers who were behind me at the till - very frustrating and embarrassing!).

5,Excellent,2022-05-22
1,The app is poor. It is part of a loyalty club that puts the onus on the customer to activate coupons to get special offers. They should be automatically active every week. There should be a tag to go with this app like most other retailers with the QR code on it. How much would that actually cost? Its like jumping through hoops every time you go shopping in Lidl.,2021-12-30

I agree that coupons need to be rolled over, if you've spent the money your reward should stay on without time restrictions.

Poor service and no clear reason why this has to be done?",2022-01-20
4,Very good,2021-12-22
3,"My comments below are still valid but the app has gone down in my opinion, as it is hit and miss if it registers purchases, or a receipt. I don't see why you have to activate coupons, these should just be available if you buy the product shown!",2022-06-15

2,"Disappointing, the app is entirely reliant on a network connection, it should at minimum cache your Lidl plus card. The other week I couldn't claim points for my shop because the store WiFi network was dead and I couldn't get a 4G signal. Not good enough - system design should take care of unreliable networks, wireless networks are intermittent. Ther is also no process to credit points offline - again, not good enough.",2023-02-21

4,"When you ""win"" a coupon, that should stay until you use it up. After all, you let us ""win"" it. I have won a pastries coupon before but when I went to claim them they had all gone. Too many coupons sent out, not enough stock. This is not good customer relations, keep the coupon for the month at least and when stocks are sold out one week, we can redeem coupon in another 3 weeks if need be. Play fair...give the customer a break, especially now with all the rising prices.",2022-04-06
5,Fab love the coupons and rewards,2022-06-19
5,"Bolo by super ak by ste pridali možnosť používať lidl aplikáciu v slovenskom/anglickom jazyku, aj keď je človek v zahraničí. Pretože napríklad ak som v Nemecku a chcem aplikáciu používať, musím ju mat v Nemčine. Inak je všetko super😊",2022-04-10
4,The coupons always worked for me. I live in Austria. I would like to see more coupons for basic products because most of them are for foods I never buy. I get 2-3 gifts every month. The only thing that could be missing is a shopping list feature.,2023-04-26
2,Hi we enjoy shopping at your stores but for 5months now we are unable to use the benefit as the app and phone number won't work.Even your college's in store can't rectify this and there is no way of contacting you direct.We just tried to fill your survey out and the app security came up ad unsafe so your not getting all the feed back you should .CAN you contact me direct by phone.We have tried loading our phone number numerous times and are still waiting for a code 5 months later!!!,2023-05-04

3,"I've been shopping with Lidl for many years and generally my experiences are great however, of late it's been frustrating because Lidl have been promoting foods from around the world and nearly every week when I've made the journey to my local Lidl I've been very disappointed to find that many of the advertised and promoted goods have not been available.

Take a photo of it, reduce it to a credit card size and print it off. Then scan that QR code card at the check out. It is the Lidl server that saved the information of of your spending, not your phone.....",2022-02-09

3,"The app works very well. I never had a problem. You are not required to enter your credit card number, which is very cool. Unfortunately, the advantages are not very good. The monthly rewards are always the same, and I have enough salt and sugar.

Please fix this bug.",2023-11-01

She told me, what no one else had, we should be putting our shopping back into the trolley, and then pack our bags at the shelf along by the windows, to save time at the till. She said this is what people do in Europe, what a perfect system, it makes sense now. I did not know this and, I would say most other customers, do not know it either. Could you publicise this more as it would very beneficial to all. 😃",2022-07-04

1,"Why give out coupons which immediately disappear? The notion that you have a coupon, potentially encourages extra spending, which cannot be redeemed. The 7 day limit is a poor excuse. If I am presented (and save) a voucher, outside a store, I expect it be there at checkout.",2022-02-28

April, black grapes £1.04, now £1.79, unbelievable. I can't buy them now. Would prefer free fruit item up to £1.50 (that's around the most expensive bakery item) as I can't eat too much wheat and I can't have gluten-free stuff due to maize allergy. Please could you swap this for a free fruit or vegetable item? That why 4 stars not 5.",2022-07-22

Folgende Dinge würden mir das Erlebnis sogar noch besser machen: - Coupons filtern - ich würde gerne meine aktivierten Coupons oben stehen haben oder in einer eigenen Rubrik (analog online oder meine Filiale) - Favoriten anpassen - die Elemente unten in der Leiste würde ich anders konfigurieren, da mir z.B. der Einkaufszettel wichtiger ist als Prospekte - Feedback zur App in der App geben, nicht nur für die Filiale nach dem Einkauf",2023-11-20

1,"I agree with others--coupons should automatically be enabled, and the 'scratch card' reward system is pathetic gambling nonsense. The 'rewards' are awful. Spent £50? Get a free bakery item, but don't buy more than one, it'll only be the cheapest one that's free. And don't neglect to use the coupon within five days or no free item for you. Spent £100? Get £2 back. Better use it before it expires, too. Lidl, your rewards scheme is rubbish. Which market is this aimed at? Addicts and junkies?",2022-04-18

1,"Was wonderful but now can't activate any new coupons or even see them - just tells me there's no Internet connection when there clearly is and even the store assistants can't understand what's wrong.

3,Last week we forgot to scan the app and the cashier said it was too late that she's sorry for not asking us had we got the app. This week we had our pick of the discounts and went to scan the app and we were told the reader isn't working today and they are working on it. Really disappointed. Paul Moran.,2021-10-01

2,"Constantly getting logged out of the app, what's the point in trying to use a rewards card if you have to login holding everyone in the queue up just because your app can't save the data?

5,Very good,2022-06-22

3,Interface is terrible. Too much push notifications and adverts when all you want to do is scan the QR code.,2022-09-28
5,Good thanks.,2023-07-28
2,"The whole concept of the app is brilliant but the way this app is made it makes it frustrating to use, for example checking out is a nightmare the self check out tills take forever to recognise the app it would be easier if there was a physical card to scan and the second annoying this is inside the store I don't have any signal to even check the offers or t9 activate the coupons so maybe sort out the signal issue in stores and fix the app as well",2022-02-25
3,Decent enough but recently I've activated coupons or offers on the app and they don't come off the price at till and stay on the app as they are . Really annoying must be a glitch on it.,2024-01-20

5,Good,2022-07-01
2,"No value to users now. It used to have good treats/ offers but now it's tiny discounts on random products. The leaflet section is okay, storing digital receipts might benefit people claiming vat back. But I'm tempted just to uninstall..",2023-03-29

4,"This is a very easy to use app and I do love some of the offers, but unfortunately I get very frustrated with the vouchers. I shop every week a lidl and we're a family of 6 so to spend £200 is very easy but due to being a very busy working mum of 4 can't also shop on the same day and often don't get to redeem my £10 off. You get the month to spent the £200 you should be able to have the month to redeem your £10 off. I'm very thankful that you do give £10 off my shop.",2022-08-03

3,"Beware just used the app for discount but did not work, although it shows the product I bought 1kg tub it was not included it was a smaller 4 pack, come on Lidl this is so misleading. Take care if you are buying for a discount.",2022-08-12

5,Excellent,2022-02-25

3,"I noticed a staff member putting increased prices on a number of items around the store. One was jam doughnuts increased by 10c. Not good marketing doing this when customers are around, particularly at the present time. A suggestion: Cease making it compulsory for customers to activate special offers on LIDL Plus in advance. Revise system to recognize such offers when they move through the till and when customers present LIDL Plus App/phone number, auto reduce total to be paid.",2022-10-22

2,"Used to love the Lidl Plus app, but now that you can only earn ""surprise"" discounts, and not monetary discounts, it has really lost it's purpose. Why have a point system when I don't save any money? Surprise discounts are often very useless items that I do not buy, so basically I have no use for the app anymore. Edit: I am talking about the old system of recieving vouchers, such as ""€5 off"" the total shop. The old voucher system was better than the current ""free"" items.",2022-12-02

5,Excellent!,2021-11-20
2,On multiple occasions I had trouble with logging in and had to change my password. The requirements for the password are insane for a grocery shopping app. What are they going to steal — my coupons? I believe many users give up when logging in is so difficult. Most people won't even remember the password afterwards. Why not add one time login or something similar that would be easy and secure? Other than that the interface of the app is actually quite nice.,2024-01-13
5,"Excellent..Got everything I needed and more! I would say the time limit to use £100 & £200 spend vouchers is too short.. Another thing, If you forget your phone your spend cannot be added to your monthly total spend unless you contact customer services to get it added..Why not?If you have your receipt,cannot it be added at the till?

1,"Poor app experience. Third time I have to uninstall and reinstall it. On one of the biggest shopping months, I discover at the check out that the bar code is unavailable to scan. Apparently this is a common occurrence according to staff. Annoyed me enough to leave half my cart behind and go to MyMarket to shop instead where their savings are just as good, if not better. Check your barcode is working before heading to the check out. Most of the discount coupons are for junk.",2022-12-20

2,"Before, we'd spend £200 to get £12. Now we have to spend £250 to qualify to get 10% off our next shop. So, to get that £10, we have to spend another £100. Total spending at Lidl in the month:£350. It's not right!!",2022-11-10

At Tesco the same 200£ would get you 2£ , and I even got a happy birthday from the app today and a birthday treat donut for free",2022-07-01
1,Nothing special No great savings or benefits Also app a bit flakey. Eg now asking me to update but loops round playstore and app. Sloppy,2022-02-25

5,Is easier than I anticipated!,2021-11-18
5,Fantastic app. I like how you can turn on/off coupons. The receipts come through quickly now which is better. I like the notifications and the offers are very good. I would like it be easier to find items included in the coupons as the descriptions and numbers are difficult to compare to check.,2023-09-09

5,I like to use Lidl app as it gives good rewards.,2022-06-15
4,Like the app generally but find it frustrating that money off coupons must be used within the week. I appreciate that Lidl want customers to return quickly (and spend more money) but it's not always convenient. I've always been positive about Lidl and it is without doubt my favourite supermarket but the time limited on cash off coupons really annoys me and portrays Lidl as trying to manipulating customers shopping timetables.,2022-07-16

3,"It's hard to understand in parts. It also would be better with less retrictions on how the coupons last .eg mine last 7 days ,yet my daughter's last 11 days . I wasn't aware initially that my first coupon already expired , on my 3rd visit to the store . Obviously Lidl expects one to be in their store everyday, thats not realistic for everyone, or empathetic regarding people's circumstances. In short Lidl 's options are too rigid.",2022-03-26

3,Very good customer care. The shop is very clean and tidy. The prices are very expensive specially the basics. Like bread eggs milk cheese ham butter. The fruits are expensive as well. Not everyone can afford to buy or pay for all of those foods. I do like the shop. Very good presentation marketing wise to custumers eyes. I would like to see in the future a basket for food donations for the poor.,2022-07-01

Avocados prices from 60c 10 months ago to 1.29 euros (115% increase). Meat cuts such as rib eye from 5.49 to 6.99 (27% increase), even Tesco's rib eye are less expensive. Most prices have increase way over the inflation limit. Oh and also no more freebies with the app, only discounts!

I am shopping for a family of 8 and usually for the same things but very rarely are the coupons useful to me.

2,"Too many issues with it working over the past couple of months to make it worth using. Can't add purchases on to the card from a receipt when the app doesn't work at the till. The digital scratch cards are a waste of effort and time. All round, pretty poor effort.",2022-02-24

5,Outstanding service,2022-10-29
5,Nic,2021-10-30
3,App is a bit hit and miss some times it works and other times it won't load and the new version of the app means you have to spend £150 more to get the same benefits as old version £10 off when you reach £200 a bit unfair when people need to save money where they can,2022-10-07
5,Great savings at this brilliant store! App works very well!,2022-03-31
3,"It's ok for what it is but is unnecessary. The leaflet and offers app is better in my opinion, better design and ui, and the offers are all in one place, shopping list has its own page etc. This app should be identical but for some reason it's the same thing but different, the only thing this app offers compared to the other one is that ""Lidl Plus discount"" which could have been added to the offers app...",2023-10-16
2,Keine Verwendung für diese App,2023-04-28
4,"Good in general, just not happy about the time scale to use vouchers earned.

1,Extended the reward coupons out from £200 to £250. Great idea in a cost if living crisis......not. Would be good if they aligned coupons to shopping habits like Tesco. Also expiring scratchcards after 7 days. Don't give them out if they can't stay until used.,2023-01-24
3,"Ok app, but like all these supermarket apps, it feels like it's aimed at families rather single people who will buy smaller amounts of shopping. I also don't like the fact that the vouchers once earned expire way to quickly, so I end up losing out on them, which is annoying. Otherwise it's OK.",2021-10-30

5,Lidls app is amazing they give you different options to save money on certain foods and keeps track on how much you send once you've done a shop you get an opinion if a scratch card to win certain prizes and once you've spent £200 in a month you can then redeem a £10 off coupon to use on your next weekly top up shop... birthdays I've just celebrated mine and a happy birthday gift from lidls was a celebratory freshly baked cookie of my choice... digital receipts are an absolute god send!!!,2021-10-21

Contacted customer support and was told they'd give a voucher ""as a gesture of goodwill if I got in touch this month"". They have reneged on offer. Discount vouchers only valid for 5 days, and it is a two step process to open and activate them which is tedious. Will vote with my feet, Lidl has lost my £3-£4k/annum spend.",2022-06-12

1,With this app can't add any shop at Canaries. So it's useless for islands.,2023-06-27

4,Very happy,2021-12-04
1,"Very poor interface at the tills....struggle to get an image on the phone aligned with the reader. Not possible to add a till receipt at a later time if you're unable to use the QR image in store. Rewards have to be activated to be usable rather than automatically being ready for use. Overall, a poorly designed information/rewards app which needs a radical rethink to make it user friendly........(or has it been deliberately designed to be difficult to use to avoid giving out too many rewards?)",2022-02-18
2,The app requires constant updates which are not optional. It's very frustrating.,2022-05-22
5,Good,2022-07-25
5,"It's great for when I remember to use it Edit: remembering to use it now, still good but the app could be powerful when it comes to item availability.",2022-06-02

1,"Spent £100 at competior today & will repeat until you actually listen to your loyal customers & fix! NO REWARD system is better than 'pretending' to offer rewards but not honouring the essence of the incentive by making it very difficult, fiddly, unstable & unpredictable App, & having to COMPULSORILY activate each & every offer! Digital receipts is great, but Annoying, unpredictable hassle that in real terms ""cheats"" yr customers is not big/clever. AUTO APPLY £2 & £10 rewards, use within 30days",2022-03-12
5,👍👍👍 great,2023-05-20

5,The Lidl Plus App is reliable & works smoothly. Cash discounts are a more attractive reward than the loyalty points offered by many loyalty schemes.,2021-11-07
4,Whente app was updated last time I lostmy coupons for the month including the 2pounds and the shopping total towards the 10 pounds coupon also the app disappeared from my phone that is the second time it's happened thenthe lidl application reappeared why was that thank you,2021-10-16
1,"Complete pants. Offers expired coupons?? Tricky to use...even staff are confused. Keeps updating..... Not benefit to me so far, annoyes other in the Q, what is it for?",2022-12-16
3,"I like using the app and the coupons are great however i dont like how once you've finally reached a target of spend, the money off voucher expires within 10 days. No other supermarket does this when you have spent so much money there. I believe they should be valid to spend over a month.",2022-04-04
5,Very good with offers and points,2022-06-27

5,"Amazing app, simple easy no fuss & love that all recipes are digital on there especially when I've got something to return...Excellent app 😀",2022-05-27
2,"Having used this app for a while now I have had 98% useless coupons, and the odd one or two that were for things I eat. You can save a few pence here and there.. but its more or less pointless unless you spend a lot of money on shopping. My worst gripe is the coupons you do get run out in 7 days. Now if I've just done my shopping, how likely am I to be back at the supermarket before that coupon has expired? Could be done so much better just by offering coupons for things I've bought in the past.",2022-10-19

5,Good to use,2023-07-13
4,"Great app,glad you started the reward system. My personal opinion is that you should increase the first level reward to £5. You have to spend £100 to get £2 off which is not of a big deal . Makes no really difference.",2022-03-22
1,"The app seems to always find a way to break when at checkout where I'm getting ready to scan my lidl plus card, if it's not perpetual T&C acceptance, then it's the app logging me out.",2022-02-05
4,"The app was easy to download, easy to use at the till but I agree with other customers that there are alot of irrelevant coupons. I also agree the download should come straight to us, not having to remember to save, then activate, if its for the customer then give it ? Otherwise a good app and money discount vouchers encourages future shopping with you.",2022-11-10
5,"Great, easy to use",2022-01-03

5,Great,2023-04-02
5,Have used this company for some time now and I find the goods to be of excellent quality and price. I have visited stores in many places and find all of the same high standard. There is fresh baked food on offer. Not all products are available which you might find in a superstore. Free parking and toilets.,2022-02-25

3,"Would love to have the option of English language in Sweden! But anyways, I like that it keeps track of the receipts so they don't have to print them. Please English!",2023-04-20
1,I agree with the previous rating/opinion that vouchers should apply automatically. If you get a money off coupon it should be accessible for the month and not just 7 days. I also agree with the person who stated that staff do not do enough to promote the card. On a personal note I think there should be an area for you to query your purchases ie. customer service and not have to get back in the very long queue and wait to be seen Inbetween other disgruntled shoppers waiting to buy their goods.,2022-01-27
5,Great app. Easy to use with good reductions.,2022-05-17
5,Divine.everyone very helpful.thank you to everyones help. Only problem I have is that * I can not walk fast. * I can not push the trolley after shopping in the car park as this make me late leaving the car park. Lets hope I will not get a parking ticket.

3,It's a decent app and sometimes has good offers but it doesn't seem to give you coupons based on previous stuff you buy so I keep getting coupons for meat & dairy products when I'm vegan which isn't great. Also Lidl have no free store WiFi so if you don't have data on your phone you can't use the app in store which isn't good.,2021-10-30
3,"Great App, with loads of special offers, free gifts and money off. Love this app ❤ Except with the new update, everytime I activate a product it brings me back to the start of all the products and I have to scroll through them all again. Too time consuming!

1,Not in favour of this app at all. It discriminates people who are not happy with technical stuff. Why on earth don't you have a plastic card as other supermarkets do. Or a keyring sized tag that we can present. Won't continue with Lidl unless they embrace the customer with no phone or have anxiety about using apps.,2022-02-08
5,Very affordable in this times of high credit crunch,2023-11-24
5,Very pleased thank you,2022-05-28
3,"Good for some things, bad for others. The digital receipts are a great idea, as are the money off vouchers. One thing I don't like though is how the app specifically asks you what your dietary preferences are, but then sends you vouchers for products you can't eat e.g. I'm vegan, put that in the app, but 80% of the vouchers I get are for meat and dairy products. I know I'm not entitled to specific vouchers but what's the point of asking if it's going to be totally ignored?",2022-08-06
1,"If you activate more then one coupon, you will find out that not all of them are used after payment. Also every promotion is kinda useless because the item is already discounted or they don't have it in shop of course...Purely marketing trick to come to shop and spend money.",2023-03-05

Scanning is often hard and updates seem to appear too often if you need to use while out and cant access wifi its very difficult and doesnt work. On the occasions when it has worked its been good.",2022-04-12

1,What use is it in store. ? What use is it other looking at a lot of prices.? What use is it ? Why ask for my email address and then say it's not recognised on the app. Must have been a real genius to design this to confuse the customer.,2022-02-26

4,"Unexpectedly handy! And the software itself seems pretty well made. Kind of annoying that you need phone signal to activate coupons though, given that the stores are enormous Faraday cages and don't offer WiFi to customers. I've kinda got used to the strange QR code reader location at the staffed tills (Covid screens are the main obstacle but the readers could be moved to compensate?), bigger problem run into is that the self service tills often fail to accept the card, despite beeping ""OK""?!",2021-12-08

Since around a month ago the coupons section no longer works and shows no Internet connection. I've seen another recent review of this app from another Sony user.

1,New lidl plus is not worth participating in.. I used to spend £200+ and was very disapointed the £10 voucher was dropped. The old Lidl plus was a much better deal for your customers. With the new Lidl plus I Will stop at £100. I have several £8 off a £40 spend for Waitrose. So the remainder of this months food budget will be spent there.,2022-09-06

5,Use the many lidl shops around me all the time.,2024-03-25
5,"Love it out there , everything is fresh ,staff keep the shop so clean",2021-10-01
1,This updated app will not install on an older phone (such as my Samsung S6) and you cannot continue to use the older version of the app. Therefore if you have an old phone you can no longer benefit from the Lidl Plus offers.,2023-03-23
1,Need of activation even the £2 or £10 coupons which are deserved after spending lots of money there is pretty annoying and not fair I would say. And making them valid for only couple of days is also not very fair as even you spent there lots of money already you just don't always have time to do another shopping again in max. 7days so you loose the saving!! The only real reason for me shopping there is that it's closest to walk shop for me and they've got a good sourdough bread.,2022-04-04

1,The app requires Internet connection even to see the lidl plus card. No reception at checkouts and lidl WiFi also useless. I should be able to scan my card without Internet connection.

Worst of all is it doesn't let you know when your till vouchers are about to expire, why not? - as if we can't guess - but why give a voucher if you do not want us to collect on it?",2022-10-16

Coupons are not worthy the most of the time, and not available on the store!! Discount are just ridiculous if you compare the prices so high lately..Double prices in 1 year, Lidl is not cheap anymore.And the feedback online is another lie and waste of time, as if you say u are not happy with something the outcome is ""error"" & not uploaded.Rude staff too",2023-09-05

4,My experience at lidl is good .,2022-06-12
2,Complicated and cumbersome to use for a few pence discount. Then .......When the money off is applied the receipt becomes a Royal nightmare of small discounts. All-in-all to use this app to the full potential you have to be a dedicated lidl shopper and want to invest in this cumbersome discount app. Activating the app discounts is only a feature designed to complicate shopping- stop people getting money off. Honestly it could be way more simple and less stressful to use.,2022-10-11

5,Very good,2022-11-13
2,"I mean, the app works very well. But I just don't see the point, I guess. Like they don't offer you money off of things in store like clubcard, they give you offers off very useless stuff (this week it's an ice maker) and you have to spend £200 in a week to get any discounts. Which is fine for a big family but when its just the two of us it's very pointless",2023-06-05

5,Ok,2023-10-26
1,Everything I get to the store the app crashes,2022-04-21
2,"App used to be useful, because it gave you coupons to save between 0.25 and 1 Euro on your next purchase. But they stopped doing these. Now all the app does is small discounts on products of their chosing. There is no difference to these products just being on a regular weekly discount - other than that LIDL can track your purchasing habits for market research purposes, if you use the app. They REALLY dialed down any generosity that they used to have when handing out coupons.",2022-03-25

I'm still impressed with what Lidl offer, food always high quality. But please go back to the old way of supporting your loyal customers.",2023-10-24
5,"The app is great. I love having digital magazines instead of paper and ink. The weekly coupons are really useful. Just one problem. I can't access it on my phone at the moment because it is telling me I have to update. When I tap to update, there is nothing to tap to complete it. End of November and still can't update. This is getting more than annoying now. There seems to be no way to do it. Can you get your techies to sort this mess out?",2021-11-30

1,The app is straight forward but when you Scan the app the tills say lidl plus accepted but it fails to register to your Account I know this is happening to alot Of people so would be a networking issue Rather than an individual phone as its Just a 3d barcode that reads your account details...waste of time having it To be honest,2023-05-14

2,&on 8Mar2023 got in store...Have to do another freaking updat SO WE JUST WALKED TO TESCOs ... get sent vouchers for items that don't show up in store (1) can now get wireless conn. Still can't work out where to find a lot of the voucher items. // Can't get wireless access in store so it makes running things difficult. Would also be much more useful for those with Coeliac disease if gluten free products were highlighted. Most vouchers LIDL issues are for 'contaminated' products with allergens.,2023-03-10
2,Your app is very complicated to redeem coupons,2022-05-18

GPS didn't work inside the shop so I was left with a world map. I did not have time to search for my favorite shop and the was no way to skip it. Please make it possible to be always be able to get to the lidl card (even without the internet). I have no time to fuss with picking favorite shop when I am already at the cashier.,2023-03-20

1,"Not worth the trouble. It's already a rush at the checkout without having to scan the code. And though the machine beeps to say the code has been read it doesn't mean it has, it's only later you notice vouchers haven't been redeemed and there's no record of your spend towards the monthly goal for the reward. Best take the paper receipt if there's anything you might need to return.",2021-10-22

2,Not a very good UI. Doesn't integrate with Google Wallet so requires the app to use. Deals aren't that enticing and coupons earned regularly expire before my next weekly shop. Doesn't encourage me to spend at Lidl.,2023-10-15

1,Wouldn't let me use it without updating and update failed at pending. No working WiFi in store.,2022-12-03
1,"4 or 5 times out of 10, the discount Coupons wouldn't apply, the answer I always get is ""some connectivity issue within the store"" and ""we don't know why, it has been happening all the day"" It kind of lures you to buy more knowing you will get discounts and then end up paying more than expected because the coupon decided not to apply, looks like some sort of scam I am deleting the app for good",2023-07-02
1,"Two updates so soon really, more updates not great when in a rush getting your shopping 🙃",2022-07-02

1,The worst app of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2023-08-12
1,"App used to be good, get some free stuff just for buying something. Even though it was just a choc bar or biscuits it was a nice thought and i can see how it incentivised people to actually use the app. Now though its been replaced and you only get 20% off the same things that i would never normally buy and no more free gifts. So i figured i'd leave this review before i delete the app as its useless for me now.",2023-02-10
5,Excellent,2021-12-04
3,It is inconvenient to use at the checkout as it takes too long to bring up the QR code which needs to be the first thing the app displays,2022-06-04
5,Very very good saves all of the receipt of your shopping very easy to use. I'm nearly 80 and I find it good.,2022-05-21
1,"Utterly useless shopping app. No product search facility, which is no surprise given Shidl's inconsistent shoddy stock. Unusable for in-store scanning unless you open it & patiently wait for it to login well before hand. NOT EVEN COMPARABLE TO THE REAL SUPERMARKET'S SHOPPING APPS!",2023-09-28
1,"Do not use this app as the £2 and £10 voucher expires in 7 days, after you spend £200 on the shop you have 7 days to use the vouchers. I prefer Tesco app you have 1 year time to spent the vouchers",2021-12-02

2,"stopped working and asks me to login each time. This is a real pain when you're in the queue and don't have login details on you - who does. So a waste of time. Very poor rewards scheme, not worth bothering with. Have to spend a£100 in a very limited time, then rewards disappear too quickly even if you get any. Not worth the time and effort. Will stop using. Tesco and sainsbury cards are better. Why cant Lidl have a card, much simpler, rewards in post or credited to your account. Come on Lidl, keep us, you're getting left behind",2022-02-20

1,Too many updates in short time. Sometimes this makes me not using the app. It is better the two apps Lidl and Lidl Plus to be one app. It would be easier.,2022-07-19
4,Frustrating 2nd update required in 8 days no wi fi in shop. Card would update with my data. Paid without rewards. Will give Lidl a miss for November and give them another chance in December,2021-11-02

5,It's very happy to see you at the greater,2021-11-05
4,Pleasant except to many trolley cages hanging around and filler trolleys it needs to get some sort of system to remove empty boxes then fill shelves in sections and the sparkling water and others on pallets need a better system perhaps put all the same flavours in a row from back to front so you don't have to claimer under the cardboard after the one you want and then the ones on top fall on you Accident waiting to happen but a good shop thank you,2022-05-20

Just in the last few weeks Orlando 12KG dog food went from 8.99 to 10.99. Their own brand Canyon bars went from 79p to £1.15 and I can buy real Fox's Rocky bars in Home/BM bargains for £1, and Lidls Deluxe crisps went from 95p to £1.19. There is no way Lidl is the cheapest store anymore.",2023-03-18

3,I think the free offers are not my choice they are Lidls controlled choices. Whereas in Dunnes Stores I get quarterly vouchers which is more transparent and offers their customers real personal choices. Lidl could offer their customers better choices to obtain better customer loyalty.,2022-02-01

2,It is not possible to use Lidl card QR code without an internet connection. I missed the free item because of the application's malfunction. There are more and more bugs limiting the usage. Customer service is appalling. They are arguing about non-applied discount due to some internal product ID system. Lidl employees do not react to feedback.,2024-03-28
5,Fantastic app. Makes shopping easier with great coupons and little freebies when you spend over a certain amount.,2024-02-20

4,Bit slow sometimes,2022-08-25
1,Too many updates - whenever I want to use this app there's a new update which I have to download first and which costs me data I don't want to spend basically on an advertising gimmick. On top of this the special offers mostly of items I'm not interested in. Why not cut to the chase and simply let me earn points at each shop that I can later spend on items I choose?,2023-04-26

1,Dislike the new changes. You now have to spend £50 more just to get 10% off meaning you need to spend £150 more to get the usual £10 off. Now (December) spend £150 to get a 45p bar of chocolate. We'll done lidl for helping struggling families..... not,2022-12-01

5,Good,2022-04-04
5,"Brill app, works how it should, however uses lot of memory on your phone, so not good! Do prefer having a plastic card and waving that at the scanner! Nice though weekly coupons as well as money off coupons, better than any tesco or Morrisons card going but they do not last long which is wrong as Lidl wants you to go weekly and encourage you to go out during a pandemic! Prices have gone up at Lidl so no longer go there so will be deleting the app",2022-05-21

Old review: As others mention: the £2 & £10 vouchers that you earn, only last a week. Should be valid at least 2wks, if not a month. Otherwise 5 stars.",2023-01-27

1,"Poor offers in the app. 10% off stuff that's sometimes more expensive elsewhere. 4 cakes for £2 ( nice and healthy) As for Lidl being ""cheap"" could someone tell me what is cheaper. Yes a few things are but some of their ""specials"" (Christmas stuff for example) are expensive. I find I'm not saving money on my weekly shop (and the queues at the tills just dont warrant the miniscule savings) but I do use Lidl for some of the top up items.",2023-10-26

I used to visit Lidl multiple times a week (smaller shopping baskets) so I get the stuff I need despite your stocking issues. I used to shop exclusively at lidl. Now I don't really care about hitting the target, I shop at ALDI if its more convenient. Prices are similar. Your new Lidl Plus is driving me away from shopping at your stores!",2022-10-11

So unload the packed shopping bags and walk away to try shopping again another day while some poor soul at Lidl has to put it all back on the shelves. Plastic cards always work!

1,Since using this app it was good to begin with but of late I've noticed that I have been logged out from it. When trying to log back into the app I'm finding thst I can't straight away as the app wont/doesn't give you that option like previous review its always when in the que in the store. I have lost no end of money off coupons after getting to the £££ qualifying amount. Going to uninstall the app as not worth the hassle of trying logging back in practically every time in going to use it....,2022-02-09

3,"Другото Lidl приложение има много по-добра функционалност на списъка със запаметени продукти (shopping list). Новата формационалност на Lidl+ всъщност не върши никаква работа - изброени няколко продукта. Къде е снимаката, къде е цената? Пише кроасани - какви, от пекарната, опаковани, мулти пак! Как да помня преди няколко дни какво съм била харесала и отбелязала, нали за това е този списък?",2024-02-19
1,"A waste of time. Silly win prizes and silly offers. A bit pointless. Except that you can see the receipts and the montly money you spend at Lidl, I don't really see a good purpose of this app. Aaah and you can check the catalogue online, which is a plus.",2022-07-31

5,I found the app useful. Only problem I have is that when I'm in store doing a shop and wish to check the app to make sure I am buying the product on offer by checking the product code lo and behold I get the broken wires and the app isn't working This happens constantly. I would like to add that I love shopping at lidl. I love the extra space in the car park. I have three dents on my car door through shopping where there is not much space between cars.,2022-04-08

3,"90% of offers are irrelevant to me. For instance, I'm teetotal, yet I'm always given offers for various alcoholic drinks, instead of offers for items I would buy. Sometimes, offers on foods can work out more expensive after you compare various prices on like-for-like foods when in the shop. Also, each time you shop, you'd gain a digital scratchcard on the app. Throughout October 2023, I'd gained 13 digital scratchcards. Not once had I won anything on the digital scratchcard. It's a con!",2023-12-07

1,On 19 July I accessed scratch and said I won lidl gift card. It said that I needed to pay postage so I input bank details at a cost of 2euros ie 1.70.

5,"Great little app to get extra value from Lidl. As if you need it, they must be running close to the margin anyway without discounts. The cashback you get for shops is better than tesco, I can understand why you can't save them for weeks or months.

Improved app gives you a free bakery item on next purchase after £50 spent, £2 of next shop after £100 spent and £10 of your next shop after £200 spent. This is saved over 4 week period before being rest by lidls. So it's a case of use it or lose it as saver money is not carried over.

3,"Not the most useful of ""loyalty cards"" (let's be honest, that's what this is). Coupons would be much better if they were more targeted to the individual based on historical shopping - don't offer me 20% off an item I've never bought. Coupons that are earned are great, but expire far too quickly - if I've just done a big shop and have earned £2 off the next shop, I'm unlikely to need to visit again in a week!

2,"You get a reward stamp if you spend over £10 but no extra for spending extra increments, so when I spent £70 I'd have been better off putting it through the till in 7 separate lots, but that's just not practical. The app discourages you from doing a big shop. Also, when you earn a monetary voucher you only have 7 days to use it which seems unfair, if you've just been shopping to earn the voucher it is unlikely you'll be back in the next 7 days. Maybe Lidl need to rethink their reward scheme.",2022-01-20

5,Great savings. Great value for money. Good quality overall. Good alternative to main brands. I love Lidl.,2021-11-18

2,Screen shot your qr / bar code incase of no Internet This app used to give you good value for money but now they've moved the goal posts. So we're shopping around more and lidl used to get around 70% of our shopping will probably only get around 10%.,2022-09-29

5,Brilliant,2022-06-15

1,"There should be paper card too, scratch cards inside the app are useless as mostly if incase you win are of no interest, the scratch system of 10p or more if you win was very good when they started before official launch so you could spend on whatever you want the weekly coupons should be activated automatically as are mostly useless too & no good incentive for 200 plus shopping bakery discount doesn't activate itself when bakery is empty in evening mostly, worst reward now for 150plus shopping",2023-09-02

2,"I am presently in Finland and your App doesn't allow me to chose languages other than Finnish. This is so inconvenient as I have lost some money buying stuff misunderstanding the offer given on particular items, as this App does not allow to copy the sentences and paste it in Google translate. Also the photos of the products cannot be enlarged. Some really major improvements needed for this App.",2022-08-21
5,I love shopping at Lidl because I can get what I want at a more realistic price.,2022-09-27
5,Most times problem free. I sometimes forget to activate coupons. Maybe it needs simplifying for those who are not tech savvy.,2022-04-04
4,"Some of the coupons are good and the app is generally reliable. It's great to have a record of receipts going back years, so you can see how much you're being ripped off today compared with three years ago. You can't activate two coupons for similar items. They fixed this with bakery goods when they did the bakery wheel spin and ended up with five bakery coupons, but other things like sweets, you can't run two coupons at once. I'm not going back just to get 25% off midget gems!",2023-07-22
1,"It is difficult to navigate, rewards are not carried over, to give something then take it away is counter productive. Either give instant discounts or extend the time limit of the £2 & £10 reward",2022-07-01

They give you a range of choices, eg today I bought my usual kitchen towels, bacon and coffee, but with 15% and 20% off, so no need to fall in the special offer trap and buy things you don't really need. *** I am adding this bit about a year after my 1st review and changed from 5 to 4 stars. The original scratch cards gave you money off coupons, now they have changed to coupons off specific products. I am not one to be taken in by this, and this is a change for the worse.",2021-11-15

As a result I lost the £10 coupon and now cannot use this at all. This smacks of 'Technical Discrimination' - why should I have to upgrade my 'phone to continue using this?

1,"Clear disrespect and division of loyal customer base by forcing this app in order to get discounts. Customers who enter your store should be able to pay the same price with or without application, I for one don't want this literal software garbage and obligation to show it to cashier in order to pay advertised price. I feel scammed. App should be used for other things to attract customers, but never to make difference in price between customers, that's clearly scammy.",2022-08-08

However, unlike Tesco, it doesn't seem to personelise the coupons to your previous shopping. Love the fact that its digital as well.

5,"Worth using if you shop in Lidl as there is usually at least one product you use that can be selected for discount.

3,Disappointed Lidl stopped the £10 voucher on Lidl plus. Its not as good now. Vouchers are ok but nothing I ever buy really. Would be nice if discount vouchers came through for fresh meat products too.,2023-02-08
2,"Чисто функционално, приложението работи доста добре и има сравнително интуитивен дизайн Като стойност за клиента, обаче, е кръгла нула. Изглежда сякаш Lidl го използват, за да прититикат свои непопулярни продукти на клиентите си. Нали уж приложението щеше да прави персонализирани оферти? Нищо такова, единственото, което получавам е оферти за локумени вафли за 2 стотинки. Все по-рядко го ползвам и мисля скоро са го трия, защото до момента не ми е донесло никаква стойност.",2022-09-05
1,"The system Lidl offers is basically laughable - with coupons that you can use on a specific date or in specific time for some products which, no surprise aren't available at the date & time when the coupon can be used. Or the discounts that are almost unusable, for example: you need to spend 25000RSD to get a 10% discount for maximum of 6000RSD spent, which means you get measly 600RSD for your loyalty. The system is something that is not comprehensive, not valuable for consumer, so - UNUSABLE.",2023-06-25

5,Always helpfull staff,2021-12-20
3,"Reward discounts limted to 7 days. As shop once per week not always 7 days apart sometimes 6 or 8 so lose rewards before can use them. Also lately our local lidl does not stock the items on the offer coupons, not just they sold out they don't even have assigned shelf/freezer spaces allotted! So weekly coupons are not always useful even when they are of interest as there is no way to purchase. Surely all branches should stock the weekly coupon offers.",2022-11-11

1,"App is good but this is my only forum to moan about Lidl's 7 day limit on using rewards. It is just mean spirited. Shows Lidl has no customer loyalty. In terms of Lidl products themselves, anything branded Parkside is usually utter rubbish. Do not buy if you are expecting a quality product. Many chicken items have smelt totally off when the plastic seal is opened. Returning products is a right pain because you have to queue on a normal till for ages. No customer services.",2023-04-21

2,"When the app was first launched the rewards were achievable if you were a single shopping household, but now its hardly worth the effort. If I ever spent £250 in one month I certainly wouldn't need to shop again of any significant amount within the next 7 days to gain the benefit of the 10% discount earned. Not sure who dreamt up the new scheme but it's rubbish. Put it back how it was at least the little households could actually benefit.",2022-10-06

Your staff are wonderful, they are busy but always find time to help us seniors. I have two choices of your shops but like the Blackrock (Brighton) one for the extra space and larger small trolleys. Please please expand your Newhaven branch, so much closer and the town is expanding. The sainsburys here need some real competiton, go for it lidls!",2022-12-05

2,"The regular cash desk didn't succeed to read the QR code, support found out just what I reported. Wow. By the time, the gift coupon expired. It takes me a lot of time to find the gift products, and many times they are just sold out. Sometimes the activated coupons are not recognized during shopping.

5,"Always easy to shop but certain items are not on the shelves, but cheerful staff.",2022-06-24
5,In my opinion the lidl app at least gives something back to the shoppers and unlike other supermarket offers you can browse what them offers are prior to going to a store and make an informed choice when at home whether that item is needed by yourself and your family then the benefit is immediate,2023-01-05
1,"Useless. It recently stopped recording my shopping so I lost out on coupons and discounts. I tried reinstalling the app but that didn't fix the problem. I contacted Lidl who suggested that next time I should keep my paper receipt- I opted for digital receipts to be more eco friendly and the app actively promotes this option. I've tried deleting my account, waiting 3 days and reinstalling the app to set up a new account and it won't get past the first page of registration. So I'm off to Asda!",2022-11-10
1,Will not down load,2022-04-29

1,Soooo slow crashing the phone - nightmare,2022-05-21
1,"Discounts do not work. Data collection without any benefit for the customer! EDIT The reply shows that they do not even realize that the point why people install this is to get discounts, so those should work. No data is required to give discounts to customers. Just sell things at the discounts you promise the customers to get through coupons and setting up an account. Of course Lidl does it this way to collect data, to create profiles, to see the highest possible prices that still sell well.",2024-01-11

3,The app has failed to work on several occasions leaving me unable to claim discounts. This seems most prevalent on updates. Lots of the offers seem to be aimed at foodstuffs I don't consume such as ice cream and sweets. Good idea but not always successful for this customer,2021-12-24

5,Always a great shop,2022-04-17
4,"From the customer's point of view, the coupons are largely for non basic items and of little attraction. The main incentive for me is a straight cost saving on spending targets which is achieved by purchasing nearly all my basic requirements in Lidl. An old fashioned plastic loyalty card which achieved the above latter comment would be of hughly more interest to vast numbers of customers(older and non IT literate people in particular)? I'm sure there is still room for this !",2023-01-21

I reached many times the boundary of £200 (let s say in the 24th of the calendar month and I got the £10 reward) but my next spendings of £45(from 27th and 30th of the month) were lost/wiped off, because the counter is reset to zero each month! You need to eliminate the 30 day condition or increase the rewards over £200. Sainsbury Nectar is better.",2022-05-03

Each time I come to use it I discover that I've been logged out and I have to enter my password again, trouble is I'm standing in a queue when this happens and I can't remember my password because it has to be one of those super complicated ones, 10 characters, a special character, a number, etc. On top of that all the special offers are for junk food that I'm never going to buy.",2022-02-05

The only decent voucher was a £10 shopping discount after spending £200 in a month but they made the minimum £250 and, as a single person on low income, this is an infeasible amount.

2,"Keeps logging out, deleted from phone.",2022-06-13
1,This app is really rather bad. It doesn't seem to work more often than it does. When it appears to work you go to till with your shopping & special offers from app to find out from till operator that app is not working. Therefore you don't get the discounts as promised. Had also a couple of freebies in the app which disappeared or where not actually in stock at the store. This app is pointless & more effort than worth it. Disappointing because I love Lidl & do my main grocery shopping there.,2021-10-03
3,Goodbye bugs? Hello improved performance?? An explanation would be nice as to precisely what's updated. This time I WAS in the queue when the app forced me to update but the assistant was able to use my phone number so I could receive my 30% discount on my sticky buns! At least let us choose to update at a later time!,2024-03-18

1,"A Year and a half, after my original review/cooment... The Slovak (Country) app does not support speakers of any other language... It's not really that hard to code an App to support other language users, or Does Lidly actually believe that only speakers of Slovak should be able to use the App in Slovakia. I am certain that this issue is also found in other country (sites). Just because a person lives in Country ""x""does not mean that they speak the language.",2023-08-19

4,Good shop with competitive prices .,2021-12-03
2,I can't use the app. English isn't offered in the country I live in despite the fact that English is very commonly spoken everywhere. English should be a language option in more countries than just Ireland. It would make the app a lot more versatile.,2024-03-03

Compared with other supermarket's app. ++ Every time you take an update, you have to log in again.. ++ You must inform teller what vouchers you wish to use before they scan the product which is almost always too late.

4,"The app is very good when it works, but when there is a problem there is no recourse to solve the problem. If the app does not read in the store there is no way to add or alter the money spent so, conversely you lose any gains for that month. It cannot be beyond the realms of the system to add any monies spent to your account after you have left the store. Speaking to an advisor who says they can't do anything is unacceptable.",2022-03-17

Went into store as I was sent an email stating £5 off a £40 spend. After messing around resetting my password the day before I went into store filled a trolly and went to the till. While waiting in the queue I tried the app. It kept turning itself off and wouldn't open! Left the full trolly told a staff why!",2022-10-22

5,Great 👍,2024-02-11
3,"The app in itself works fine. Easy to find all the functional bits. The problem is that I don't feel the reward makes it worth scanning.

And even picking up a number of magazines on the way out to give some to mates so they can see why they should be shopping in Lidls. Those that have the que sometimes put them off has only ever reminded me of Jim Carrey from Dumb N Dumber.

2,"We love Lidl, but find the phone app difficult to use. We usually meet both voucher marks, but it is difficult to balance paying, bagging, managing children AND getting a mobile signal for using our Lidl Plus card. Very stressful during busy shopping times... and the voucher validity dates are confusing so we often miss using them before they expire.",2022-02-25

5,Werkt prima,2024-03-02
4,"I don't think Lidl knows me well enough to target me with offers. I often forget to take my phone. Most of the offers I get are not really what I would mormally buy, so I don't even activate the token. I will try to remember to take my phone and hope that Lidl can target better. To be honest, Lidl would never be my go-to shop. I cannot buy all that I need at Lidl, and therefore really only call in for milk, bread and alcohol or occasionaly vegetables because it is within 500 yards of me.",2022-04-26

4,Hard to benefit from rewards needs to be normal food,2022-01-27

1,"Oversold app with plenty of tracking and data sharing benefits the supermarket more than the shopper. Vouchers have an unnecessarily & overly restrictive 7 day limit (in my case mostly worthless), pretty poor considering the value Lidl obtains from data collection. Just look at those permissions the app wants!!",2021-11-24

1,"You cant select the language of the app. The app is translated in many languages but you cannot have as location ""ITALY"" and ""LANGUAGE"" english. I wasnt able to find this option which, if true, is extremely shortsighted. I hope i am wrong though , and i'd happily change my review once i discover how. I am using it in czech republic but I do not speak czech. Edit: Obviously i do not expect Czech products to be translated, I would like the app and all the menus to be in English though. Thanks",2023-05-08
4,"My local store is brilliant and clean. The coupons are a great idea but as I can't always go shopping on the same day as the previous week I miss out on the coupons especially if I have acquired them through the amount I spend.

4,Absolutely fab - blood better then most food apps out there! And I feel like I child getting the scratch cards haha. I will however add that the coupons are very random.

When i come to cashier it takes ages to use things from app i need. What you need to do is put BIG login button on FIRST app page. NOT sign out out your own.

Not even J.D. Gross?) whereas previously it could be used to buy a month's supply (or more) of any cleaning product. Long gone are the days of ""£10 off voucher when you spend £200 this month"".

4,"Good - you could improve the app by having an option to build a shopping list based on your previous purchases.

And the £2 and £10 coupons expire too quickly - some weeks I shop on Friday and some weeks on Saturday so it's easy to miss using them.

When it was working it was annoying that it needs to be online to work, and that coupons don't last long, and that there is no way of adding purchases if the app/scanners aren't working, and there are too regular updates which means I have to check to update before shopping, and the updates have not managed to upload on my phone..",2022-05-23

3,"A bit clunky, always seems to need upgrading in store which takes too much time so often I don't bother to use so as not to upset other shoppers waiting for the app to upload.",2022-12-28
1,"It's basically a spam. You do get some discounts, but usually for stuff that no one wants to buy. If you spend 25k rsd, you supposedly get 10% coupon, which is limited to 6k rsd, which is 600 rsd discount, and that's funny money, so you basically just help them keep track of your spendings. Deleted.",2023-02-28
2,Annoying is the right word. Coupons don't activate automatically. Why? It's like they want you to forget to use them and it's the most annoying thing of this app. Plus there isn't any incentive to do a bigger shop. If I spend £200 i get the same (useless) scratch card as if I spent £1. It's not convenient to split the shop in 3 or more purchases because it's annoying. I should get more stamps or scratch cards for a bigger shop.,2022-02-03

5,App is very clear and easy to use,2022-06-19

1,horrible to use and tries to tie me to one single store or I have to go back and redo all the settings. I regularly use about 20 different lidl stores. also why can't you change the language independent of the country you are in as everybody else is complaining about? it would be much better just to have a fixed discount percentage on a plastic card like other shops. Great shop shame about the app,2023-08-27

Z minusów to wkurza mnie długa animacja na przyznane kupony której nie da się ominąć, w nosie mam ten prezent i jak kupon z niego wyskakuje, większy czas na użycie apki zmniejsza jej funkcjonalność. A druga sprawa fajnie by było moc dodać kartę dużej rodziny do aplikacji i nie musieć jej skanować za każdym razem ale żeby aplikacja ogarnęła to automatycznie wraz ze skanowaniem karty Lidla- duże ułatwienie.",2023-11-04

And the same email that you have this upgrade to ????) In one way I am silly still shopping at your welling branch as I have lost quite a bit of money over the several months I have not been able to get your discounts based on how much I spend each month,2022-08-06

1,"Sainsbury's Nectar app is better in every single respect now. It gives me money off products that I actually want, instead of random ones chosen by Lidl. Also hate the way you have to go throught the rigmarole of activating coupons, and the very short expiry dates on coupons you earn (why is this necessary?) Also, the reward for spending £150 is...a 55p chocolate bar. THANKS LIDL",2023-05-04

От друга страна, не ми се занимава да влизам често в приложението. Прекалено много приложения стават и време се губи",2023-02-11

2,This App is NOT for the Elderly. Firstly I have a PAYG Mobile so if I don't log into App before leaving home I miss out on Vouchers/Coupons and logging my spend. NO WIFI Secondly as OAPs we only shop at Lidl but don't shop every week so we lose out on claiming because we don't spend as much money in a month. Coupons are for Children's food or spicy food OAPs don't eat,2022-02-24

5,Very good idea. Finally like Tesco they have a benefit scheme. Very good. There are many savings and coupons to use. Much better in app form. Were all on our phones anyway and always carry them with us shopping. Love the online features and the online digital receipts. You can see the Lidl magazines on here too. See whats new and enjoy. Worth using as Lidl is already great on value and superb prices. Great idea. Recommend getting this App. 5*,2022-02-24
5,Very good.,2021-10-27
1,"I have gone all through my phone. ALL permissions for apps are turned off. No app should be able to control my phone. EXCEPT LIDL PLUS DOES It turns my brightness to maximum, and that on this phone is very torch like bright. Me and my phone cannot override it. This is not right on so many levels. Your scanners shouldn't be so defective that they need such a bright display, how can they read a printed coupon eh? And your app shouldn't take control. Full stop. No control. Deleted and phone reset",2022-10-01

5,A good app considering it is still relatively young in its development. My main observation at this stage is that it is often not accessable once inside local store.... However that could be due to poor connectivity in the area rather than functionalitybof app itself.,2022-11-05

2,I wish this app was as fast as their checkout staff.....! It takes a half a band of shopping to pass before the app loads. Not to forget to accept the updates and or loggin from the last change.

1,"Trying to decide whether to keep shopping in Lidl. It's basic items are well priced. But the app is really annoying. Sometimes it doesn't work at all, sometimes it doesn't scan. You end up waiting for ages for a staff member to come and sort it out. For me it makes it complicated. You have to scan everything then get your phone out and go through all the rigmarole then get your card out to pay, talk about making life complicated 🤨. The coupons are useless never really anything I would buy.",2022-02-24

2,"Childish Application! Sometimes it works, sometimes not, also the wifi in many Lidls is poor or suspended for long time, without any adjustments from the location managers... Application is childish, spinning wheels, lottery tickets you need to shave, activate this, deactivate that, pass the cashier and observe that the activated items were not redeemed... like for kids, or made on purpose, to cheat on customers- frustrating. 😤 For sure, it's possible to improve - is there a will?!",2024-01-05

1,I often traveling. As a result instead having one app and ability to read offers in understandable language (English) i must change language on god know what in each country. Do in order to use one app i must learn 10+ languages more or i must spam each and every device of mine in order to get app work in your shops all over the world?! Do you are multinational company or not?!?!?! Can not simple put english language as a option in every country?!,2023-09-13

3,1.In some of your shop there is no signal. 2. I have realized at the till that I have to update Lidl app. I didn't want to hold the line of other customers so I couldn't scan it. It needs skip update option.,2021-11-03

5,Excellent,2022-10-07
2,Not too bad for Dinosaurs,2022-03-11
3,OK who broke the app? After the last update it forces you to accept new T&C and privacy policy. That's fine but the app doesn't accept this and is stuck in a loop. What's the point putting an email address on Google Play for feedback that you don't monitor???,2022-02-05

1,Prieš tai naudodavau ir viskas tvarkoje buvo. Bet paskutinį kartą noriu mokėti ir kažkodėl reikia pasirinkti savo parduotuvę iš nauko kitaip jokios aplikacijos funkcijos negalima naudoti. Jei ne pasirenki parduotuvės aplikacija bevertė ir dar kai tai nutinka prie kasos kur prekės skraido. O ką tas privalomas parduotuvės pasirinkimas duoda vartotojui? O gi beveik visiškai nieko! Tai kokio velnio jis privalomas? Pasirinkus nebegalima pirkti kitose parduotuvėse?,2023-03-21
1,It is so frustrating and I get to 100 spend and then it goes back to 0 nothing is gained by having to open my phone click on the app.,2022-04-04

1,Constant updates! 🤦‍♂️ In regards to the lidl reply.. I have never been logged out. I just seem to be hit with app updates constantly on a weekly basis??

Thank you and keep it up, you have no complaints from me. The staff in the Skelmersdale store are friendly and polite and so helpful and go above and beyond to help anyone. Lidl has now become a store that I visit often. Whilst all the other supermarkets are hiking the prices up considerably, Lidl is not and this is nice to see under the circumstances.",2022-08-05

4,Good,2022-06-15
2,One of the most useless apps I have ever come across. Savings are always on stuffs that I never buy. Perhaps this is done intentionally to ensure that savings are never used by shoppers. The app also constantly freezes when I want to use it.,2022-09-14

4,Very useful items and what bargains they have pleased with my app,2023-11-28
4,The app is fine but the rewards are very naff. Effectively about a 1% discount and coupons on a few slow moving lines of obscure goods. No personalisation. A token attempt not a loyalty program,2022-07-01
5,Works well to get some offers and money off products.,2022-09-22

5,It is easy to set up couple of min's away you go,2023-12-01
4,"It is a very handy app for shopping. The only problem I've ever experienced while using the app is, when you get into a Lidl supermarket and lose internet access. Then it is not possible to scan the QR code in the app, and you lose all the discounts in the app. This is not a problem with the app per se, but Lidl should really think of providing free WiFi access in their supermarkets. Others do it, why can't they?",2021-12-29

5,Great staff easy shopping,2022-08-20
4,"Good app which provides interesting perks. I think that there should be bigger discounts offered when you reach the milestones. If the wheel which decides what prizes you get is brought back, it should give you higher discounts as well and also give you more chance of winning.",2022-06-11

4,Can you please insert English language as an option for lidl plus in the Czech Republic?,2022-07-30
4,I love lidl and shopped here long before the introduction of lidl plus. I find it a little annoying that having spent a great deal of money and getting a coupon for £2 or £10 you have very little time before it expires. Why bother. If I've just done a shop for £120 I'm not likely to be back in the next 5/7 days to spend another £40 therefore the voucher is worthless and receiving it and losing it has vexed me at least twice,2021-10-25

2,I'd like to make a few suggestions: 1. Activated coupons to automatically move up first so that the user can immediately see them and remember the products they activated without needing to scroll down. 2. Add a 'Feedback' section in the app. 3. Shopping list is not comparable to the 'Lidl' app that unfortunately is not used anymore. The current shopping list in 'Lidl plus' is not useful.,2024-03-18

1,"At first this app was good, you did your weekly shop with good offers and got a useful money off voucher in the scratch card. Now the money off vouchers have stopped, the weekly offers are no use, and the scratch card gives you a voucher for something you probably don't want and which usually is out of stock. Not impressed anymore. Update- Getting worse! The free voucher item is never in stock unless its chocolate or sweets, nothing healthy unless its marrowfat peas!",2022-10-23

2,"It's OK, it used to be better with the bonus wheel, it always felt like there was a chance of winning something good. Now it has been updated with a pointless scratchcard type bonus game. Where you hardly ever win anything so you just sigh, swipe once just to reveal enough of the wording which reads 'sorry you've not won anything this time' and quickly exit. If you are lucky to win anything now, it'll be something like 10p off vegetable oil. Wow! Or free muesli for spending over £100 🤦🏻‍♂️",2023-10-20

4,The app is great however I think instead of a free item from the bakery when you spend £50 in a month you should get a £2 off voucher and when you spend £100 you should get a £5 off voucher instead of £2 but overall it's a good app with a % of certain items each week plus you get a scratch card within the app after every time you shop which at times if your lucky gives you money off or a persentage off certain items and which how everything is going up in price any bit of saving is a bonus,2022-08-15

I now buy a few basic cheap items from Lidl, but do my main weekly shop with Tesco, Asda or Sainsburys. Maybe 'you'll think again?",2023-01-19

Prima data am crezut că am omis sa scanez codul QR la self scan, dar și a doua oară fix după 10 minute, nu mi-a luat un considerare ce am cumpărat.

1,"Very flakey, would be fine if it was reliable December 21, it doesn't work at all. Reinstall? Have to do this every few weeks. A royal PITA. May 26: once again, without an email notification WHICH THEY'VE GOT, updated LIDL plus ceases to work once you're in the store, because that's when you open it. Lose all discounts/coupons etc. A nuisance",2022-05-26

Am dezinstalat si reinstalat aplicația și tot nu funcționează cuponul. Ce e de făcut mai departe?

4,"The app is really easy to use. On the odd occasion, activated coupons haven't worked so we've had to get in touch online. It always gets sorted quickly though. A lot of the coupons aren't really relevant to us so it would be good if you had an option to mark specific coupons as irrelevant, so you don't get offered them again. Other than that, I would highly recommend getting the app and a lidl plus account.",2023-02-02

1,"Big on Quality - Appalling on Chicken Welfare. Absolutely sickened and disgusted to see the undercover stories of non existent chicken welfare across the Lidl supply chain continue to surface. Your Christmas marketing campaign focused on cute n cuddly ""Lidl Bear"" instead of the less appealing footage of the terrible lives that the Frankenchickens that you continue to sell & brought a significant increase in market share. Use this to do the right thing and sign the Better Chicken Commitment",2023-01-09

1,Not available in NI,2023-12-27
2,Used to be good. Too gimmicky now. If shops are going to use reward apps keep it simple. Too confusing now. Going back to mixture of lidl and aldi rather than deal with getting all the way to beyond £250 in shopping each month. Not enough range to hit £250 easily.,2022-09-27

4,App improved however disappointed about changes to Loyalty scheme. Specifically 10% discount off next shop once £230 mthly shop reached. This replaces £10 discount off nxt shop' once £200 spent. Particularly disappointing is offer only valid for 7 days... Less incentive to shop to achieve Lidl offer targets more-so as other Supermarkets have competetive price matching.,2022-09-22

1,Useless app. The rewards/coupons are very poor and will expire before your next shop. Just literally received one for 30p off a packet of root vegetable crisps. Long story short you won't save a lot of money with this app. Stand by for automated response from lidl.,2022-11-19

1,"Bit of a con. Scratched a treat of £1 off, went to till and it didn't apply, went into treats and it wasn't showing up any more. A lot of work with Lidl's card: you need to activate each and every product on offer otherwise it doesn't apply even though you are using the very same app to scan at checkout. Why Lidl the extra work? People complain about this issue in comments since years ago and all you do is reply and say feedback is important. Yeah right ... You ""note"" but you never take action",2024-01-29

1,"Not worth using it anymore!! There was a time when Lidl used to give you back money on your shopping, but not anymore. All they seem to give is discounts on stuff that you have absolutely interest in buying! I also found out yesterday that they no longer issue ""Scratch tokens"" anymore when you use the app in store. Because of that, I prefer to go to Tesco now. At least there you earn points / money for future discount vouchers!! And they have self checkouts also. Nicer shopping experience there!",2023-10-24
5,Great Service Thank You,2023-01-29

Nach research im Netz lernte ich, dass dies bei manchen Banken ""halt nicht klappt""). Aber zum Glück, weil ich herausgefunden habe, dass man dem Partner Tink Einblick ins Konto gewähren soll?!? Die Alternative mit der 1cent Überweisung ging auch nicht, weil die Code-Nummer nicht funktioniert. Warum akzeptieren die nicht einfach Kreditkarten oder Google Pay?",2023-10-05

5,"Nice place for grocery. Need to bring more Indian products like pillsbury wheat flour, TRS gram flour, surya basmati rice and many Indian vegetables which we have to go to Glasgow cash and carry. Hope you can bring in East Kilbride lidl. Looking forward. Coupons should be given according to the previous purchases rather than sending useless coupons which can't be used.",2022-11-07

2,Hard to see the products on my phone then hard to find them on the shelf. Quite a few times having searched a staff member has told me they are out of stock. Much prefer to shop where these silly gimmicks aren't used. I probably go to Lidl less scene this was introduced. Love your support of the Lgfa. Keep up the good support on that front and go back to giving a fair price for a product without all the hassle. Kevin.,2022-04-04

1,To make an app for EU shop and make no opportunity to change the language of interface different from the language of country - is absolutely senseless idea. I'm international student living in Lithuania and when I set my country to Lithuania I can't change language from Lithuanian. Just why? It makes no sense,2021-10-25

1,"Aplicação pouco prática e com poucas vantagem. As promoções são muito específicas e obrigam os clientes a andar com o telemóvel na mão. Os funcionários do LIDL na caixa querem despachar o mais rápido possível os clientes e não parecem demonstrar qualquer interesse pela aplicação. As promoções deveriam ser como as que os concorrentes fazem 5, 10, 15% de desconto imediato sobre o valor total, e para validar só necessário dar o número de telemóvel associado à aplicação LIDL. Assim era fácil.",2021-10-08

Three stars tho as it happened more than once that we scanned our card in the shop, and it didn't register the shopping. Missing out on the jubilee £10k competition due to that and won't probably reach £10 off this month. Annoying as you can't add your shopping manually when it happens.",2022-06-04

3,Fairly easy to use Coupons not exactly earth shattering! Reduced to 3* because the £2 and £10 savings coupons have to be used within week so if you take a holiday or break you lose the saving. Coupons limited use so sensible. Perhaps extend the two cash ones to two weeks or three?,2022-04-13

4,"Easy to use, and rewards are a plus compared with Aldi, but big problem is that the app doesn't store the lidl plus card QR code locally on the phone.

3,"The app is useful for collecting your digital recipes and keeping track of your expenses, but as a student, I don't like the way it's trying to get me to spend more and it's not exactly an ethical practice either. This app is not designed for mutual benefit but to get customers to spend more. There are small bonuses for ridiculous ""spending targets"" that expire within a week and must be activated. Other discounts seem to just attract people to more expensive products, the only useful discount",2023-04-02

2,Yet another update. That's 2 in less than a month. Last one deactivated all the coupons without me realising so lost out on quite a bit of saving (CS issued a money off coupon in response though). Haven't checked what this one has done yet. Why so many updates? Turned auto update off because of last time but then not being able to scan the lidl card until after updating when waiting at the checkout is not good. Again went through without using the card...awful app really,2023-10-31

1,"Prijavljuje grešku svaki put kad hoću da otvorim Lidl karticu - znači, ne mogu da je koristim, kao i svaki put kad pokušam da dodam kupon - isto, ništa ni od kupona. Sem informacija o aktuelnom letku koju možete pronaći i na običnoj Lidl aplikaciji, Lidl plus app je potpuno beskorisna.",2022-07-25
2,"It isn't useful, the only worthwhile function is having your bills stored with your account. Coupons are random and mostly worthless. You have to activate them before you pay, which is ridiculous. Developers may have the idea people use this every day at home - no way. Today I tried to have my code scanned, but it was updated, so I had to accept stuff, then I had to choose my favourite store and since I couldn't skip the step, I gave up. I'm thinking about deleting this trash.",2023-04-19

3,"You never/rarely win much on the scratch cards and when you do, half the time it's expired before you get chance to use it. If you make a purchase at Wetherspoons, say, it'll give you the best price... Not Lidl. They never apply a discount in the way that's cheapest for you. I found this out when I got a free bakery item but to get what I wanted I'd have to put two separate transactions thorough so it didn't just give me a free 19p bread roll. Not great. Better than a kick in the teeth though.",2022-12-14

4,"Difficult to find and make sure offers are active. Missed out on two big purchases today because the offers weren't there until after my shop. Thought I had activated others, but obviously not.

1,Not a great app really. The coupons don't last long. Not very many perks. It's not really worth having. I shop more or less monthly so always spend over £200 and the coupons have always expired when I want them. Shame really as I do 90% of my shopping at Lidl.,2022-03-10

4,Like to see offers and save on shopping,2022-08-29
2,I have this app and I have spend loads of money in this store but I don't really see the benefits of the lidl plus card I have . I have tried to have small talk with the till operators about how I can get anything from this card and they just either look at me like i am crazy or laugh. THe way it works of pressuring customers to buy items the store have on offer in order to save is not good to poor people like us,2022-11-29
5,Easy to use,2022-07-23
1,"The app does not do service to the otherwise amazing design that Lidl often delivers via their store fronts or in particular their ""weekly offer books"". The app does not give you the option to select an often visited store as your primary store, it does not offer you an idea of stock in said store and their prices or offers. It has a link to a pdf version of their offer books which is pretty poor. The only real positive is the digital receipts kept and even that is a hasstle.",2022-07-14

4,"Great when working, stops too often in store and you loose the benefits.. Liddle expects you to rectify by phoning them which I do not agree with as not a customer caused issue",2022-05-18
1,Downloaded but have never been able to use this at the store. When I scan its states error and the store day uninstall it and the reinstall. Did this twice still the same. Not the best app. So yes I am missing out on the great coupons,2022-07-16

Another point I would like to make there were only 6 boxesof rifled tissues on the shelf . I offered to buy the because I needed some but the shift manager said he could not do that. What a waste.,2022-07-12

5,Very helpful lady at the till she said I had coupons to use saved £5,2022-12-23
1,"Everytime app updates you need to re enter the password. Now here's the problem with that. For some unknown reason Lidl want to fortify your account with a unbreakable password. It required 10 characters, one upper, one lower, one number and a special character. Needless to say I can't remember what password I've set and of course you can't save the password either so I have to reset password each time. Why not just keep things simple? This is worse than my banking app!",2022-07-18

As a result, it does not accurately display the target reached, and the £2 or £10 coupons don't get added on the same day, so you only get 3 or 4 days to use the coupon. If I call Lidl customer service, they say to wait for 48 hours.",2022-05-27

As currently, all I get from scanning my shopping in to the app, is 30p-£1.00 off a specific item, which I normally would not buy. Please please please start a loyalty scheme! E.g if I spend £50 I get points to spend in store. Then that is an app worth downloading!",2022-02-16

Zaidimo metu inventorizacija pasirinktos parduotuves tikrinima ar ne? Kadangi gautas prekes tikrai su kaupikliai skenuojat ir visas info laikomas kazkuriouse serveriouse.,2022-06-27
1,Offers never relate to anything we've bought or would buy. In store bakery offer after 7pm is useless as fresh baked goods are sold out before late afternoon. App now keeps saying update even though I have the latest version.,2022-02-25

1,Was a good but after changing I will stop going to Lidl makes shopping now to get the £10 needed spend £350 and 7 day's to used it's to short for me no worth it anymore going to lidl also coupon offers was nog good enough staff what I never buying.,2022-09-08

4,👍,2023-10-18
4,Good quick service at the tills. Friendly staff. Quite a few gaps on the shelves but I'm not sure if this is down to supply chain issues or staff shortages (they do have vacancies). Shelf life not great on some products.,2022-06-11
4,Quite good needs a a search element.,2023-06-18
4,Loving the vouchers and money off coupons but I have had quite a few times where the app just wont work which can be frustrating if you have a £10 off voucher!,2022-01-25
5,Really good,2021-11-10
1,The scratch and win had errors and my coupon did not load. Can't claim back lost coupons due to app error. Not a good App. At least Tesco retains your coupons for a longer period than just a week.,2022-02-12
5,Brilliant,2022-05-10
2,I downloaded this app and went through the steps until it came to ADD YOUR STORE. I tried to add my store and I wouldn't let me. *Update... I spoke to a lovely young lady in my local store (Ballyclare) who sorted this out. It seems lidl app does not recognise Northern Ireland stores. She had to select another store in GB (as these were the only ones recognised) then change in app after. She sorted it in 2 mins. Maybe sort this out or have directions how to get to home store online.,2024-02-12
4,Kind and helpful staff. The customer service keeps getting better and better.,2022-08-09
5,"Love Lidl, love the app!",2021-12-12
5,UX on point. I absolutely adore this app the way you can view your receipt in the exact format like the paper one. I love that when you have discounts on a particular section of the store you can view the list of products. I love the little tracker that gives you gifts and discounts when you spend money in the shop. We all need to buy food so Lidl being very affordable with a decent range of stuff and rewarding you with a bakery bit or a doughnut on your birthday is a chefs kiss. WELL DONE LIDL,2022-11-10
2,"It is OK, discounts could be better",2024-01-21
5,👌 best,2022-02-12
5,"You get money for spending money, it's a win win situation",2022-03-13
5,Great,2022-01-23
5,If you do the majority of your grocery shop in lidl you'll easily hit the £200 a month mark. I'd you get it every month this app will give you £144 over the year just in money off coupons)(and that buys a lot in lidl!) on top of that it offers money off specific products and competitions for cash or more coupons. There's really no reason you shouldn't get this app.,2022-02-27
5,Keeps you bang up to date with offers and bargains,2022-11-21
5,Super Toll,2022-06-21
4,"Easy to use, informative, clear website. However, the reward coupons have a 7 day limit AND need to be activated - double whammy for the customer! Otherwise, value for money shopping!",2022-04-04

2,"Uporno mi cele nedelje za svaku kupovinu saljete istu grebalicu za creme instant kafu u staklenoj tegli.

3,"Still no free WiFi in Lidl stores so you have to use mobile data. Also a few times now offers have not worked so despite selecting 15% off Snackrite crisps offer it hasn't shown up at the till.

1,"I have missed many points as the signal is so poor at the local Lidl. Now I can,t even get into my account because it states I need to update my app. It is logged as updated on 10.08 22 but I still can,t move past yhe update you app. There is no other way to update, it only takes you to having the app on another device, like I,m going to take my tablet to the supermarket!

1,"It's absolutely ridiculous that you keep disabling the whole app with new updates. This means that I regularly approach the checkout and when I want to scan my Lidl Plus QR code, it simply doesn't allow me to display it. The people who made this decision should be sacked on the spot. Ridiculous.",2023-04-30
1,"There is no English language option for Germany. It shouldn't be difficult to add English. Also, discount coupons are not counted automatically. Every time, activating each and every one is not practical.",2023-07-04

4,"The app feels a bit disorganized and crowded. The home page is cluttered with all sorts of stuff like a website, sliding menus to ""partners"" and the online shop, adverts for the shop (no need to double up, you already offer a special tab for specials). Doubled up information nobody needs. The specials page feels like just a copy of the web one, not a dedicated app solution. The coupons section is endless scrolling (although i appreciate the coupons, but if not for them i wouldn't use the app).",2022-12-31

1,"*note to Vicky* Thanks for explaining how selecting your country works, I know this might sound strange, but I was actually able to do that all by myself. If you don't have an actual solution, don't bother replying. Patronising information such as you have provided is a waste of everyone's time. I've already done that for the UK and Ireland. *Won't let me select my local store, search for it and it doesn't appear on the list for either Northern Ireland or Ireland.

Their stores are always so clean and car parking (particularly Station Road) is roomy and available to everyone. All in all..definitely my shop to go to !!",2022-08-04
1,"Time to uninstall. Having to log back in after almost every update means you're holding up the entire queue. Of course this means lose the discount codes - but other shops discount for everyone, not just people with the app so it's time to shop elsewhere. But just my views, I've asked multiple people.

1,I used to think the app was brilliant. However since the change in reward system I've changed my mind and will be deleting it as soon as I earn my last £2 off coupon. Real shame....I was never interested in any of the items that the money off coupons were for so the money off coupons were the only incentive.,2022-09-09

2,In store I can never get the coupons up. I have to write down on a shopping list before I leave home. Also the 7 days to use the £2 and £10. Is too short. I missed many during lockdown. I live 11 milles + away from all my lidls. Also I m a pensioner so I don't always shop on the same day of the week or every week. . 10 to 14 days would be better.

Today, however, I couldn't make the card appear because the app decided it needed updating but in my Lidl there's no mobile reception. I had to miss out on the discount because there was a big queue and no time to go outside, download the update, etc. This has happened so many times by now that I've decided to uninstall it.",2022-04-06

Seems to have been resolved,so added a star 2 - only gives you up to 7 days to use a voucher, so if you shop less than weekly, not great. 3 - got to a purchase target to get money off next shop, activated voucher, no money taken off shop.

2,Not easy to use just like self service tills and scanning of reduced items at Lidl. Another frustrating technology from Lidl. Just bought nearly £30 worth items and Lidl app is only showing £22.50. How's that worked out? It's time consuming to log on to the mobile to use the app when there's a long queue. All I have benefited so far is 50p off salad. Always the same money off offer.,2022-05-08

3,"The app works well. There are 2 ""issues"" I have with it. 1. Vouchers earned from shopping or won via the scratch card/wheel spin expire too quickly. If you shop once a week you have to make sure you get to the tills earlier than the week before otherwise the voucher expires. These vouchers should have a month expiry not 7 days. 2. The weekly vouchers are not tailored to the items you buy. They are mainly items I never, and will never purchase. It would be much more useful if they were tailored.",2023-06-22

4,"It's good to use and very good coupon deals, scratchcards are good. The only issue I have with the coupons is I rarely ever get coupons for healthy foods. The only coupons I mostly see are for bakery, which is mostly sugary or loaded calories, bread, alcahol, chocolate, ice cream, sweets, etc. The only healthy option I rarely get is sometimes the juice or a yougart. I just would love some more healthier options so I can actually use the coupons I earned. Thanks. I hope this helps.",2023-08-29

4,"Simple app. Lots of great offers every week. Savings when you reach spend thresholds. The magazine is on the app and avoids paper waste and you can see how far you have to go to get rewards. What's not to like? Should allow your receipt to be added when you forget to present the virtual card. Lost a lot of savings that way. Now, I no longer worry about holding up the queue.

1,Why do i have to keep updating your app? Get it right 1st time and wasting folks time. Its bad enough you cant get till service when you need it. Then have que ages for self serve. Then half dont work.then some are card only when only have cash. Then delaid again waiting for staff to appear from somewere to say you 18. Its all time wasting and frustrating open more tills and that includes evening when some folk pop on way from work. And you cant find any staff Unhappy David Edinburgh,2022-05-18
1,"När jag behövde appen i butiken igår laddades den inte. Igår var jag i Lidl och handlade mat och det slutade med att jag köpte drygt 3 000 kr. Jag försökte ladda appen eftersom när man spenderar så mycket pengar behöver man verkligen alla rabatter/bonusar man kan få, men appen vägrade att ladda förbi laddningsskärmen. Nu är jag väldigt arg och upprörd över att jag spenderar 3 000 kr och inte får några bonusar/rabatter, så behandlar man sina kunder :(",2023-03-31

Even if you do win, it is a coupon off something you dont want to buy anyway. Bean counters clearly back in control. Hence down from 4stars to 3 Feb 22 Update.

Only 4 stars sadly as they never have carrier bags for purchase, always running out of there own expensive branded bags too. Plus half the time no shopping baskets available.

1,App was brilliant in the beginning. Always do our shopping at Lidl and the staff are always so helpful and chatty but using the app lately has been dreadful. The number of times the app has been down resulting in losing our £2 and £10 rewards is disheartening. I know it doesn't sound much but when you specifically do your shopping there in order to use this service its very disappointing.,2022-02-05

Co je to za hloupy vynalez v obchodni komunikaci, tykat svym zakaznikum? Copak v prodejne si taky tykame? Dvakrat jsem appku nainstaloval a dvakrat zrusil, to se neda pouzivat.",2021-10-23

5,"A store card that is actually easy to use , no paper coupons to carry round and savings on items I use",2022-06-08
1,Activate vouchers never work. This app should be removed for false advertising. How do these companies get away with promising 10% off this 15% off that for items when none of this actually works. Unless your prepared to basically argue with the staff member and hold the line up while everyone looks at you the discounts never work. Only way to get them to work is for staff member to look at app and then override the till. It takes to long and is an off-putting experience.,2022-09-28

1,Slaba de tot. Nu te poti baza pe informatiile afisate. Incompetenti. Dupa aplicatie magazinele lor au program de la 7 la 22 pe 25 si 26 Decembrie....jenant.,2023-12-24

1,"Często się wylogowuje, skomplikowania w obsłudze, a reklama jak to z aplikacją wielce oszczędzasz to ściema. Wywołuje wspaniałe uczucie jak się okazuje że nie aktywowałeś sobie kuponu bo zapomniałeś. Poświęcony czas nie jest adekwatny do korzyści. 2022-08-01: Brak konsekwencji i partactwo. Jak sprawdzasz jakie kupony dostałeś za punkty to piszą ""Dostępne kupony"" więc szukasz tego kuponu by zdać sobie sprawę że już wygasł... Porażka.",2022-08-01

3,"This app is grand , only thing wrong is the items on scratch and win, they could add more money than 1.00 of next shop, treats, instead of items people don't use , offer items people do use. People are spending enough money in there stores.",2021-11-02

2,The app is very good but still needs work with the following 1) for when shop for just myself £2 off £100 or £10 of £200 shopping is lots of money place so you eg off eg £2 back when you spend £50 add to the account balanceor buy set things 2) it will also be nice to get a item Free when I spend eg £10 for things like birthdays ect 3) also add things when I do small shop due my disbilitys I can't drive,2021-12-04

Also in Serbia we have some kind of lottery and you are not count in in case you didn't activate it in the app, I haven't seen that in the app before and now all my purchases doesn't count at all. This app is not that helpful at all. I'm going to delete it.",2022-08-06

4,It's cheaper,2022-11-24
5,Helpful staff and good prices,2022-04-08
1,Regularly receive emails giving £5 off a £25 shop. When I click to activate they take me to Play Store to download the app that has been installed on my phone for at least a year. Feels like a con / scam. Readers occasionally fail in store so any coupons activated on my phone are not redeemable and there is no way to enter receipt details online. Overall a very poor and disappointing experience. Now shop regularly at Morrisons where prices / quality / unit weights are as competitive.,2022-06-11
5,Its a very good app!,2021-11-06
5,Easy to use,2022-07-26

1,"Was a nice, clear, simple app to use. So many updates make it slower to follow. Overall not bad gives some very good saving. Often I have missed put on the big rewards they come through after I do my shopping. Would be very handy if taken off the total at the till there and then. Would be better if you had say, 10 days to redeem.",2021-11-16
3,"Fairly simple use. However, I am moving to another country so I changed the location of my Lidl store. Which automatically led the app to change to the country's native language. You could at least offer the option to have it in English because I don't understand anything else besides the activation of the coupons.",2023-01-27

4,"Always clean! Needs more staff at the tills. As new customer start shopping at your store because the prices are a better deal, it mean more waiting Time! That's a downer. Not enough workers for information when required by customers.",2022-10-21

4,Good,2021-11-21
1,"There is no reasonable feedback to tell the user the qr code was scanned. A beep while the cashier is registering the items is no good, a green light being slightly more green is also no good, and rely on the cashier is also no good, they'll not always tell you it was scanned. I'm tired of not having purchases registered because of this, tried to contact support and was ignored. Uninstalling this trash and I'll do my best to avoid shipping on LIDL for a long while.",2023-05-23
5,"lidl is a great shop,you can find almost anything.AAAAA",2022-05-11
3,Still getting used to it,2021-10-26
1,I feel violated to have to use an app on my phone in order to get discounts. Its hard to focus on my shopping when the app is distracting. Discounts are not cheaper than bigger package (extra virgin olive oil) or lidls other own brand (dark chocolate),2023-02-09

1,Coupon ist funktioniert im Lidl Filiale ohne Internet signal. Mitarbeiter auch hilft nicht im Bonn Hauptbahnhof Filiale,2021-11-06
1,Can't select language! It shows only regional language cause the language and region are locked together,2023-02-28
5,Staff always helpful in this store,2023-11-01
4,I like it. The only bit I don't really like is how short the coupons last.,2022-03-22
5,Very good shop And clean i cannot see howw you work the £2 £10 if you spend £100 you dhould get £5 not £2 not every one spends £200 this just not fair to other people,2022-03-04
4,Its a good app only criticism is when you do win the coupons its neva things u normally buy,2021-12-16

5,"Straightforward to use, not confusing like some other store apps, clear, concise.",2022-02-18
2,"The app itself is fine with respect to interface and functionality etcetera, but the discounts are pretty lame: 1 free box of biscuits worth 89c for example. I really don't feel it's worth taking the time at the checkout to get the measly benefits of this app.",2021-11-17
5,Excellent App,2022-06-24

3,"Wish it had a shopping list and reminds me when Im in the store; getting old, memory not so good. A reminder if my regular item is on offer? It's happened a few times where the app logs me out. I'm in Lidl and cannot log back in. Coupons unused and no savings.",2022-02-12
1,The deals are just so useless. A bakery item after spending 50 pounds! Not worth keeping the app anymore after they changed the policies on the app. Nectar cards make more sense.,2022-09-28
2,The app is great but since I changed my phone I can not find my store on the app (canary islands) it shows just the mainland so that sucks...can't even use it now. Why is that?!... If somebody could fix that it would be great!,2022-08-14

5,"Very Poor in terms of weekly vouchers. Moreover, these should ve spent in a very limited time ... let's say I've spent £150 on shopping. How can you expect me to go shopping again within 5-7days in order to you my Coupons .... this is Ridiculous 😶😶😶😶",2022-09-29
5,"Exceptional quality service, fantastic people",2023-02-09
5,Good app,2022-04-05
1,I've come to really dislike Lidl plus. The app gives you coupons and then doesn't show them in your available coupons to spend. The rewards you do get expire far to quickly. The whole experience is horrible. It's a reward scheme that makes you work but then swindles you out of your rewards and leaves you feeling irritated. Lidl plus is by far the worst part of the Lidl experience. It would be better not to have a reward scheme than something this annoying. Robbed me for £2 last week.,2023-05-31

5,Wonderful ty,2022-01-27
1,"Slow and clumsy app. Offers often not available. Money off voucher much better than this. Update 23/05/2022. Now worse. New update has to be done or you can't even see offers. Painfully slow.

1,I really liked this app with the savings we could make every month. Now lidl have changed the vouchers and the thresholds it's not worth me using!! As a family with a small child we used to reach the £100+£200 vouchers at the end of the month and a saving of £12 really helped with nappies/ toilet roll every month! Now there's no way we can reach £250 a month with trying to be careful with what we spend. And a free cleaning product every month for spending £100 is completely useless!!,2022-10-29

Lidl Bellingham is excellent all the time they are well stocked and many other Lidls are ok but Catford needs a good manager to stock it properly.

1,"The in-app language is tied to the country where you live. As an expat, I haven't mastered the local language yet and cannot set up the app for myself......... At least let me register in my language or in English. I can scroll the products in the local language. On top of that it's horribly slow.

3,Dont see to be buying things that are discounted so not up to much for me 🤷🏼,2023-10-24
2,Aplikacija (bar u Srbiji) je zastarela. Nudi prevazidjene načine nagradjivanja kupaca. Veliki nedostatak je što je registrovanje putem telefona obavezno što nije baš u trendu sa rastućim zahtevima za zaštitu privatnosti korisnika,2022-03-16
3,Mandatory updates,2022-06-14
1,I am very disappointed with this app. I can't even finish my account set up as it won't send a code to my phone to verify my account. It keeps say we are experiencing a high demand try again later. I've been trying on and off now for 5 days. Sort this out please.,2024-01-23

1,"Basically a waste of time. 4 offers each week, few of which are of much interest. Originally there was a scratch card that occasionally gave you a few pence but that's been replaced with something even poorer. And why do you have to enable each offer? Only reason I can see is that Lidl hope you will forget and not use them.",2021-11-10

2,"Updated review now I've had the app for over a year . The limit time to use the £2 and £10 voucher isn't long enough unless you shop weekly. If, like me, you have to travel out of town to Lidl and do a big shop less often it's almost pointless having app. Most times I don't use it for the reason above. Shame as Lidl is my prefered food shop.",2022-02-26

3,It's not easy to find my way around the elements of the app.... To us older one's who are learning about apps it's not as user friendly as it could be. Ooh I've just remembered I went into the store last month and when I got to the till the cashier said have you got the £5 off a £25 shop coupon on you app.... I didn't know what she was talking about... She finds it on my phone and I was very pleased to receive the discount. I wouldn't have a clue to know where (or when) to look next time.,2023-03-07

3,Good start but the coupons and prizes have too short a lifespan as I shop every fortnight so loose out on a lot of the deals. Would like to see more offers on everyday items rather than branded items,2021-11-04
1,An absolute scam. None of my coupons worked so far nor was I able to claim any of the giveaway items that I earned through my purchases. It would have been more honest to say that they just want to collect data about my shopping habits. It is also ridiculous that the app does not work in Hungary on Sundays.,2022-04-16

3,Not very usefull never works half the time and the vouchers are never what i buy how about giving me vouchers for what i buy.I have had a few freebies but thats on the rewards but im spending loads to get that.Also you cant activate two vouchers for similar items at once and why dont they auto activate anyway come on lidl sort it make it user friendly.,2023-10-20

5,Very good food,2023-11-11
5,One of the easy and no nonsense apps. The only thing not good is that it doesnt work if you use it in a different store to your local store or whichever store you have registered on your app. This means you lose out on the loyalty points if you shop at a different branch which in turn might cause you to fall short of reaching your target to receive your £2 or £10 discount.,2022-02-26

3,It's been months and they still don't support credit card payments making it super annoying to to use because you first have to scan the app and then you need to pull out your card or tap your phone again at another terminal. Also: Every other week there is a popup when I open the app. I would appreciate if it was still possible to open the Lidl Plus QR code while the popup is there.,2021-11-07

Also, I always seem to shop on the 8th day. In other words, I earn plenty of coupons but rarely seem to get to spend them.. Finally - I love Lidl for their decent goods at good prices.

1,"They block 4g, WiFi in the lidl stores so the app doesn't work well when in store",2022-12-15
4,I like the app but do feel that the £2 and £10 off should last longer than 7 days. Once earnt you should be able to use within a longer time frame. Tesco vouchers always have long date and it is much more convenient. Especially if you are wanting to save money off for a special occasion. Seven days Not always convenient especially when minimising number of trips being done to buy food to saver petrol.,2022-04-04

1,This is one of the worst rewards schemes I have ever come across. You hit the spending target for your reward and are expected to rush to the shop within 7 days to claim it. I have never managed to do that in the 5 months since installing the app (i have mobility problems) so it feels like they give and take away. I'm deleting it. Such a sharp difference to Tesco - they are generous and many rewards can be claimed for over a year. I think a month to claim a reward should be an absolute minimum.,2023-06-01

1,"Update : Nothing have changed 🙂 12/27/2022 unlike the competitors of Lidl in Poland ""Biedronka"", the Lidl application in Poland does not contain English for this reason I found a difficulty in registering and adding my bank card, I will not put my bank details and carry out purchases without understanding. I know it's not possible to translate all the products, but the Lidl developers should at least put the menu and the basic settings in English.",2023-09-22

2,After update ow it takes too long to startup!,2024-03-16

3,While the app is good and I am sick to death of going to pay at the till and then being asked to upgrade.This has now happened at least three times and I am not prepared to keep customers waiting whilst the app upgrades and I have now missed out on about £20 00,2021-11-04
1,"Tragical, does not work properly",2021-10-06
2,I like the core idea of having a digital card (saves space). What I really don't like is the requiremet to input my phone number. The customer should be able to choose if he wants to bind their account to an e-mail adress or a phone number (or both if they want it). Make the phone number field optional.,2021-10-02

3,"It's good but sometimes logs me out. it's slow to refresh, too, like you have to close and reopen or go to another page and back to get an accurate idea of your current spend or voucher status.

5,Great Lidl plus,2022-10-28
2,It's ok but the app should be designed with customers choice in mind...i don't see the point of getting discount or free bread/cake when you are coeliac! Just not very beneficial like other store apps,2022-10-20
1,"Aplikacija je ni nalik prvoj koja se pojavila. Cekas da neki artikal bude dostupan a prvog dana akcije ga nema na stanju (nije stigao uopste), ponavljaju se neki kuponi koji te ne interesuju.

5,Great,2022-07-03
1,"I had been using it without issue since it was launched. For the last few weeks I can open the app but not the treats or coupons, so it's a bit useless really. Have uninstalled it and reinstalled it but that didn't work. The support team didn't have any useful suggestions. If I get it working again would like to see improvements in what treats are offered, they are mostly for junk food, and the stock is rarely there anyway. It should tie in with your previous purchases and offer items I'd like",2022-12-31
4,Great app! Only issue is it kicks me out all the time.,2022-06-22
1,Pointless - all there is are occasional 5% discount on salted salmon or hazelnuts. Or spend £1000 for a free croissant,2023-04-01
1,Shown-20% in active coupon but no deduction it made when using it. The cashier said call to the service!! What an idiot service!,2022-08-10
5,"If it goes by what you buy the coupons are not always right, plus I also agree about the £2 & £10 awards should have a longer time scale have missed out on quite a few because couldn't get to the shop within the week especially during lock down, it's not always easy if you have to travel to shop. Got in touch about till not scanning and you very kindly added the £2 coupon to my account thank you very much.",2022-03-10

5,"Really enjoy shopping at Lidls, friendly staff and fantastic prices",2022-04-28
5,"Our favourite shops ,best quality food and also others items cheap and great...",2021-11-21
2,Disappointed with the lack of clarity on what is & what is not included with the coupons. Having to scroll through so many different codes to find out that some items are not included. Recently the shopping list has disappeared so looks like it's back to using paper. All in all not a user friendly loyalty scheme when compared to Tesco or Sainsbury's.,2023-11-21
5,Good,2023-02-24
3,"Since the current update earlier today, the app will not load. It opens up the logo page and has a bit of a think, then it closes the app automatically. It is completely unusable.

5,Amazing prices,2022-02-25
1,"I hate the way that the app makes you jump through unnecessary hoops, such as activating coupons before use. This is particularly annoying for recurring coupons such as the 30% off bakery items after 7pm. Just automatically apply the coupons to the qualifying items in the basket.",2022-03-24

1,"There ses to be no tangible benefit to the customer in using this app. Irrelevant coupons, when you do find one to use it disappears out of the app once activated and the app seems to need almost daily updates for it to function.

1,Leaflets impossible to view - zooming awkward. Coupons not versatile. Disappointing. In some stores the app simply does not open and staff are useless.,2021-11-05
5,So much cheaper than other supermarkets and to receive a £2 coupon for every £100 spent is an added bonus. I will certainly do all my shopping there in the future.,2022-02-23

1,"Hit and miss when this app decides to work. Forget the money saving features because the app doesn't work at times so you miss out on any type discount shopping.. Useless!

So what's the point in trying to achieve the monthly £10 discount if they can't scan your app.",2021-10-08

5,"Now been using the coupons and surprised at the savings they bring. They're not always appropriate for me. I'm sure the more I shop there the better suited to me they will be. I've had some excellent savings with baking products, snacks,biscuits,breakfast cereal etc. When I get those relevant vouchers,which is 9 out of every 10 times, I let family know and then I shop for them too. Just 15% off may not seem like a lot but that soon adds up, well worth using.",2021-12-10

2,The app works well however the coupons that you get through the app are only valid for a really short period. Most of the time they expire before you revisit the store. Also there are only a few coupons available at any one time and often on things you don't want to buy.,2022-12-24

5,Their very good and staff as well are friendly,2021-12-10
2,Vouchers are hit & miss at the till. Also you will NEVER win on spin of surprises ir the scratchcards. Had the app x 3 months never won. Know a few friends who also never win. The discounts should be on items you buy regularly & not on items you NEVER buy. Needs fine tuning . I like Lidl but the app is naff,2021-11-03

1,"Too much updates, and very often. App is running slow, very time consuming.",2021-12-05
3,"Good for the coupons. However, the other app is much simpler to browse this weeks offer, plus you can also see next weeks offer. So why only 3 stars, i much prefer the layout for offers on the other app. So a shame they are taking it away. This app can be quite slow and sluggish at times, but its pretty stable most times.",2024-03-11

4,Lidl coupons used to work fine but recently in store the coupons become inactive even though they appear active at home. I have pay as you go mobile and data are turned off. All of a sudden these coupons even active at home using will find but in store inactive means paying full price. This has been happening recently as I had no problems before.,2022-04-06
4,Nice to see the currently valid offers in the app. At the cash register a paper with my QR code would be faster - if I didn't start the app while queueing then it takes extra seconds while paying. I am not a big fan of coupons but of course it is nice to save a few euros.,2021-10-17

5,Affordable prices always,2022-06-15
1,"I've just reviewed your app and u misunderstood what's said. I went into store to make my monthly spend up to £200 to get my £10 voucher. The app said I had 1 day to do this. So I spent £45 to be told that the month expired the day before, so I got no £10 voucher. Infuriating. And after reading some reviews it seems I'm not the only one this has happened to!",2021-12-13

5,Works well,2022-06-26
1,I'd prefer a physical card. Taking out my phone and opening the app and moving to the scan section of the app is a hassle compared to taking out a second card to swipe when I already have my wallet out. I used the app a few times when it was released but I don't feel like the rewards are worth the effort.,2023-06-06
5,Love the fresh bread in the bakery also fresh fruits are great too,2024-03-07
5,Einfach zu benutzen,2022-07-16
1,Not easy to understand for novices. Says I have rewards and then they do not work. Store workers don't know how to fix problem either,2022-07-25
5,"When app updated some time back, my phone was too old to keep up! Now I have a newer model I'm so pleased to be able to use the app again. It's clear to follow and use.",2022-05-31
3,It's annoying that the coupons only last a week. It's a fifty mile round trip to the nearest supermarket for me and I can't always guarantee to shop in under the 7 days. The amount of ten pound vouchers I have had that have expired is probably around 75 percent so not thatu h of an insensitive for me. The app is ok but reception in store and in store WiFi is not reliable so again we miss out,2022-04-04

5,Love shopping at Lidl just wish they could be more constant with the products notvjust so much and that's it,2022-09-27
5,Think an app on phone is far more convenient for me. Perhaps you shouldn't need to activate coupons though. Should just be automatic. Excellent choice of goods. Do like the new Wilford store as well as Clifton. Why can't I get the green box Formil wash powder anymore? Can't get it at Clifton or new shop,2022-02-26
5,Good shop lots of bargain,2022-10-05

Thought I was missing out on some actual savings not having this app, but I guess it's just a marketing tool unless you're the 1% of Lidl customers who shop there for 'vibes' and not because there's a cost of living crisis forcing you to live on a tight budget.",2024-02-09

1,No Entry - I couldn't even get past the point if select a store. I kept putting it in and it wouldn't accept it in both list and map view. I've had the app on my old phone since inception and tbh can't see the point of it because I never have anything of any worth in it. Also sometimes instore there is no WiFi access so I can't use it anyway. Load of rubbish but I love Lidl anyway so it doesn't really matter about the app.,2024-01-13

2,Too complicated! Used to shop at Lidl every week! Now l go every month after becoming disgusted...trying to figure out how their discounts work! Or more often don't work!,2022-04-11
3,I find the scheme very daunting and complicated! I should not have to remember to download coupons before I shop ! If there is a coupon for everyone to use then why not just activate the coupons at source! If you buy because there is a coupon then good luck If you don't want an item with a coupon then you should not have to check every time before you shop to not activate it ! You see how complicated it a becomes!!,2022-04-28

3,"Definitely improving. Very imaginative and creative graphics. Enticing and effective. It will be better when coupons are more intelligently offered, for example, the algorithms pick up customer preferences more accurately.

1,"Total waste of time from which only lidl benefits. Unlike other reward programs, like TESCO CLUBCARD or ASDA rewards, which allow you to accumulate your savings, lidl savings get lost if you don't use them within a month. As well ASDA and TESCO apply discounts automatically when you scan your clubcard. With lidl you need to search and scan individual offers. So a lot of hassle for nothing, as lidl will take back anything you saved if you don't spend it immediately.",2023-06-15

5,Good way of further saving money on Great Bargains!,2022-09-22
4,"Love this app, but the scratch cards are so much worse than the spin used to be. I don't win most of the time and when I do ""win"" it's always a coupon for something I would never buy. It would be great if it analysed your purchase history and aligned the coupons with what you like.",2021-12-07
5,Exceptional value.,2022-09-28
4,"It might not be so bad if there was in store wi-fi instead of buildings which block your own provider! Annoying that it's awkward to scan so your shopping piles up at the checkout, so I don't always use it then I lose out on the discounts and rewards. Not a lot of replies to all the feedback on this, hey people?",2024-02-05

1,Poor new app did't work,2021-10-13
2,Naurettavat raaputuskupongit ja onnenpyörät vievät turhaan aikaani. Miksi alennuskupongeilla on niin lyhyt voimassaoloaika ja miksi ne eivät siitä huolimatta ole automaattisesti aktiivisia? Itse asiassa kaikki kupongit saisivat olla automaattisesti aktiivisia.,2022-03-24
4,On the whole app is easy to use. I sometimes forget to use coupons especially £2 & £10. A reminder would be useful the day before they expire.,2022-09-04

However, it has many UX issues not limited to: Having to enable deals manually; Deals mostly being limited to only 1 item; Deals expiring weekly instead of biweekly or monthly; Not being able to share and merge coupons from family, as in, when I go shopping I have to split the products into 2 separate transactions; Not being able to sort products by their IDs or names; The leaflets open up in the Chrome app instead within my default browser or within the app",2023-09-29

Palletised goods empty. No water at all, shelves empty. No kitchen roll. I worked for Lidl many years ago. If your area manager came round and found store in such state you would be given such a roasting you would never let it get in that state again.

Some things over the years have gotten expensive we got reindeers tjete before and they were fraction of the price most shops are doing them at that price now but i still love them & most likely end up buyin them.

5,It's a good app giving us information about what is happening at lidl and the offers.,2022-01-06
2,"The app itself is fine & I like how you can tick that you only want electronic receipts (main reason I keep the app). However, over 90% of the coupons are worthless to me. It would be better if they were for things previously bought or if you could customise what you're interested in (like vegetarian or only food related coupons). They also expire way too quickly. I think they should last the entire month. You also don't get any rewards until you've shopped for a ridiculous amount.",2022-12-20

5,"Shopping in Lidls is amazing, saving us pensioners a huge amount. Every month we get £2 and most months £12 cashback as well. Plus the discounts on items along the way. And we can go in the evening and get a discount on bakery items. We go into other supermarkets and I am shocked how much they are charging even for identical items! The quality of Lidls own brands is second to none.",2022-02-25

3,02/03/22 by the way do you actually read these Lidl ? I don't see any replies..... I think that the app is fairly good. However the amount that you are required to spend is fairly high if you are a single person. It is quite easy to spend the £100 and £200 if you are a family. Fairly difficult for a single person don't you think ? As e mailed find that in this day and age the fact that you can't add a receipt to your account is a bit outdated you can with The CO OP,2022-03-02

1,"Lidl Abuse their Chickens! I used to always shop at Lidl until discovering that Lidl raise their chickens in appalling factory farm conditions, using ""Frankenchicken"" breeds which grow unnaturally fast for commercial gain and suffer immensely. Why can't Lidl commit to higher chicken welfare with the Better Chicken Commitment, and stop this unnecessary exploitation and abuse. Won't be coming back until Lidl make this commitment.",2023-01-16

We used to go shopping at lidl and aldi but with the dramatic price increses every week we dont shop here any more, it seems lidl and aldi are in a price fix situation so witchever shop you goto you end up spending the same amount each week.

On the negative points: impossible to activate the promotion 3 grapefruits for the price of 2 and no possibility of changing the language of the application. I imagine that the application exists in English, you could offer a second choice of language to facilitate the use for all the customers.",2023-02-15

1,"At the very beginning, it asks to select a country. And based on the country it changes the language! It's Very old mentality to assume if I'm in a certain county I speak their language too. Have you ever lived abroad? Do you know what an expat is? Are you familiar with Erasmus program? How can I consent to some text that I don't understand?!!! It's ok for a local shop to be old fashioned, but it's not ok for a company with a global footprint be unable to handle localization in the right way.",2021-10-22

1,"Prefer to get money off vouchers in instore booklets the way it was done previous to Lidls App, instead of vouchers which need used within the week. So often lost £10 off because I can't always shop on same day every week due to shifts. Now you are taking this reward away from loyal shoppers so the incentive to shop at Lidl's has waned for me. The money off coupons a waste of time too as never for products I actually buy weekly. New Aldi's in Broxburn will see you lose more loyal customers. 😥",2022-09-21

My last purchase of mini peeler oranges were rotting when i emptied my shopping bag. I am a regular long standing customer.,2022-10-03

1,"There is 10 different criteria to set a password; when I am trying to reset a password every time it says there is an error. It's simply impossible to login. Idk what's the reason putting so much conditions here, I mean who TF will ever try to hack my Lidl account?",2024-01-12
3,The application is fine but they give me vouchers that I don't use or need. I expect for more personalized promotions.,2022-07-03
1,Takes a lot of memory space esp for older people who have pay as u go tariffs very frustrating as although I purchased about £109 in groceries weekly I have no benefit.no vouchers because the apps takes up too much memory and my phone memory is limited.The apps does not cater for those who does not have unlimited access to memory. I feel cheated and I will not be forced to buy more phone memory just for a few voucher.its a scam and is not as equitable like Tesco everyone had access to points,2022-01-05

The way it is at present it takes off a couple of pence off each item purchased... this makes the receipt twice as long as necessary... using double the amount of paper an increased amount of ink required... THIS IS NOT SAVING THE PLANET..... please rectify this issue as its very irritating.. and a ridiculous use of resources..,2021-11-19

1,Lidl Plus is pretty good. Cons - Very often the app is not easy to open in a store. This is huge minus. The other one is that it is not giving the offers based on what I am buing (I am vegan and gluten free person) only they are random and .... meats etc. are dominant. (You can learn about how to manage it from Sainsbury's Smart Shop app ) It is rear that you have offers for fruit or vegetable e.g. . Anyway the offers are in 98% not for me. Which is a shame because I am a good customer.,2022-04-29

1,Can't register... Keeps throwing me back into the app before reg complete. So far this has happened 8 or 9 times mainly from email field but also from age (entering date backwards helps IE year then month then day). Then will not allow address to be entered... I have given up...,2021-12-22

4,"It's very good for a supermarket, most apps are rubbish 👍",2022-08-17
1,"The app requires updates from time to time without stating till when the current version can be used. It seens there's no tech reason for that, as the next minor version (which is also several months old at that time) always works for me. No changelog, always the same BS. Country and language can't be changed independently. No feature to read barcode and check price.",2022-10-07
2,"Letak mogu da vidim samo iz mozile, novim redizajnom ne mogu više da ga vidim, ni učitam u okviru aplikacije 1.8/ Moram da pohvalim srpske programere koji rade na ovoj aplikaciji, jer su promenili onu glupost da stoji nepročitana notifikacija o novom katalogu (jer to pre nije moglo da se ugasi, a potpuno je nepotrebno). Hvala i podršci tima koji vodi lidl na instagramu jer su im preneli moj komentar. Jedino minus, što meni ona čokolada koja se dobija za rođendan u aplikaciji nikada nije stigla",2023-08-01

4,Great for a family but not so for a pensioner. Mum has no mobile phone & never going to spend £200 In a month. Doesn't do www nor online. If the amount was rolling using card or keyring it would help her loads. If Lidl want the support of pensioners please help the elderly a little more.,2021-10-22

2,"Not very reliable in store connection, meaning deals & tokens get missed. Also length of time on money off tokens is too short. Despite shopping every week at Lidl, they only last 7 days & if I go on a Friday one week, I miss out if I go on a Saturday/Sunday the following week.",2022-07-01
2,Darpa menneskeretigheder,2022-11-24
2,Coupon Plus needs to be reassessed. No one's going to spend £50 every month. What makes it bad is that it resets every month. It should carry over for at least 2 months especially with the cost of living crisis. It also doesn't help that you don't sell halal meat. Would've made it easier to hit that target. ASDA Rewards does a better job by letting you earn actually money rather than spending a minimum of £50 for example.,2022-04-29
5,Absolutely love Lidl.,2021-10-01

5,"Great team at Hilsea, especially Emma, always helpful and happy!",2021-12-20
1,Really worthless system. No real value for the consumers out of it since it doesn't offer any cashback or point awards. It only offers few meaningless coupons which by the way you have to manually activate for some reason,2022-10-15

1,"Watch out for the ""FREE"" items when you reach a spend threshold. Lidl DON'T automatically give you these items for free when you reach the spend...you still have to do more work to Activate the Free item on the Lidl app. Lidl rely on a percentage of people (often in a rush) not activating the Free item and paying for it at the till to increase LIdl profits. A more customer valuing strategy would be for LIdl to automatically activate FREE items.",2023-07-07

Products seem ranged for locality, example maybe, Croydon products differ from Horsham, which I feel is proactive and useful. I have yet to use the Lidl Plus coupon or scratch card yet, I'm sure both will be useful and scratch card a bit of fun too. Apologies for my waffle. Kind regards.",2022-11-28

The listing of the products available with the coupons should have pictures alongside their titles. The customer should be given more of a selection to choose from coupon wise. The bakery reduction coupon for 30 per cent off does not work, that needs to get fixed. I like the scratch card feature its gambling without risk.",2022-04-05

Unless you're purchasing special buys from the middle aisle every week you'll never get any money back. I'd say the new voucher scheme is just false economy which isn't what we need atm with the current crisis in the UK,2022-10-05

5,Easy to use,2022-05-23
5,Great app,2021-12-03
1,Annoying to use. Coupons appear with 3 days validity and then disappear after they are activated. The terms change fr month to month. It's so irritating that I may not continue to use it.,2022-07-11

2,Early days so let's see where it goes. Big change well they have increased the £ to 250 which isn't a great idea and you only get 10% of a shop. instead of £10 which was useful now I don't Go in as much because of this.,2022-10-11

I switched to dunnes stores for better savings tbh 10 euro off every 50 spent weekly shop in lidl is 70 euro and no savings, weekly shop in dunnes is 60 euro with savings. Lidl what happened ?

2,"Svako malo - update. Pa dođeš na blagajnu, gužva, ljudi nervozni a ti hoćeš provući karticu, ali kartice nema! Jer se pri svakom updateu aplikacije ona odjavi sa računa! Genijalno rješenje! Da ironija bude potpuna, sve opcije aplikacije su omogućene i kad si odjavljen, osim kartice, pa to ne možeš ni primijetiti ako se baš ne zagledaš. Da priča bude potpuna, nigdje obavijesti o tome da li si prijavljen ili ne, a na početnoj stranici nema ni opcije da se se prijaviš nego moraš tražiti po opcijama",2021-11-06

1,Boo boo,2022-03-29
1,"During COP26, Lidl saw fit to hastily chop down the mature trees on their newly acquired site in Linthorpe, Middlesbrough, seemingly to avoid the community preventing their environmental vandalism. So I won't be using Lidl, or their app, again. I'll choose to use a supermarket which pays more respect to the community it serves and suggest others do likewise.",2021-11-13
4,Good.,2022-08-11
2,Complicated... For people in my age group (77) not very up to date with technology...find a simpler way to reward elderly would be a very good move .,2022-01-07

5,Good so far,2022-08-27
1,This app keeps being updated and does not give you the option of keeping the original one which uses less data. I am unable to update as I do not have sufficient data and will therefore miss out on the deals which makes shopping at lidl much less appealing.,2021-12-02
1,"Keeps coming up in German, and I haven't a clue what it is saying. Pressing on the 'always translate,' button makes no difference. Very frustrating",2023-11-22

Super quality fantastic prices and can't believe the discounts I get on Lidl Plus app too. Well done Lidl and thank you.🙂 One problem is the Lidl app. We need a plastic version for emergencies. I recently lost a scan of about £114 because my phone wasn't working. Another problem is the timescale to spend coupons. It needs to be more flexible.",2022-04-30

4,Good values for money,2021-12-01
5,"Für mich eine sehr nützliche App, weil ich vorher coupons freischalten kann für Angebote die auf meiner Einkaufsliste stehen. Sehr gut finde ich das bargeldlose Bezahlsystem von Lidl (Lidl pay). Nachdem ich den QR code gescannt habe, kann ich in Ruhe an der Kasse meine Waren in den Wagen zurück legen und gehen. Einfach der Kassiererin ""ich bezahle mit Lidl Pay"" sagen und der Betrag wird später vom Konto abgebucht.",2021-12-25

5,Didn't realise how easy it was to use. I have told family and friends to download this app,2022-02-27
1,"Časovo zaostalá, užívateľsky nie príjemná aplikácia. Svieti ako blbá, tyká ako veľmi drzá. Hrôza! Nainštaloval som si ju IBA pre to, že mi Lidl poskytol 5 Eur poukážku. Doteraz však nevedia do nej tú poukážku dostať. Počkám do pondelka - ak nie, odinstalujem toto nevydarené čudo. Žiadna poukážka sa neobjavila a to napriek výzve, zaslanej do Lidl. Tento nepodarok, táto programátorská hanba, ide z môjho smartfonu preč.",2024-01-16

1,Can't load Northern Irelang stores,2024-03-22
5,As usual we have been able to buy everything we needed at discount prices. Veg and meat very fresh and the store was clean. Shame staff are working so hard to fill shelves they don't get time to chat with customers. All staff very friendly at checkout.,2022-02-19
3,The lady at the check out did not ask for me too to put the phone against the app she asked for the payment and then I said can I points she said I should have done it before transaction so I mised out on it spentb46.00 when I asked her she said call customer service to redeem points and thets what I did they said they couldn't do that I'd missed out .

5,Coupons a lot easier with the deduction at til,2022-09-29
4,"The app is a bit unwieldy, you have to activate coupons and scan your phone on a separate scanner. This holds up queues at the tills and the rewards are set at a too high spend requirement and are too small and short-lasting.",2022-07-07

5,Love lidl,2022-02-26
3,"A lot of vouchers not relevant to me, e.g. for baby food, pet food. Should be valid for longer than a week and multi-use, say whole month. I like that it saves your receipt digitally. 19/12/21 Still getting vouchers for meat and fish products although am vegetarian! Small savings on already small prices don't make most vouchers worthwhile. Save more by shopping late and looking for items near use by date that have been reduced by 30%. App can be bit of fiddle to get to scan.",2021-12-19
3,Just getting used to the app. But easy to use. Only annoying thing is that I can't always get mobile data in store to swipe card. Thankfully shop assistant has asked me my mobile number and has done it manually for me,2022-08-06

5,Brilliant.,2023-09-08
4,"A good app. Not a data stealing, price gouging blackmail con like Tesco and Sainsbury's 'loyalty' schemes. You actually get reductions and freebies and they seem relevant to what you buy (maybe anecdotal, but I often get discounts on things I buy often). One improvement I would like to see is an 'activate all' button so I don't have to go down the list clicking on all the discounts",2024-03-07

1,"Não admira que tenham de introduzir uma ""cenoura"" para aumentar a adesão à app. Cada vez que a tenho de utilizar numa compra pede autenticação, pois foi atualizada e o perfil não se manteve autenticado. Só hoje demorei 5 minutos a fazer reset à password, enquanto o caixa e os clientes desesperavam. Há claras oportunidades de melhoria neste programa de fidelização.",2021-10-24

1,Um Rabatt zu kriegen von bestimmten Artikeln muss man vorher ein Coupon aktivieren.,2024-03-30
1,Τα κουπόνια που δίνει μπορεί να χαθούν καθώς η λήξη τους είναι πολύ σύντομη και πρέπει να έχεις το νου σου να τα ενεργοποιήσεις ή έχουν κάπου με ψηλά γράμματα ότι αφορούν π.χ. αγορές άνω των 20 ευρώ. Αυτό το τελευταίο αφού πατήσεις να δεις λεπτομέρειες χωμένο μέσα σε άλλα. Κακη εμπειρία πελάτη. Δεύτερη φορά που χάνω κουπόνι έτσι.,2023-08-09
5,Always happy with my purchases from Lidl,2024-01-26
1,I am Very low on memory but Lidl insist on updates,2022-08-17
1,"nie lubie tej aplikacji. konto zakładałam 40 minut i nie moge kupić żelek shreka przez aplikacje co jest głupie, bo mam nogę w gipsie i poruszam sie na wózku, przez co ciężko mi się poruszać, i iść do sklepu, więc fajnie by było gdybym mogła zakupić jedzienie online. nie polecam i nie pozdrawiam. pocałujcie mnie w mojeje kółko napędowe.",2022-09-23
3,Disappointed that recent prize draw competition winners names and county have not been published as promised in the T & C's. There was supposed to be a link provided on the App but I have not noticed it yet.,2022-02-22
2,"Overall it's okay. Areas to improve: 1) Automatically activate all coupons. 2) Increase the one week validity period on the £2 & £10 vouchers to say one month or at least two weeks. Above was before they removed the £10 voucher. With the £10 voucher gone, the other incentives offered won't cut it for me. I feel disappointed and may just start using Aldi.",2022-09-08

1,"Ho pensato che lo scopo unico dell'app fosse conservare le ricevute digitali per la garanzia o il reso dei prodotti. Mi sbagliavo! Puoi restituire i prodotti utilizzando le ricevute digitali presso i negozi LIDL in altri paesi, ma in Italia non è possibile. Da Ikea, invece, puoi effettuare il reso e usufruire della garanzia utilizzando la ricevuta digitale. Ma presso LIDL in Italia hai bisogno della ricevuta fiscale cartacea. In pratica, l'applicazione LIDL non ha alcun senso, è inutile.",2023-06-08

3,"It's good that the free bakery item tier has been added, as I very rarely achieved the £100 spend, let alone the £200.",2022-11-27
4,"It's easy to use. I marked it down a star because the coupons can be a little disappointing. There are 3 Lidl's local to us and not one of them received into stock a new food item that I had a coupon for. Plus, the coupon offers tend to be more for sweets and cereal type products. I guess apps like this record what you buy and then offer coupons for the things you don't buy to encourage you to buy more products. It's not good though encouraging people to buy food high in carbohydrates.",2022-07-17
2,Trotz mehrmaliger Beschwerden beim Kundenservice kann ich Lidl Pay nicht einrichten. Diese Funktion steht mir nach Änderung meiner Bankdaten nicht mehr zur Verfügung.,2022-08-12

2,"Didn't add one of my shops to spend and therefore lost savings opportunity. More empty shelves and offers on app not stocked in my local shop.

1,"Pretty useless reward scheme. I don't know why lidl bother, they should save the money and cut prices as that is their competitive advantage. The app is useful as an electronic receipt store and an electronic advert otherwise don't bother.",2023-01-21

5,East to use and it might not seem like a lot but the savings build up and it's definitely worth it. We do our most of our shopping at lidl so regularly spend enough to get the money off coupons which is always a bonus,2022-02-10

1,"The app only works if there is WiFi. I can't get it to connect to the store WiFi. So instore I'm unable to see which offers I have activated. Customer Support suggested I make a note of these elsewhere before coming into store.... Really? It also means I can't use time-based offers if those activate when I'm in the store. I have contacted Support about this but no further forward. I have reinstalled, cleared cache and everything else suggested. Now, my question is, why can't this be fixed?",2023-09-23

2,Need to sort out their coupons. I got two coupons for two different things (Coupon Plus and Birthday) and they claim they're 'incompatible' so I have to go round twice. I can't believe this isn't resolvable - it's obviously been left in place so they can appear generous safe in the knowledge that only half of their 'generosity' will ever be used.,2024-03-09
2,"Misleidend, ""korting met Lidl Plus app"" werkt alleen als je handmatig elke korting activeert. Misleidend, irritant, tijdrovend en onnodig. Een klant wil altijd korting! Waarom zou je in hemelsnaam een korting handmatig moeten activeren. Kwestie van tijd voor ze op deze misleidende praktijken worden aangeklaagd.",2023-03-03

1,Descriptions for items are vague with a tiny image. The store also almost never has the discounted items. Kinda pointless. Used it for a month and saves like 1 whole euro.,2022-06-25
1,Warum muss ich Coupons aktivieren damit die Aktions Preise gelten? Ich habe doch schon die Lidl plus app genau deswegen. Wurde mit Wünschen einfach zu scannen und was mit der catd in Aktion ist zieht einfach am der Kasse nach. Manuell jeden Artikel raus suchen und man kann die Artikel auch nicht mit einem Suchfeld manuell eintippen und suchen... ist für mich unbrauchbar und macht eine gute Idee unnötig kompliziert und werde ich auch nicht weiter nutzen falls das nicht verbessert wird.,2023-08-23

1,"This app became awful. At first was working very well, but now works poorly or not at all. You can't use your offers or activated cupons în the app. Bad experience for several times, I wont try to use it in the future, because it makes me feel frustrated to have the same discussions with the stuff, over and over again.

1,"The first days of its application have been chaotic and useless. The cashiers did not have time to tackle the consumers' queries, the idle security have not been instructed to help in any way, the application did not work in the shop though you downloaded it the day before. Very poor start!",2022-03-07
3,Went to Lidl on 31/12/2021. Tried to use the Lidl Pkus card at checkout. Didn't work. Asked for help. Couldn't help either. Asked me to tap the number myself. Unfortunately my eyesight is too poor to see the small print of my card number. So Lidl please make the system work or is it just a con. It happens quite a few times. Most time staff are helpful and tap the number. Don't need help if card works,2022-01-02

2,I try to use this only to scan my QR code at the checkout. It can take 30-40 seconds to move on from the splash screen on a Samsung S22 Ultra which is just about the most powerful smartphone in the world. Seems it doesn't work if there's no WiFi or phone signal. Pretty unusable I'm sorry to report.,2023-02-28
3,Seem to have PROBLEM,2022-04-28
5,Very good,2022-07-13
2,Absolutely pointless app. NEVER seems to work when I need it. Always hangs when you most need it... at the checkout... holding up the queue (which goes down like a lead balloon!) Why not have an option to keep the user logged in permanently or still allow you to access your QR code even if it can't get an Internet connection?,2022-09-10

1,"One of the worst loyalty apps I've ever had. Coupons are a total hit and miss despite my shopping preferences. You get £2 off coupon only if you spend £100. When you want to use it, it often doesn't work. Now, after they did another fix, it's worst than before. Can't even log in. Won't be using it again.",2021-10-11
1,"Why are You having 2 apps (Lidl and Lidl Plus)?? I logged in Lidl webshop, then this one (Lidl Plus) keeps asking me to""Login or register"" ..... I DID NOT SEE A REGISTER BUTTON !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Seriuosly, what kind of people designed this ?",2022-02-24

2,"It's quite anoyng that we shoud activate coupons. Big disadvantage is lack of shopping list. Preview of special offers by category were better organized in Lidl app. I hardly found them in Lidl plus app. On the other hand, I really like ""the best time for your shooping"" tool.",2022-04-02

1,"Items are missing from shelves for long periods now and gone back to the scratch card but its not like the original, at least you won now and again. Theres very little winning differance to the spin wheel which was rubbish. update, so you take away the £10 coupon when you spend £200 and replace it with 10% when you spend £250. Which means you now have to spend £350 to get your £10 discount, HOW PETTY IS THAT! SORRY BUT MY RATING HAS NOW GONE DOWN TO ONE ⭐ Thinks I will be shopping more at aldi",2022-10-08

1,"This app was very good at the start, now the rewards they give you are absolutely rubbish. They are getting tighter and tighter by the month, I mean a 70p bar of chocolate for spending £150 is a joke, you used to get a 10% off voucher before (now £250 spend). I use Aldi now, no app but cheaper and better quality food",2022-12-23
4,Some great offers available on this app..,2022-01-02
5,Works fine as long as WiFi works in store or a signal can be received by my phone,2022-02-25
4,Sometimes app or shops scanner doesn't work ie at beginning of month missed out on £28 shopping showing on target line so will probably miss out on £10 off for £200 shop - should be able to keep receipt and have added on when shops scanner working later surely,2021-10-12
1,"The instore readers do not read the digital receipt barcodes. App vouchers are mostly useless and for stuff I don't buy. Rude grabby staff at your store who try to grab your phone to angle it...which is fine if you want you or your stuff to be touched by them (I don't, thanks). Perhaps teach your staff to use their speech centres to indicate what the problems with your readers are. All in all, just terrible. I won't return to this store because of this experience.",2024-02-16

2,Reached the £200. Activated my £10 off. Scanned it…spent another £41. Didn’t work. The scanner never picked it up. I asked the lad on the till if it had scanned at the beginning and he said it had. There’s often a big queue so it’s had to argue your case. Not as flash as it appears.,2021-10-01
4,Very helpful service,2022-10-06
2,"Need to be able to update before trying to pay for shopping. The only notification an update is available is when I open the App whilst checking out. The upgrade then won't install, leaving me with no option but to cancel and not scan Mt Lidl Plus card. This means I lose any benefit that I may have available today and possibly in future. Don't get a digital.receipt either",2023-02-18

I've restarted the phone, & uninstalled & reinstalled the app 3 times but no change. Ridiculous. Instead of making us update every 5 minutes why not just make the app work properly in the first place. I'm off to Aldi. UPDATE: 10 days later, still the same. Red band on page saying 'no Internet connection'. Asked them at my local Lidl, they just said, ""Yeah, the app is s**t.""",2024-02-29

1,"Since the rewards system has been changed its not worth the space on your phone. There's little point using this app now.

1,Keep losing my discounts and both the store and customer services don't want to resolve. Why run loyalty schemes and then fail to apply. These issues have been going on for a long time. Store and customer services just wash their hands of it. I think I may report to trading standards. How does that response help. My voucher hadn't expired. Your system failed to apply the voucher both on the self checkout and with the colleagues at the counter. Who just sent me away and then customer services,2022-10-11

NIL...NADA....ZIP DIDDLY SQUAT...ZERO... TRIED to get it resent....🤡 Got to a warning that if I ask for a resend ""1 more time"" I will be locked out for 24 hours. It's AWEFUL.

5,So easy to use,2022-06-03
2,Rubbish the app is okay but Lidl needs to be better than that STOP using coupon system START using points like Tesco. The money we spent convert into points then we use this points to buy coupon that is fair trade IF we don't use the points we keep but with this coupon system if you don't use you 10% or rewards coupon by the end of the month you loose them NOT good enough LIDL,2024-01-11

3,Difficult to get into and out of if you are against the traffic flow. A set of lights would enhance safety. Also no direct footpath for walkers as one must walk across the car park. A designated public footpath or a safe crossing area would improve the risk of accidents,2023-02-15

I still use other supermarkets for items not available in Lidl but Lidl is now my shop of choice.",2023-08-05

5,Easy to you,2022-07-09
5,Has got better as it's settled in and wifi is available at the store now. Item availability for a given coupon is the only real problem now. You get a scratchcard for each time you go to store. A possible improvement might be to only issue a winning coupon instead as I'm sure most people don't want to scratch 9 cards to find one win only to then find the product is out of stock. e.g. Haven't seen dessicated coconut for months now.,2022-04-26
5,Always good. And great staff ALWAYS!!,2022-05-03

5,Shame the rewards and coupons are not useful. Most of the things are junk with subsidised oils. Which means no bakery or processed food rewards which means can't use the reward. Need to spend 100 to get 2£ for the next hurdle. What's the point of having a 50 hurdle where you only offer what you want a person to eat. The whole point is having choice. You might as well give 1£ off instead. I'm not gonna eat bakery with rapeseed palm or sunflower cause nearly every pre made product has it.,2022-07-21

Do toho kupóny ""na míru"", které vůbec neodpovídají mým nákupním zájmům. Nebo ""výhodné"" kupóny, kterými jenom upozorňujete na nové výrobky v sortimentu ale jinak nejsou žádnou odměnou za používání apky, si strčte někam.

1,"Treat items if a preference of your own are always sold out, no matter time of day. As retailers cover themselves with ....while stocks last! Absolutely no need to activate treat as its not like Lidl are keeping that item in stock just for you. 80% of the time I did not benefit from any discounts & found I spent extra money in a more expensive store grocery and household supermarket.

1,"I give up. Where can I search for an item. I'll shop somewhere else while you let me know. Vicki, you're not understanding what I'm saying. The app does not have a search function.

5,Easy to use and great offers included. Only problem I've had is getting a signal in the store. To use the app in store you need to log onto the stores wifi or have all your coupons activated and take a screenshot/photo of your QR code to scan at checkout. Best to do one or both of these BEFORE you go into the store to prevent any problems.,2022-04-05

1,"Nothing like tesco, you cant keep your coupons because they expire in a week. You can only use it if you spend more than £10 and the rewards yiu get back are not work it, you get pennies off your shopping, not worth the phone space to be honest I'll be uninstalling it",2022-12-15

5,App very easy to use.,2022-06-30
3,"Meh? Mixed reviews. Achieving the targets is clear, however getting th rewards is unnecessarily clumsy. I suspect deliberately. Instead of allocating your £2 / £5, 10% discount coupon when you've spent enough, you not only have to find the coupon, then add it, you then have to go back in the app, then activate it, a step which is quite frankly totally unnecessary, hence whyi think this is deliberately added, so that you likely will inadvertently not activate it before a big spend, at I did!!",2023-01-24
4,I like the regular updates and promotions although not all are relevant to our needs as a retired couple. I enjoy making use of the veg/fruit boxes priced at £1.50. Plenty of scope to batch cook.,2022-05-28

4,The store is well stocked and staff very polite and helpful. However I imagine that they are currently short staffed due to the sorry state the milk fridge was in today.Presumably a carton had split as there was milk dried on the glass doors. The app is easy to use and the money off coupons soon build up.,2022-11-11
1,I think the money off coupon reward scheme is totally unsatisfactory and grossly unfair in allowing only 7 days to use the coupons. I am aware that I have lost the benefit of several of these coupons because I have not been able to visit a store within 7 days. The scheme is based on the customer's monthly spend and it should give at least a month to use the £2 and £10 money off coupons. The fact that I happen to be a disabled pensioner makes it more difficult but that is incidental to the issue.,2021-11-29
4,From time to time it has some good points. Down side when you reach a voucher goal they take it away in seven days,2021-12-18
1,"App asks you to update and don't let you go further without update. It's crazy because when many people waiting in que and I start updating app, can make everybody annoy. Come on what is emergency that app everytime act like this.",2022-03-20
4,"Good app, great rewards, can be a bit slow.",2022-01-29
3,"Used to be much better. They give you scratch cards when you shop, but rather than money off like they used to give, it's 70p off a random product you don't want... Which would have been considered a general offer anyway... Bring back the money off shopping... Much better",2021-12-06

2,I'm not sure if they actually check what people buy cause half the things I get coupons for I have never bought and probably never would. I have also noticed when I do a 'big shop' I literally just get in the car and get notification of money off voucher that is only valid till the next day. Not impressed.,2022-12-15

3,"Pretty good deals, there's at least 2 or 3 a week that my wife and I make use of. We have had a number of instances where the coupons we've used have not registered when we've scanned our app, this doesn't affect the final total much, but it is confusing and a little frustrating that we are missing out on 15% or so here and there. The scratch coupons feel pointless, we've had so many lately and they were all duds. The bakery roulette is a better system because you always win, instead of a maybe",2023-10-18
1,"Okay, what the hell happened here? I haven't been able to use the app whatsoever for a couple weeks now as it signed me out forcefully and doesn't let me sign in anymore.

3,"A good idea that does away with the need for a plastic card. However, there's usually a problem and this app is no exception. You need a good mobile phone signal, otherwise you can't activate your discounts or even use your 3D barcode that needs to be scanned. The solution is to activate the offers before you enter the store and screenshot your personal barcode. Otherwise, you're stuffed ...

1,"App isn't worth having, neither is the loyalty card. You scan and sometimes it dosent give you the discount off the coupons. Coupons expire far too early so you usually don't get a chance to use them. The weekly vouchers they send are of stuff you probably won't buy anyway & with the scratchcard thing, they don't give you anything, you just get another useless voucher of 15% off stuff they can't sell. Shame that the loyalty scheme isn't as good as places like tesco and sainsburys",2022-08-18

5,Nice app,2022-01-06
2,"Having to manually activate coupons is stupid and seems like a way of catching people out rather than rewarding loyalty. I would prefer the coupons to be based on more of the common items I buy instead. Points and coupons should rollover, rather than expire. Another good feature would be being able to scan an item and have the app tell you if its part of a coupon discount.",2023-08-24

1,"Too fiddly to have to open up app and use and very easy to forget to scan. Also, don't like anyone else touching my phone during covid which sometimes happens when staff are trying to assist with app. A small card for a key ring would be much more user friendly",2021-09-30

5,"Great app. Finally I can save few quid on my favourite shop. However it would be easier if coupons activate automatically. I don't mind browse them, bit then you have to activate them. Lot easier if they're coupons would be already activated and I'm choosing whether to buy or not to buy product in offer. Thanks Lidl.",2022-06-29

5,Easy to use,2022-08-17

1,How do I update my Lidl app when it won't allow my phone to update? My android mobile is 6 years old and I certainly won't be buying a new one just to download this App. Shame on you Lidl for causing so many problems.,2021-09-30
2,Doesn't seem worth it unless you're a parent with a child in school or want a free chocolate bar every few weeks. Thought there'd be a points system like other supermarkets with discounts or coupons but I've been using this for two months and haven't really benefitted at all.,2023-09-07
4,Great shopping place with quality goods. Downside never have any Capachino pods on the shelves. Could do with more fat free goods.,2022-02-24
2,I have found that many coupons on the app are not available when I go to purchase the item.,2022-06-28
3,I have moved to Sweden and tried to install this app. It would have been nice to have English as an option since I do not understand Swedish yet and same case with many of my friends. Even copy option is disabled to use Google translate. Language settings would have been helpful. Probably now I am going to uninstall due to this.,2023-03-23

5,"Amazing. Simple to use and many nice benefits and features, such as coupons, battle pass and and mini games with rewards",2022-12-17
3,Please make the saved coupons available offline. There is no network inside the shops and I don't remember what coupons I have. Also would be nice to have tailored offers based on what I already buy. I'm vegetarian but 90% of coupons I'm given are to buy meat 🤣,2022-10-08

1,The use by period for vouchers is too short. I would expect a 2 or 3 week period to be more helpful.,2022-04-20
3,"Its ok. Giving coupons that you don't use at all would seem to me to be a bit of a donkey way of trying to get your shoppers in. The £2 quid off or 10 max is also a bit of a joke. Thanks for giving that to me but I don't live close to a lidl therefore i spend a good amount stocking up so I don't have to go every week. Dare I say it, tesco now put it on your bill straight away, they used to do coupons and you could use them up to 2 years from the date,not with lidl. Could go on and on ......",2022-02-17

1,"Was bringt mir der Rabatt, wenn die Preise im Lidl falsch hängen? 1€ Rabatt, aber dafür bezahlt man 1€ mehr, weil die Preisschilder falsch sind? Entweder kriegt ihr es hin vernünftig analoge Preisschilder auszuhängen oder baut einen Produktscanner in die App!! Nervig. Und erstellt endlich einen ""alle Coupons aktivieren"" Button!!!",2023-12-14

1,"От две, горе долу ставащи приложения да направиш едно, с толкова садистичен UI и UX е колосално постижение. Първо не можеш да си отвориш картата за отстъпки по 15 секунди, заради някакви безумни реклами, и то докато чакаш на касата и губиш времето на персонала и хората на опашката. Второ менюто е като наръчник за атомна централа. Трето никакъв UX в секцията за избор от текущи промоции. Четвърто, никакъв ред и интуитивност. Пето, липсват интегрирани платежни методи.

5,Easy to use,2021-12-14
2,"I think your loyalty card and the points you can earn should offer the chance to use them over a longer period. To get a 10 pound voucher you have to spend 200 pounds in a month but then need to go back within 7 days or you lose the 10 pound ""reward"". Madness",2022-07-30

Sorry ale keď nakupujem, nemám čas sa je*bať s týmto a čakať v Lidli na ""skúsiť neskôr"", potrebujem zaplatiť a odísť.

Out of all the shopping, you save like 1.00 or 50c and you've spent more than 100e already. They make you spend more and you get to save less. Totally doesn't make sense.

3,"Needs to stop with the catalogue scans! Good for tracking spending and nice to get coupons, but the app fails when it comes to viewing the ""middle of lidl"" and superweekend deals. Easier viewing the mobile version of the website on your phone than the clumsy catalogue scans in the app - if they can do it right on the website, why not the app? Same issue on android and iOS versions.",2022-05-28

1,"Have not been able to use this app yet when asked to scan my code at the checkout, everytime the app has an update meaning it can't be used and takes an age to download, you think I'm going to wait whilst people are waiting for me, nope. So what is the point??? Suggest the app can still be used at least to scan its code whilst it has an update pending.",2022-04-24
1,"Uninstall... Why bother I spent with app! As there time limits or lose, out. Tesco app no limit,spend discount/coupon simple.",2022-01-25

There is no any very important personal data kept to require this. Please make the app not to require login after every update or at least use biometric login.

2,No signal in store. It was first time use but didn't work for me. As it was first time I gave it 2 stars and not 1. If it's betternext time I'll change review.

2,"The old app was good, getting a £2 voucher and then a £10 voucher when you reached a £200 spend. I think the new version is very poor. Having to reach a £250 spend to only get a 10 per cent discount of your next shop is poor unless you are spending a lot in one go. Very disappointed with the new app.",2022-09-15

1,Have tried 4 times to download this app and still haven't managed it!!,2022-04-04
2,Not up to much for me as alot of the offers are for stuff we don't usually buy. Also not happy that they took the £10 off your shopping away and replaced it with 10% didn't highlight it and put the spend up to £250.,2022-12-20
1,"Nothing much here for Vegans as most coupons they provide are for useless animal violence products that harm animals, planet and human health. LIDL really needs updating its 2023 and in 2010 UN said an urgent shift to veganism is the best way to save our world. Dairy and egg industry kills babies for milk which you get from plants easily. You get all nutrients from plants. Why sell animal meat when plants prevent cancer, alzheimers, parkinsons, covid, heart disease, diabetes?",2023-05-21

The app is easy to use, I'm not great at technical use so it's ok for me and as I'm not fully able I like to be able to take my time looking at goods. The app helps me make decisions on what I may buy before I shop. Nothing to do with the app but just to say I would probably buy more at Lidl if there was a facility for helping me pack and load my car.",2021-12-23

1,"NE KUPUJTE U LIDLU!!! Aplikacija ne radi kako je predviđeno. Pri kupivini se ostvaruju popusti nakon određene sume potrošenog novca. Meni se desilo da sam popust ostvario, ali mi se popust nije pojavio u vidu kupona. Pretpostavio sam da se popust obračunava na kasi. To nije slučaj. Kada ih pitate za razlog neobračunavanja popusta ne znaju da vam daju odgovor i upućuju vas na call centar. Ako kupovinu obavljate u večernjim časovima call centar nećete dobiti. Vrlo neprofesionalno!",2022-12-16

3,"The App in itself is fine. However, as your customer complaints is already aware from my very recent letter and phone conversations, getting Wi-Finished connection in our local store is unreliable! This of course means that any discounts through this App are lost! The store is: HASTINGS, Bohemia Road, East Sussex.",2021-11-15

1,OK but constantly wants to be updated which is made as difficult as possible.,2022-02-25

3,"Brilliant. So easy to use and really good rewards. This was my initial impression however after using it for some time the system is unstable and inflexible. On a number of occasions when I have scanned my card it seems to have taken, and the cashier says it has, but it hasn't. So my total hasn't been added and this can make the difference between achieving the £2 or £10 voucher in a month. AND surprisingly there's no way this can be rectified later even though I have a paper receipt.",2021-11-18

4,"Had the app from day 1, never had any major issues, never been logged out! I activate coupons as soon as they are available so when you scan the QR card no waiting around. You can scan this anytime during the transaction. Sadly some people don't understand technology and don't have the patience to understand. Just blame the app etc. Some of the winning coupons could be a bit a bit more varied as I don't use many of them but overall nice little app 👍",2022-04-04

1,I had previously given five stars as it was a great app when it started but they have changed it since Christmas and in my opinion it's only to cater to the people who spend a lot of money in one go in their shops. Most of the treats used to be good and helpful to struggling people but now it's that you get a free bag of 70 cent taytos if you spend 30 euro. What about the single or elderly people who don't need to do a whole weeks shop and instead just go every couple of days? Aldi better value.,2023-02-02

1,You may want to fix this app. It crashes every time I try to use it.,2023-01-02
4,A lot of the vouchers are for things I don't buy. It would be better if they were based on your previous purchases like the Co Op ones are. I can't use them very often as we don't have a Lidl near. We have to go to Aberystwyth which is a 60 mile round trip. I love Lidl but wish we had one locally.,2021-11-04

2,While every small cost reduction is welcome this app should make it easier to save even on the very limited items available. Reductions should be automatically deducted from your bill when the card is scanned instead of users having to go in to the app and manually activate every individual item prior to purchase. Other supermarkets have managed much more with their loyalty cards for many years so come on Lidl.,2022-07-25

5,Always great,2023-02-14
1,Pointless now - Since Lidl changed the T&C's of the plus card there's no real benefit to bothering with the app: a few coupons for products you don't use or want? 10%off your next shop once you've spent over £250 which expires before you use it - or can amount to next to nothing. We no longer bother scanning the virtual card and will be deleting the app,2023-02-14

2,Too much faff at till. Opening and checking off coupons is a pain. Till knows what you have bought. App knows what coupons you have. Should auto use coupons that are applicable rather than holding up the queue checking through them all. Never helped by often poor phone signals in stores or a sudden 'need to update'. Rarely use it due to the above,2023-05-10

1,App itself is okay but to get your card to show in most Lidl's you have to turn your Internet off as it takes forever to load (metal building and mobile data dont go well especially on the 3 network) Shops wifi is a joke with them failing to give IP to connect to it all the time. By not being connected the vouchers don't work so it's a case of why use it when the rewards are not being given out. Vouchers you do get are also not relevant to what you buy and most are for things you won't want. 😩,2022-04-11

The items that are on offer each week most often aren't the items that I wish to buy. So since I don't buy them I don't save. I also shop in Supervalu and they offer various ways to reward you for your custom. They offer items with a discount each week like Lidl, they do a shop and save voucher each week and they also give you money back vouchers 3 times a year.",2022-02-26

4,Nice app but can why on monthly basis and not overall spending all along,2022-12-25
2,Pretty pointless App really. Coupons are almost always for products I wouldn't buy - perhaps that's the point - Lidl want you to try stuff you haven't had before! Most useful item is a free item from the bakery - I choose the most expensive loaf which is only available if you're in the store early in the day. What's the point of 30% off bakery when it can only be used at end of day when there's nowt worth having left!,2022-12-23

5,3 times I have had to reset my password at checkout because I have been logged out unexpectedly and I am unable to remember a 10 character password with a special character. Impossible. So app needs to stop logging us out or require a simpler password. I find it hard enough to remember to take my phone in! I have girl pockets.,2022-03-30
1,Keep loosing voucher's,2022-09-20
2,The app is great when it's not needing an update but a few times recently I've found I have done a large shop and when I get to the checkout I can't use the app as it needs an update. So I lose the benefits of the monthly add up . Surely it can be set up like other apps where you can choose update later so it can be used that time and updated later not losing that shops benefits and digital receipt? My store always reminds me to use the app and It's really annoying when I can't for updates.,2021-11-10

1,"This review used to be 5 stars, and this app was the ideal I held all other stores to. Now they've started logging you out whenever the app updates (which is very frequently). Every time I go to a LIDL and try to use the app, I am logged out again, and the login+password process has problems so I have to give up on the app or holding up the queue for several minutes. When I come home, it tages ages but the password eventually gets working. Then a week or 2 later when I'm in a LIDL store again, I'm logged out and the newly reset password doesn't work again. This app was excellent, but after a year of trying to still make it work, I've given up on it. It's simply not worth my time to go through a broken login and password recovery process every time I want to use it.",2022-05-21

2,New stamp competition good concept with nice prizes but not thought out well since only one stamp can be earned per transaction. Unitended consequence will be people ringing up £10 3x + during one shop so as to garner 3x stamps backing up queues at the tills. I.E 3× ringups 3x clubcard scans 3x payments! Stamps ought to be issued for each £10 within a transaction so a single ringup for say £32 would net me 3x stamps. So now ill have to break that £32 into 3 x >£10 ringups to get my 3 stamps !!?,2022-01-09

I did like the simplicity of the app however, without access to the app I can no longer benefit. I would propose a alternative as other reviews mention issues too.

1,"Terrible registration system. I forgot my password, requested a new password, did it, and then, I had to register again! I added my phone number, and guess what, it's already taken:D not only they ask for your address, phone number, and even a difficult password,so you can not remember it two days later.

5,Good. Easy to use.,2022-11-06
2,It kind off does the job but am really annoyed by the forced use of Chrome when you click something in the app. Even if I have another browser as my default it insist it only wants Chrome. It should be up to the user what browser to use to open something.,2023-07-29

1,Lidl app is a waste of time the scratch card thing is rubbish and the points thing are rubbish. Lidl offer you stuff for free or exchange for points earned and guess what the items you select or won are unavailable when I comes to getting them in store... Also Lidl's new displays for prices in store are deliberately small so you can't read unit prices overall a company to avoid,2023-11-03

5,In the last 3 weeks I redeemed 3 vouchers sent through Lidlington plus for £17.00 in total. The downside it logged me out and I could not log back in so missed an €80.00 shop.,2022-08-26
3,"The app itself is great, but it is unfair that you have to use the offer within the same calendar month. I am a person who shops at the month and I can not get any offers at all. I personally recommend that the offers and the vouchers are valid for 30 days from the date of issue",2023-01-11
1,"All the so called prizes on the scratch card are the offers you get anyway, hardly worth using. Trying to be like the tesco club card and falling way short. The one good thing is that you can have a paperless receipt, but that's if the staff in the stores actually pay attention and don't print one off for you. This app could be so much more but is falling way short of its potential. Dare I say it, it's a bit spursy.......",2023-04-09
4,"It's interesting to see what is available on the weekly magazines, instead of having to collect instore. Some of the special offers are useful so I validate all offers everytime. Update - most of products advertised in Lidl mag are rarely available, I think it's just to get people in the shop. They're called Loss Leaders.....",2024-01-23

2,"The Lidl app itself is fine, seems to work exactly as it should. What I have noticed both in-store (the weekend offers which used to run Fri - Sun have completely stopped) and on the app the vouchers (issued every Thur) are for such obscure items, which you will hardly if ever buy. They used to be for every day items, which you would buy on a weekly/fortnightly basis, which would come in real handy. But now I can't remember the last time I activated a Thursday voucher, it's all a bit rubbish now",2023-01-25

3,I have no issue with the app itself. However after reaching the £250 target and receiving the 10% off coupon. I am given insufficient time to use it. Surely the 10% off coupon should be valid up until the end of that month once achieved and 7 days only if achieved later in the month. Ive lost out again.,2023-01-26

1,"Wurde schon mehrfach um Preisrabatt im Lidl in Freyung geprellt. Daten abgreifen, aber den Rabatt nicht geben. Lidl hat mich so schon um insgesamt 50Euro betrogen. Auch super: Datenlöschung steht falsch im FAQ (Geht nur telefonisch Oder per email), dort steht nur man soll sich abmelden und nach 2 Jahren inaktivität dann Löschung. Ist auch so illegal. Am Telefon selbe abwimmel Versuche am Beginn. Absoluter Betrügerladen. Finger weg.",2023-06-02

1,"Por dios, solo quiero hacer mi compra en línea y es imposible conseguir los productos.
