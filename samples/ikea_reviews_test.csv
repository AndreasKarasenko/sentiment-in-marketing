5,"Just what I need to prepare for a trip to IKEA. Helps me find what I want and where to find it. If an item is out of stock at my store, the app lets me know and allows me to be notified when it's available.",2022-12-06
5,Very user friendly!,2019-11-26
2,"Why is the language linked to the land? Why am I not allowed to select land as 'Germany' and choose my language of preference (i.e. German or English or Spanish etc.)? Also, why am I not allowed to change my newsletter subscriptions? Upon installing the app, it is turned 'on' by default so that I receive emails and the app does not allow me to switch this off??",2023-09-09

1,Not good,2023-05-04
3,"Decent for online shopping, although needs some work. Went to Ikea yesterday and downloaded the app to assist with shopping and it did not match the same search results as the store terminals.

1,"Updated review 2023-10-11: The app is no longer functional for me. Previously it would warn me that they don't recommend running the app on a rooted device, which is fine; I could still dismiss it and use the app. Now, when I dismiss that warning, it just comes up again instantly, and never lets me use the app. I'm not going to un-root my phone just to use this app.",2023-10-11

1,I don't get it why I'm a customer Ikea in Romania but I can't use the app because Romania is not listed so I can't login or anything else?! What's the problem? Is ikea from Romania a different Ikea or the devs. forgot to update the app?,2020-12-29
4,"I really like the app. I love the shopping basket and wish list options, my only criticism is that an item will be displayed as available for delivery but when you proceed to check out it will be listed as unavailable for delivery even though the item will still be available in the app.",2020-11-10

1,"Return service pathethic So if you want to cancel a single product from delivery order they just DON'T do it. My order was NOT DISPATCHED still they DON'T do it. So let the product come at your place and then place a return request. This is what Ikea prefers. Sent an email for return, the CS is so pathetic now they asking for article no. If you already have an order number, we have clearly mentioned the product which we want to return, ready to pay return charges BUT they want article no.",2021-12-18

5,Love ikea so am excited that I can create my personal wishlist before purchase.,2020-11-02
1,"Overall IKEA experience has been an absolute piece of garbage lately. The crucial component of hardware is still missing in stock some weeks after the date they've promised it should arrive in stock, the order got delivered to a wrong address, and now there's apparently no way to cancel it and re-order because the chat in the app is unresponsive, the operator mever comes, and I can't even get through on the hotline. And basically all of my friends have been experiencing the same issues lately.",2021-09-20

2,"Still full of bugs that need attention. App failing to let you check out at local store, insists on delivery about 250 miles away. Won't let you see past purchases for receipts. It was fine for a while but back to behaving badly.",2023-04-10

5,Very enjoyable see their products!,2022-10-06
5,Wonderful I just got an order done with the Click and collect. It was so easy. Thanks!,2022-04-11
1,"Appalling. Kept freezing when it came to pay x 4. Eventually went through and asked me to verify via my banking app. Did that and it threw me out for inactivity- 30 seconds whilst I was confirming the purchase. ""Don't worry"" though because my basket was saved. Yeah no thanks ikea it's too frustrating to put in my details another time.",2023-02-08
1,Very much disappointed with delivery time. I have ordered more than 20 days and still not get my parcel. Also dial customer care number 15-20 times it's busy. No reply/response by IKEA team. I have order more than 15 items worth 4990/-. Highly disappointed with IKEA .,2023-08-03

5,Nice,2022-06-22
1,This is a poor app. It will not work with Opera and when I switched to Chrome and signed in with code since forgot password the damn site would not let me change the bloody password. Clicked on customer link for support then got the 404 error....useless!,2022-06-10
4,"Overall helpful and good for reference while shopping in person. The delivery and pickup options are frustrating and the inaccuracy of the stock levels makes it hard to trust before heading to the store. Also, items that I know are displayed in store are not even listed on the app. Even when items were available to ship, half my order was cancelled after the fact. Not sure if the app is to blame for that or if it's an infrastructure/supply issue.",2022-02-03

2,The app used to have a better layout and features. My biggest issue is that I moved to another country and if I switch to see the inventories for that region it is only available in that native language. Being in this part of the world where so many travel from different parts of the world you would think that would be an easy option for them to implement.,2023-11-16

3,"OK, but... Setting up accounts requires going around in circles... it doesn't store where you are up to after reading T&Cs. It doesn't guide you through the store to find the item... the main thing I wanted it to do (like Bunnings app does). It did help me locate an item on the racks, luckily, because the ticket info in the display area was wrong abt where the item was. Hope it gets developed to be much tidier in its operation.",2022-02-12

1,still asks me to install google chrome.. :\ no thank you!,2022-11-18
2,"Over-engineered app that makes it harder to find the things you already know you want. I already have Kallax storage, so want another. As the Swedish names mean v little to me a customer, I searched storage and bookcase and it never came up. I spent 30mins going through lots of wrong items and as there are so many options/ colours, you can't quickly do a broad search of all. We need pictures, not names in the menu choices!",2020-01-24
5,Funkcionalno,2022-08-06
5,"Excellent way to shop the store without the annoying one-way system. Creating as many shopping lists as you want helps narrow down room choices and helps decide on the bigger purchases. Also really helpful when finding your items in the warehouse of your chosen store. Really really helpful when you can't find what you want but is available in another store. The home delivery service is good, but could be better as some favourite items of mine aren't available for home delivery.",2023-07-29

1,"Horrible new app: thinks I'm in a different city and won't let me change, very difficult to find what you're looking for, deleted my list, and I can't see what's in stock in my store or where to find it, which makes life difficult as I live three hours away and don't want to drive in on the ""hope"" that they've got what I need. Deeply dissatisfied with this app and would like to go back to previous one",2020-06-20
2,"Frustrating and slow to navigate. Finding your orders pending delivery is not as obvious as it should be, you can't click links to items listed on your order history. The specific color / type of item you purchased is not displayed in-case you need to buy something such as more drawers for a bed that comes in ""light gray"" and ""vissle gray"". Loading times in general are rather slow for everything. Sometimes it says I can't get delivery until I reload the app.",2022-07-29

1,"It feels like IKEA management pushed this new app without listening to any end users.

1,"LOVE IKEA, HATE THIS APP It says an item is in stock, yet when I go to check out, items are suddenly taken away. For the items that remain in the basket, it says delivery is not available & that I can't click & collect. I put in my postcode, it says they can't deliver to me in Norwich...I live no where near Norwich! Due to covid, I have avoided the queues at the store, but what good is it when the app (and desktop site) consistently throw up unwarranted errors?",2021-07-13
4,It's very close to a great app but needs some work on the customer journeys. E.g. some parts for a wardrobe are out of stock in store...ok but why hide details of which parts are in stock? Let me decide if I want to pickup most of the bits and e.g. order a hanging rail/door to be delivered by post. Also look into caching more of the data (aisle locations) when adding to basket for when offline in the warehouse - signal isn't great there.,2022-10-27

3,The app is great. But for what reason do you lock language per country?? In Finland for example you can only choose Finnish. Even though Swedish is a official language and i know for a fact you have already everything in swedish... and while you are at it why not let all foreigners in the world choose english also if you can not separate the country from the language as I'm quite certain english is the base language of the app...

1,"Painful. Bed gives dimensions of the mattress you need but doesn't bother to give the dimensions of the bed itself! Creating a password is like a stupid game. It rejects for dozens of reasons but nowhere does it tell you what you need to have. Just stupid, piecemeal, rejections.",2022-06-24
1,"This app is even more useless that the IKEA website. I was hoping there might be a PAX planner as the website sends you to a dead end.

4,4 star because It's good app. but the big problem is when you travel to the other country there is no way to change the language . Please fix it Thanks,2022-03-17
3,Works nicely but doesn't allow you to do what you wanted. Was forced to go on here to do a design layout for the kitchen. But I'm not able to add the items or cabinets I wanted. There used to be a way to design a room how you like. Very unfortunate because it would be a great way to give purchase from the website from just designing alone.,2023-07-29

5,Amazing app,2020-05-02
1,Easily the lousiest and most user unfriendly app from a big brand. Browsing is slow as it was in 1990s. Order shows delivered while on transit. Customer says you have to track on website by 'entering' order no. Worst part is for my 2nd order it does not remember and show the previous address. Really? Worst biggest furniture brand has such an app?,2022-02-04
4,"Good but could be better. Ordering is really easy and straight forward. Amending at the checkout is not intuitive at all, it is really stressful as the stock levels change or you can not click and collect for the store you choose.

4,I just installed the app and what makes it difficult to use is that you can't choose the language - it automatically matches the country you are at. The problem is that I am an expat in an Eastern European country and don't speak the local language. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,2022-10-08

4,EDIT: It was because my app was not updated to the latest version.

1,"Suffers from a range of technical issues, website has issue with traffic and errors are unhelpful. It will not tell you items are out of stock/unavailable for delivery (it will in fact say in stock), it instead starts taking items out you cart at the checkout. It will also swap between refusing my postcode for deliveries and allowing it. Finally falls down on some of the most simple UX/UI rules.

The customer care is pathetic too. They either disconnect your call, after hours of waiting in queue or will promise you a false callback within 24 -72 hours. The items from my order are missing.

Other than that, I placed a $3,000 c and c order via the app. It told me what wasn't available for C and C when I was at the check out. I understand when stock is low, IKEA does not allow C and C purchase. That makes sense. Nice job. Big gains in online shopping in the past year.

1,"Unusable for me at the moment, I'll stick to the website. I cannot login to the app because I do not use Google's Chrome browser. An app shouldn't depend on a specific browser. Haven't we learned from MS Internet Explorer? Or from the old pax planners based on flash? And on a sidenote: why show a warning to root users? It's non of your business if the app user can obtain root privileges or not.",2021-11-10

3,I am not happy about this app that replaced the other one. It lacks both search and browsing options that I really enjoyed to get inspirations,2020-06-20
2,Makes shopping in store more difficult since you have to use the mobile website to see location information,2021-05-28

1,"Eventhough I have the app, everytime I want to get in it opens the web to log in instead of the app. Once I'm in it doesn't load the preferred store so I can't see if the items are available in my store. And it doesn't tell me if the items are available or not until the very end when it tells me that I have to delete the items to continue because they are not available. It uses to be a really good app, but not anymore. Shame!",2020-08-23
5,Great App! Can't fault it,2023-11-03
2,"A little harder to use than the website, nothing crazy though, manageable. The real reason they lose stars is because they pretend like things aren't in stock in order to make you pay more for delivery, or pretend things aren't available for delivery until you purchase them separately and they can charge you two delivery fees!",2022-06-25

4,"One of the best app to buy Kitchen & home essentials including furnitures. Attractive designs & innovative products at affordable prices. But the worst thing is refund policy. They says it takes around 2 weeks even if it was due to some technical issues in the app. I'm waiting for refund from last 12 days.

5,"A masterclass in app design, UX has clearly been given front and centre attention when the UI was being drawn up and it shows in how easy to move around it is. Almost anything you need to do in-store or out is possible using the app and with the new scan functionality in-app, it really is the icing on the proverbial cake. If more apps were given this level of consideration and thought in their design and operation, we'd be living the life.",2023-05-19

1,Would have hoped that the app would be more user friendly than the website. Very disappointed to find that items added to my basket in the app seem to have disappeared in the space of a week.

1,"Oh dear. Such a poor attempt. Design is nice, but that's where the positivity stops. The search function is dire, bringing up so many irrelevant results. This may not be so much of an issue if the filter option was half decent but it's just awful, with NO useful filters to narrow down the results. The results you get are pretty hard to locate the item you want. Example: Hemnes bed brings up multiple results with the same title, but with different pricing and no further info as to why. Just no.",2020-02-07

Not liking it forces us into categories we don't want much like their store layout which forces us to tour the whole store as if reading a catalog like a book - from end to end. They should include shuttle bus information. I have no car so I arrive by transit. I'm hoping their newest DT location won't be setup so asinine as their storybook concept for their suburb stores. 5G service + 8Gb RAM and its still slow to load.,2022-05-23

4,"The new app is significant leap from the previous one. However, when you search for a product, the inspiration images that pop do not have other products linked in. This could lead to shop other unrelated products in these images rather having to find them. The app also doesn't seem to be connected to the offers going on in the stores or launch of new range/ items",2021-01-25

1,Bad app,2023-06-22
1,"It is amazing that Ikea, the company with the world's best design and merchandise can have such an abysmally bad website. The whole online experience on your site is frustration and disappointment! I could list scores of omissions,inconveniences, etc. But, let me just recommend spending a few minutes on Amazon to get some ideas...on your deficiencies, lost sales and just outright missing the boat.

1,This is the worst ever company to buy home furnishing products. People working in IKEA thinks they are the owner of store they mistreat customer. All products are below standards. They will make you run like anything once you bought anything big and want to return if product is not upto the mark. Don't buy anything from here any local furniture store is better than them,2023-06-16

3,It's ok but the store app was better. This one doesn't tell us the possible in stock date for out of stock items. I wish there was a margin of error number for in stock items or a way to report stores for not stocking the floor with the 30 some odd items listed as being in stock for a whole week or two but the floor is oddly bare. Which is even odder when the floor people tell you they restock the floor daily.,2021-01-11

3,"Good for browsing, but useless for shopping. There is no way to filter out unavailable items, and every time I checkout it errors out claiming some items can't be delivered, without telling me which. The website doesn't have this problem, so I add to wishlist here, then checkout from the website. Wishlist, not cart, because oddly enough the website has no cart and does a checkout from the wishlist.",2022-02-12
