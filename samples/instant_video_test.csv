5.0,I really enjoyed Alpha House. I found the Senators hilarious. John Goodman makes the show &#34;ring&#34;. I'm looking forward to more episodes in the future. The John Goodman character has to be re-elected!!,1388707200,2014-01-03
3.0,"This series is turning out to be much like the old Ally McBeal series.  The acting and writing both appear to become more overdone as the series progresses.  Everyone is a tad too attractive to be believed and the performances, particularly by the two principal players, are so hammy and emotive that it takes away from the story lines, even on the rare occasions when they are believable.  Even competent experienced performers like Gary Cole who is a frequent guest star this year, turn in overwrought performances that make their characters seem like cartoons.",1400716800,2014-05-22
5.0,It is a real shame this well written and acted series is not going to continue after season five.  An adult show that doesn't insult your intelligence.,1394064000,2014-03-06
5.0,I am hooked right away!  This is in the same vain as 24!  Need to see how they develop the story line more!  Not to brutal yet!  I would not recommend this for people below the age of 16.,1395705600,2014-03-25
5.0,"The shield is a gritty, needle in the eye kind of series. You find yourself rooting for a bad cop who thinks it his God given right to mead out justice ghetto street style!",1371686400,2013-06-20
5.0,"When I was a young man running my first rig in the Oil Fields in Kern county California, was having trouble with doing jobs faster than the other crews I worked with. One day the man who trained me pulled me aside and said ""You don't get it... They don't want good operators, they want good liars"".In this wonderfully written and acted series, Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard test that theory, in the world of the upper class, by ""stealing the American dream"".  This series brings the public to a mostly unknown hidden culture in America of the Travelers (Irish Gypsies) which is something cool in a TV show, going so far out of the box of regular TV writing it's in another warehouse.If you want something very different, ""The Riches"" is a show for you.",1200009600,2008-01-11
5.0,"Great plots. But the final cut usually shows their emotions too much. That is unrealistic in real life spy stuff. Nobody can have a real relationship. They always portray a relationship like this. &#34;I love you and I will go to the ends of the earth for you.&#34; &#34;OK, lets go to the end of the earth.&#34; &#34;Uh. . .Let me think about it.&#34;",1389225600,2014-01-09
5.0,"This is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. Season 3 continues to impress with its top notch acting, great special effects, and fascinating story lines. In my opinion, the best character is Mr. Gold aka Rumpelstiltskin.",1391385600,2014-02-03
4.0,"I wasn't expecting to like another football TV show, but this is solid & doesn't have the same tone or characters as Friday Night Lights.  I like this one better.  Some of the characters are a bit cliche, but it seems like a feel good type of show overall.",1392163200,2014-02-12
5.0,"Hilarious, well thought out, tons of laughs and word play..........It's Archer. What more do I need to say? Start from season 1 and watch it through season 3.",1338595200,2012-06-02
4.0,"Well written and macabre, if a bit predictable. Fans of the movie series will enjoy it however it does change the Hannibal character a bit. It is somewhat formulaic in its presentation but does make up for that with good writing and acting.",1393459200,2014-02-27
5.0,Wow folks this season will blow you away .I knew I had to have it but this was the most action filled season yet.buy buy buy I can't stress enough if you are a fan you will love it if not you will be one!,1386806400,2013-12-12
5.0,Cal Lightman is an enigma sometimes you love him sometimes you hate him but the character is certainly unique and the way he and Jillian interact is great.  Went thru all 3 seasons in a week and wish there were more.,1397779200,2014-04-18
4.0,will continue to watch it and find out it its worth watching . like it so far. found it by accident.,1397174400,2014-04-11
5.0,"Well acted, really engaging and interesting storyline. Lots of twists and turns and situations that just blow you away. Highly recommended",1394582400,2014-03-12
3.0,"This is an OK action-adventure show with Eric Dane appropriately clench-jawed as the ship's captain and Rhona Mitra as the world's most glamorous virologist, the last hope against a world-wide pandemic.  If you can buy that premise you're good to go.  SPOILERS FOLLOW:  Sam Spruell appears as a Rooski spy so creepy that he might as well wear a sign reading ""plot device"".  Couple of caveats: first thing I noticed is that except for a coincidence of names and the fact that most of the action occurs on a US Navy warship this has no connection with the William Brinkley novel.  Second, there are a bunch of plot-required things that make no particular sense.  Example: EMCON (emissions control) as used here means no signals from the vessel (secret mission and all).  They could still watch TV, listen to NPR or whatever including the news.  At exactly the right moment in the first episode a guy pops up out of nowhere with what looks like an AT-4 (rocket launcher) to save the day.  If things like that don't bother you or you enjoy nitpicking you'll probably enjoy the show.  BTW: the thing that impressed me most is that when the ship got to GTMO the establishing shots actually looked like GTMO.  Good going guys.",1404604800,2014-07-06
5.0,I love the actors and the drama that gets more involved after watching each show.  The Season 2 is really great police drama that draws you in and won't let you go.  The many street characters are believable and scary.  This is how the streets in many city's are.  Living in a cop family...you know the stories are real.,1363737600,2013-03-20
4.0,Had never watched this series before and didn't know it even was on line until Amazon Prime -- very good series -- well worth the time and watching,1399593600,2014-05-09
4.0,This special had it's high points and it's low points but Matt Smith was amazing all the way through. Not to mention the fantastic Ian McKellen added his amazing voice to yet another sci-fi franchise. Defiantly worth a watch for fans new and old.,1367193600,2013-04-29
4.0,"This is cult film stuff, just the kind I like to watch.  Sometimes called &#34;Kafka-esque&#34;  movies like Doubles can appeal in the way that other film classics that are tagged with &#34;Fellini-esque,&#34; etc. will catch the eye of certain movie-mavens.  It reminded me in terms of a dystopian setting to &#34;Brazil&#34; of a few decades ago.  Not quite the same humor, Doubles has some dire scenes, but Jesse Eisenberg does a very admirable job of playing two different roles simultaneously.  It's not &#34;Spiderman,&#34; but you knew that already.When browsing the evening's offerings, Doubles caught my eye, because earlier in the day, I just caught the tail end of an excellent NPR review of the movie that was very favorable.  On that brief moment alone, I knew I would look forward to seeing Doubles, so when it appeared on Amazon's lineup, I went for it immediately.  I was not disappointed.",1399852800,2014-05-12
3.0,"It seems like in addition to the nudity, F-bombs, and the apocalyptic bent, the supernatural(?) is thrown in&#8230;It reminds me of a mixture of Lost, Revolution, and The Twilight Zone. Can we get a drama that does not have the first two? There have been shows on for years (here's looking at YOU, Chris Carter) that had compelling stories without the unnecessary use of profanity or nudity. If the story calls for these items to move the story along is one thing, but it just seems tacked on for ratings sake, and it is not needed, in fact, it detracts and distracts. It is almost like the dictionary had been thrown away in favor of a few curse words that just have to be used about every other word. If the show was re-edited without the language, it would be a more coherent, taut story. I don't see anything like this among this crop of pilots, Amazon...",1391904000,2014-02-09
5.0,Great series. Police work with some twists and a lot of humor. I have really enjoyed this season and am looking forward to more.,1374710400,2013-07-25
5.0,"I don't know about you, but figuring out the plot of a show in the first 10 minutes or the direction of a season early gets very tiresome. Formula TV has become the norm, now in recent years we have been blessed with those exceptions like madmen, walking dead, house of cards, Breaking bad, et al. Rubicon somehow got buy me, and this show wouldn't be popular among most Americans because you have to invest some time in the first couple of episodes in character development, background, and general housekeeping. However, if you are willing to lend the director those couple of hours, in return you will receive some of the most Clancy like drama I have seen outside the pages of his books. Rubicon is one of those shows that I won't thickly forget. Even more exciting amazon has shown me more previously unknown shows I might like if I liked Rubicon. So enjoy.",1394064000,2014-03-06
5.0,"I just started watching this show & think it's pretty good. There is a lot of violence, bad language, etc..., so it's not for everyone. But if you enjoy watching bikers ride & fight, you'll probably like it.",1383696000,2013-11-06
5.0,I loved season one of Continuum and find I like this year even better.  The characters are likable ( hateful if they are the bad guys),1371686400,2013-06-20
5.0,"IT is a new concept in law enforcement,a  casual ,laidback ,great looking guy,smart ,and refuses to wear a uniform, instead wears jeans ,t-shirts and tennis shoes..but in a very small  police department on the Florida east coast,he solves crimes with all the talents he learned back in Chicago as a high profile police detective...I love his co talented actors on the show..this is a awesome twist on the cops and robbers,style show..",1394928000,2014-03-16

5.0,We bought this copy of SOA as a gift for someone. We are totally hooked on this show and can't wait for the next season to come out!,1310688000,2011-07-15
5.0,"I watched the whole season in a week!  Couldn't stop.  It's amazing.  The whole story line is unique.  I can't believe I was rooting for Russian spies, but the show is THAT good!",1392854400,2014-02-20
5.0,"Major Crimes takes a different tack in how to approach police work.  Where Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson in The Closerwas the driving force,  Captain Raydor stands back and let's her team work the job.  She IS the finisher and the facilitator.  She quietly views the possibilities.  I am thoroughly enjoying seeing the past Closer team taking leadership roles.  Provenza is a hoot, but also a savvy police officer.  The entire team have stronger roles, so you get to know them better.  I loved the episode with Tau and his son--the officer who is so grounded in the technical shows his father's love.  Sanchez shows more humor;  Flynn takes a more active role and shows his very human side;  Buzz steps up and becomes more involved.  Bringing in a female officer was another very good way to go.  The dynamics are changed.  Rusty, the Stroh witness, and his relationship with Capt. Raydor is powerful.  Capt. Raydor now becomes a woman who is concerned about the &#34;child&#34; in her custody.  Agent Howard returned in an episode.  I liked that.  I watched and have every Season of The Closer.  I now have every episode of Major Crimes.",1389398400,2014-01-11
5.0,"'Blackout' is what I would call a tense, character driven, political 'Neo Noir Thriller' series from BBC. Christopher Eccleston effortlessly plunges himself into the role of an abject alcoholic who still just does manage on as a respected councilman. He has many flaws - prostitutes, drinking, and work fraud to name a few - but his fatal flaw, which we don't ever really get any kind of clinical read on, is one of self-hatred. Never-the-less, with his one sober-fueled but brain-numbed act of gravitas, our sad protagonist changes direction and begins a very interesting, yet fraught-filled course.The premise of this series is quite interesting. There are those who are evil and we know it, and there are kinds of evil operating behind the scenes, so-to-speak, that keep us off balance.Eccleston handles himself very well as the lead, Daniel Demoys. In fact, this was my first opportunity to see him in a lead role and I was very impressed. Demoys' wife (Alex), Dervla Kirwan, is also a heavy hitter in this series. She more than carries her role, as usual. The busy actor, Ewan Bremner(Jerry Durrans), brings intensity and drama with his deep set, closely paired eyes sitting atop that hawk-like nose, drilling his opponents down with however much authority he wishes to personify.As an aside, the Producers/Directors have dealt very well with inserting the cycle of alcoholism and family dynamics into the series. That is something of which we do not see enough.'Blackout' ends in such a way that can be considered resolved or, hopefully BBC will consider following the lives and crimes of those we are left wondering about. So many loose ends or further mysterious trails to ponder...?",1353715200,2012-11-24
1.0,"This series is awful. If you like looking at very faint dots of refracted light taken in photo, or Blankets that were obviously tied to a string in a manner to move them then you might like it. Everyone claims to see a ghost, but their footage is so poor that a ton of other explanations could account for what is presented. Like Bigfoot and UFO's... When real concrete, scientific and fully documented proof is discovered then all this is just non-sense.",1405209600,2014-07-13
4.0,"This season was very intriguing.  It revolved around the death of Henry Wilcox's son and his revenge against the agency.  The entire division of the CIA was shaken up and exploited.  Annie and Augies relationship endured many obstacles as the plot thickened and moved from country to country.If you like intrigue and undercover plots, you'll love this show.",1403740800,2014-06-26
5.0,"Avatar The Last Airbender was an amazing and critically acclaimed series, and the Legends of Korra, it's sequel, has big boots to fill.  Fortunately Korra is up to the task.This series keeps the basic setting of the Avatar series, and fans of the original will quickly adapt.  However, Korra has a vastly different tone and feel to it, enough to set itself apart without alienating the existing fan base.  It is not an easy task to accomplish, but the writers and producers have managed it perfectly here.Where Airbender was set in a very mystical East Asian type setting, Korra has a very steampunk feel.  Technology begins making an appearance, and even the dress and mannerisms of the characters reflect this change.  At the same time, the setting of the original series, completely with spirits and mysticism, remains intact.Overall Korra has a much darker tone to it than Airbender did.  Enemies are scarier, situations are more tense, and you actually fear for the characters.  It is a logical progression assuming that the age group that airbender targeted has aged since the premier of the original series.  The show is still perfectly fine for kids,  but teenagers and adults will find more drama and tension than before.  Arguments and politics are never presented with a winning or losing side, always leaving the decision of who is right or wrong up the viewer.Overall this is one of the best and smartest shows on television right now, enjoyable for people of all ages, and I highly recommend it to fans of the original series and newcomers alike.",1387238400,2013-12-17
5.0,"This is another amazing TV series that keeps you interested from the beginning of each season to the end. I love the story plots and how each of the three main characters are affected...wow, a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost! Very well made with great performances from the cast.",1362182400,2013-03-02
5.0,"This is a neat cartoon that teaches kids to read. Good stories and twists on the classics, would recommend this series for preschoolers",1391817600,2014-02-08
4.0,So far it is ok. I was hoping for more of Raylan action. The other seasons seemed better. But it may perk up. I think viewers like to see more of Raylan and his older ways. At least I do.  :o),1389657600,2014-01-14
5.0,This is a docudrama about Henry the Eighth. There is a lot of action and beautiful people to keep you watching.I would not recommend this for children.Dr George Tomes,1391644800,2014-02-06
4.0,"This is not a perfect film. However, it is a very good one about adults so it is a huge step ahead right there. The extremely gifted Marcia Gay Harden plays a middle aged wife who comes upon her husband having an affair with a much younger woman. Whenever Harden is on camera, the film shines. Less so with the other actors. Although Aidan Quinn as a late stage romance interest is quite believable and attractive.The husband and the mistress do not know Harden knows about them. She starts playing them one against the other although she starts to like the woman. The husband becomes less likable every moment the film goes on and he starts pretty close to the bottom. The mistress is pretty good but it is her interaction with Harden which works. Her scenes with other actors don't work nearly as well.The most inspired part of the film is that both women become part of a theater troup for putting on King Lear. Harden gets the lead as a modern day female CEO Lear. The mistress plays her Fool. You quickly discover that Shakespeare is well within Harden's range as she is great as a female Lear.I found this a very good night's entertainment and saw it on Netflix streaming.",1402272000,2014-06-09
3.0,"I badly want to give this 4-5 stars, but just cannot bring myself to do it. That's certainly not Olyphant's fault. He is in rare form as Raylan Givens while the hair-trigger Deputy U.S. Marshal starts to slip more toward the dark side.At first I thought it was somewhat fun that the writers decided to bring in the Crowe family from Florida. It turned out to be a terrible mistake. The chemistry just wasn't there, and despite being more physical and brutal, even the smartest of them is only marginally more intelligent than the comic relief character Dewey.The Ava Crowder story line is long, tedious, excessively trite, and entirely without point.One scene that was built up as an epic encounter just waiting to be played out turned out to be an exercise in laughable stupidity.The writers, much like this review, were simply all over the map. Thankfully, they brought the story to a very definitive point with the conclusion, setting up what is supposed to be the epic final season where Givens will finally get to face off against his nemesis.",1402185600,2014-06-08
5.0,"I have really enjoyed this series so far. I love Emily's character. She has got such a fun personality and one that many can relate to, especially when she tries to make everyone happy but finds that sometimes that doesn't work. I have also enjoyed that cast in this series.",1353801600,2012-11-25

5.0,"I avoided this show because of the cover, assuming it would be full of racy scenes but someone recommended it so I decided to give it a try. Now my wife and I both really enjoy the show. There is little bad language, few sexually overt scenes and provocative apparel is seldom seen and has no influence in the show itself. The stories are well done and interesting and the acting is excellent.",1373328000,2013-07-09
5.0,"24 is the most  fun series I have ever seen on tv.  I love keifer Sutherland and it appears to me that a lot of actors get good parts and get in a lot of acting.  Also this series has people, even the bad guys speaking articulately and very rationally.  We are seeing a show full of admirable people not a bunch of losers.  That must be a part of the popularity of the series.Note something else, these people comply with the human requirement  of pronouncing judgement.",1398211200,2014-04-23

5.0,"The plot is great, unpredictable. No one is safe. You start to love the characters and then things happen and you end up upset. I don't think this is going to have a happy ending. But I'm just glad that it doesn't try to please the audience, instead, the audience are forced to accept the events and move on, which pretty much what the show is all about. Brilliant show.",1391990400,2014-02-10

5.0,"Fargo was an excellent series and more than lived up to the movie that it is based on.  Everything about the series was awesome and the acting quality was on par with such shows like Game of Thrones, Turn, and The Walking Dead, just to name a few.  Since the details of the blu-ray have not been released yet, this is a review of the series only, but when I receive my copy I will update my review.  If you haven't seen it yet and you liked the classic film of the same name, then you will love the series.",1402963200,2014-06-17
5.0,"I am a deadwood fan, So Timothy Olyphant playing a US marshal is a no brainer. He was excellent as Seth bullock, And just as good as Raylon.

5.0,"I can not believe that AMC didn't let this series have a second season.  It was one of the best shows television has to offer and ranks right up there with some of the British spy shows that excel far above our own.  It was a spectacular adventure full of excitement that kept you on the edge of your seat. I loved each one of the actors in their roles. The story is about Analysis done by a group of people who are able to ""connect the dots"" to protect the USA from foreign and domestic enemies willing to destroy our way of life.  It's a shame Showtime doesn't pick this up, because they would at least promote the series.  I didn't even realize it was on television until the first and final season ended.",1379721600,2013-09-21

If you're tired of shoot'm ups and want to watch something that is intelligently written about a world most of us know little to nothing about (high brow Manhattan lawyer world), give it a try. The teaming of high stakes law, Gabriel Macht, with college drop out naive genius, Patrick Adams, works very well -- with mostly feel good endings. Fun show.",1376006400,2013-08-09
5.0,"The show was a little slow starting the season off,but by the end really had me hooked.  I can't wait to see what happens in the next season.  This Green Arrow is far different than what was portrayed in Smallville, which is a good thing.  I did like the Smallville version, but this is its own show making its own path, and if the audience and network give it a chance, I can see a long running of the series.  So far, the villains are regular villains, not superpowered for the most part (although there are some highly skilled opponents of course).  I know very little about the comic book version so I don't know how long time fans of his will feel, but I definitely recommend this show.",1374883200,2013-07-27
5.0,"As my review title goes, this was a great show.  Originally I thought it would be a comedy, but it's more of a drama with a lot of irony.  Not your typical formula show, which is why it was so cool but also probably why it got cancelled.  Very disappointed that they cancelled it halfway through the season (can anyone say &#34;Firefly&#34;?) with so many loose threads that will never be tied off.",1399852800,2014-05-12

4.0,"We knew it was coming one of these days. I think they did a good and appropriate job of ending the series. If you remember episode 1, you can guess what the last scene will be. I will miss the characters of Eureka, but I thought this was a good curtain call.",1371686400,2013-06-20

5.0,"There have been Onion News TV Shows before, and they've been great. But the decision to give the show an actual plot instead of simply having a fake news broadcast made me a bit weary. Turns out it totally works though. This means they can not only spoof the news, but also use an overarching plot to spoof shows like 'The Newsroom.' It's typical Onion humor in the sense that it's manages to straddle the line between events that are part totally outlandish and part sadly possible. Really hope to see more of Onion News Empire.",1366502400,2013-04-21
2.0,"I hope that people enjoy the TV series that did not read the book.  I suspect others who have read the book are gravely disappointed.  Spoilers will appear in this description.  It seems that everyone in town are less than 30 years old other than Big Jim and a few of his cohorts.  The age curve is so skewed that it doesn't allow the sense of town to be depicted.  It feels fake.  In order to believe, you just can't have too many FAKE arguments.  Big Jim's looney son was an excellent demented character in the book but in the TV series he is just a half wit.  Barbie's character in the book was believable.  Again maybe those who did not go read the book first might find his character acceptable but viewed from the books perspective he just doesn't have the true strength of character necessitated for this story.  The red-haired &#34;reporter&#34; walks, walks and walks through her role that really should have been charged full of energy.

3.0,"This is a children's show with a purpose. It takes the mystery kid genre a bit more seriously than shows like &#34;Blue's Clues&#34;, but not so serious that a child wouldn't enjoy it. It is more focused due to the fact that they are providing educational opportunities throughout the mystery that are more needed than some other shows of the genre do. In the pilot they used simple math to teach children about a pattern. It was genius! This is what a children's show should be about, providing educational opportunities while not making your child feel bad about not knowing what is going on all the time in the context of the show. I would have any child watch this.",1367020800,2013-04-27

2.0,"I was trying to figure out why I don't engage with this show - I enjoyed (some of) Tim Cring's Heroes series and Touch follows a similar theme of extraordinary results from an everyday hero. I also liked the pilot but by the fourth episode had completely lost interest. I'll also confess that I'm not a fan of the 'network narrative' genre where Hollywood can manufacture a story line based upon on the coincidental eventual meeting point of a handful of strangers.I think there are a couple of problems. The first is the mathematical theme - it just doesn't make sense to extrapolate a Math 101 understanding of the Fibbonaci sequence and the Butterfly Effect to give a mute child near psychic powers to predict where the lives of a random bunch of strangers will meet. It comes across as really manipulative and far-fetched. The second is that Keifer has little to do other than act like Lassie's owner, trying to make sense of cryptic messages from a child that won't speak, while filling the dialog gap with cries of ""Jake! Jake! Jake!"" every other scene.So Touch is a sentimental show more along the lines of Highway to Heaven (whoa, dig out the history books) than anything particularly scientific as it pretends to be. And after four episodes the plot didn't move forward enough to really capture my attention.",1365465600,2013-04-09

In my mind, it comes close, but misses a bull's eye by &#34;that much&#34; &#60;pinched fingers&#62;. There is plenty of action and miraculous stuff to lead us on to a 'what if' conclusion, but somehow it isn't as satisfying as it should be.

3.0,"The acting and production, other than Charlie Hunam's fake American accent are excellent.  The characters are despicable, almost down to the last one, and if they had all been wiped out at the end, I would have cheered.  Unfortunately, two of the few who were closest to real-life and deserved empathy went at the end.  I loved the last scene (Spoiler?) with Jax wailing...it should have been the end of the series.  Sutter either needs to come up with a real plot-line, or simply whack everybody after a very short final season.I wasn't going to watch it at all, but my receptionist bought it for me, so I promised her I would.  With true masterpieces like Breaking Bad and Dexter ending this year, there are few really good series left.  Justified, Hell on Wheels, and even The Walking Dead far outshine SOA.As I say, for the drama and production, it's watchable.  For the idiotic, never-ending, mooney songs with flash-backs melodramatically sifting through, and the collateral violence that makes you wonder how if it were real-life, how many cretinesque gangsters could be left on the planet...not to mention how many walk unscathed through one hail of gunfire after another???  Sheesh!  There are times when a Roadrunner cartoon seems more realistic.Since there will apparently be yet one more season, maybe they'll start dropping &#34;Acme anvils&#34; on the characters?",1387843200,2013-12-24

4.0,"Jonathan Ames, a writer of eccentric novels, penned the book on which this bizarre film is based.  His story of confused identities and searching for a workable concept of self was adapted for the screen by Ames with help from co-directors Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman.  It is a confusing tale to watch but has moments of comedic insight and a cat of well-known actors that help to make the film entertaining - if a bit of fluff.We meet English teacher Louis Ives (Paul Dano) after a prelude of daydreaming the three factors that characterize Louis  - his obsession with  classic literature of the 1920s, his untrained perception of how to relate to people (`awkward' would be a kind term), and his penchant for fantasizing about cross dressing. He is dismissed from his school `due to budget cuts' (read `having been discovered trying on a bra and being caught by the headmaster'), yet his inappropriate response is one of glee at having been given the opportunity to move to Manhattan to become a writer.Once in New York City without connections, he answers an ad for an inexpensive apartment sharing - the ad having been submitted by one very strange Henry Harrison (Kevin Kline), an older down on his heels writer and playwright who supports himself teaching college level literature and who considers himself an aristocrat, serving as an `escort' for older wealthy women.  After an uncomfortable interview Henry consents to allow Louis to be his roommate: after weighing his options Louis accepts the room in the flea infested filthy apartment and begins trying to get to know the secretive and zany Henry.Henry provides companionship for one Vivian (Marion Seldes) and eventually Louis is brought in as an `extra man' to provide companionship for one of Vivian's friends (Celia Watson).  In the meantime Louis finds work as a telephone salesman for a Green magazine, meets the pretty but unavailable Mary (Katie Holmes), begins to encounter Henry's entourage of loonies such as Henry's bearded and dirty repairman Gershon (John C. Reilly), and gives in to his urge to learn about cross-dressing by visiting a `teacher ` and finally a make-over artist who places him in the role of a `woman'.  Louis' experience with transvestism fails and alienates Henry - for a brief time.  But what this comedic episode results in is Louis' discovery of what is important - friends and family - and Henry and his entourage supply that and the changes this brings in all the characters draws the film to a close.With a cast such as this we find ourselves wanting to connect with each character - bizarre though they all are - and to a degree this occurs.  But the script is spotty and the direction is bumpy and in many ways it feels as though the film simply never gets off the ground.  Good moments: no after taste to savor.

4.0,"Special Features: ""The Devil's Roadmap"", ""Webisodes"", three commentary tracks, gag reel, deleted/unaired scenesThere was no witchcraft involved in the success of ""Supernatural"". The show benefited from top notch writing, direction and performances with just the right dash of quirky humor to offset the horror elements of the show. The second season of the show picks up right where the first ended. Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) have located their dad  (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and have the fabled gun fashioned to kill demons in their possession. The trio confront the Demon that killed Dean and Sam's mom only to find it leaping from person to person finally possessing their father almost forcing the boys to kill him. Driving the Demon out of their father the trio escape with the gun believing that they can still track down the creature, find out why it has harvested children with special psychic abilities and how it plans on using them in its ""war"" against humanity. Then a truck hits Dean's 1967 Impala. Sam is injured but alive and Dean is on the cusp of death with internal injuries. John makes a deal with the Devil or, in this case, the Demon they were pursuing--take his life for Dean's. Before he dies John whispers something to Dean which will resonate throughout the rest of the second season.We get three commentary tracks on ""In My Time of Dying"" (director Kim Manners and actors Ackles & Padalecki), ""What Is And Should Never Be"" (writer Eric Kripe) and the first part of the season two finale ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" (Kripke, Manners and writer Sera Gamble) along with deleted/unaired scenes on three episodes.""The Devil's Road Map"" is exactly that; a map of the United States showing where each episode takes place in the country You can click on each spot and see material from John's book with writers like Whitley Striber discussing the various monsters. We also see behind-the-scenes footage of the writers/producers discussing the creation of various episodes such as ""All Hell Breaks Loose"". These are essentially featurettes on each episode and they are kind of cool.  We also get Jared Padalecki's original screen test on videotape. The quality of the screen test is typical for home video cameras as it was really never intended to be shown. It's kind of cool to be able to contrast his first take on the character vs. the final performance from the pilot episode and subsequent character development over the course of two seasons.We also get three ""webisode"" featurettes including ""The Inside Scoop with Ivan Hayden/VFX Supervisor"" discussing the visual effects of the show, the overall look of these effects and how he approaches integrating the visuals into the show. ""Inside the Writer's Room"" which also aired on the ""Supernatural"" website during season two features writer/creator/producer Kripke, writer/producer John Shiban and producer/writer/director Robert Singer where the trio point out that the show uses Urban folklore as the basis for most of their episodes. Sadly we can't see the board with story ideas behind them. We also get glimpses of some of the storyboards including plenty of clips from the second season. ""The Inside Scoop with Chris Cooper"" is the final webisode included and features the prop master for ""Supernatural"" who discusses ""all the toys"" that the cast use on the show. Cooper discusses some of the fun stuff he gets to create including the guns and devices that Dean & Sam use. The amusing gag reel rounds things out including a very funny scene where Padalecki has a practical joke played on him during shooting.""Supernatural"" looks extremely good overall with nice color reproduction and detail. There are some digital artifacts and the images do blur a bit when there is rapid action on screen (which could be due to the fact that the show is shot and mastered in HD although it largely captures the ""look"" of film) but on the whole the show looks quite good.An exceptional second season with only a few dud episodes, I'd highly recommend the ""Supernatural"". The show has hip humor that manages to capture much of the fun elements that made ""The X-Files"" so memorable (and hard to reproduce as the failed but interesting ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" from 2005 demonstrated). As with the previous the discs are housed in a fold out case with a brief synopsis and credits for each episode.",1189814400,2007-09-15
4.0,"I gave this season four stars because I think it is better than okay but I really would have given it 3 1/2 if I could. A post apocalyptic TV show is both easier and harder to write than contemporary shows. The hard part is if you want to open it up to show what happened to the rest of the world and the pitfalls of doing so. By trying to do this, they somewhat diminish the characters we've been following. And adding aliens adds whole levels of pitfalls, many of which show up this season. It really hurts the &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; needed to enjoy any work of art to have aliens that speak English and that value exactly the same values, emotions and feelings we do. It just feels off. A knowingley silly show like Stargate Atlantis can get away with this but a serious sci-fi show suffers.",1376092800,2013-08-10
1.0,"Although the premise of this movie was somewhat intriguing, the characters, editing, pacing, and acting were not.  I've heard of slow, but THIS was slower than a 3-legged turtle.  It seems that aliens have landed and occupied earth six years ago, there is now an ""infected"" zone where you cannot leave, and a wall has been constructed in keep people in/out.  Yeah, I get the symbolism there, but this movie becomes an exercise in a very lame excuse to tell a love story.  I didn't care for either character, the monsters look like floating octopi, and I never felt the characters were in peril of anything--except their own insipidness (if that's even a word).  So go ahead and watch...BORE yourself to death...",1301875200,2011-04-04

4.0,"Wow. I feel completely different from most of the reviews here that state that the third season for ""In Plain Sight"" left them disappointed; I felt that it was a natural outgrowth ofIn Plain Sight: Season Twoand just as strong as the first two.SPOILERS:Season two opens with Mary (Mary McCormack)recovering from the gang shooting that nearly killed her at the conclusion of season two. She's uncertain where her relationship with Raf(Cristi&aacute;n de la Fuente)is going even though she accepted his proposal and she's frustrated because she can't recall the face of her shooter. Marshal (Frederick Weller)feels guilty because he wasn't there for her like she was for him when he was shot previously. She returns uncertain of how she should feel and wanting to jump right back into her witsec responsibility.END OF SPOILERS:The third season continues to be as entertaining filled with the droll humor of the first two seasons.I particularly liked the episode ""When Mary Met Marshall"" where we see how the two first met and how Mary was brought into Witsec.The DVD looks quite nice with a very good looking transfer. Audio sounds quite good as well.This season has some nice extras (although fans don't buy the show for that reason necessarily) including commentary tracks on ""Father Goes West"" Commentary with Series Stars Mary McCormack and Frederick Weller and ""A Priest Walks Into a Bar"" Commentary with Series Stars Mary McCormack and Frederick Weller (so someone must have been reading the reviews complaining about no commentary tracks). We also get deleted scenes, cast interviews and a photo gallery. I would have (**hint**hint**) a featurette or two on the production of the series and/or the storylines for each season, etc.Why doesn't the show get five stars? There were a few episodes that were a bit predictable in terms of the outcome and I'd like to see the writers take more chances with the characters/plots. Also, the boxed set could use a couple of featurettes on the production of the series just for fun.This is another exceptionally good season of the series. As with previous seasons even the weaker episodes flow and work well because of the chemistry of the main cast particularly the outrageously funny McCormack and Weller. McCormack and Weller are hilarious with great onscreen presence.Highly recommended.",1301788800,2011-04-03

4.0,"I have a theory about TV shows:  many good shows have been ruined by too much plot.  Sometimes a good and fun show gets carried away with story arcs that last for half a season, so that you just want the continued crisis to be over.  In my humble opinion, each episode should have its own ending or you aren't watching a show but a miniseries.  After season 2 of Suits started to take itself to seriously, I was afraid the show was doomed, but I decided to give season 3 another chance and binge watched it.  I have to say, it was worth it.  I enjoyed many of the episodes.

5.0,"Season 2 of Gavin and Stacey another step of this great situation comedy.  Not since the best addictive television comedies like Seinfeld and Cheers before it, has there been such a show worthy of a dedicated following--and sadly America doesn't even know about it. I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched all 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  The most annoying, off-putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing--the audience is watching him act.  His/her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  But the characters that surround them--their families and friends--are straight-up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people--just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom-ish--loving her prince of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm--is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6-pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip-hop song and choreography--with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around--quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister--another hip-hop master; and, an all-round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle, is embodied by Rob Brydon, from The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a minute too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can assist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head-to-head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter-dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  The only thing that an American audience might take a bit of getting used to are the British and Welsh accents...but please, give it a minute...the Welsh accents become another great joke.  This only negative about this comedy is that there are not 5 more seasons to hang out with these people.  This is a great, funny and very warm ensemble show.",1364169600,2013-03-25

Sort of like what a serial killer train wreck that takes a season to wreck.Characters, do have some depth to them, cast is for the  most part likeable and don't do too many things overtly stupid to push the plot along and there's someone interesting on Lector's (Remember, he's a cannibal and likes to have dinner parties with &#34;friends&#34;) table.There's a bizarre dream thing that looks like a cross between a stag (the animal) and a porcupine (small plates all over it's body), that our hero imagines.And you're pretty much guaranteed a fairly disgusting killing of some time each and every week.So far the entertainment value has exceeded the &#34;Geek eating the heads off chicken&#34; mentality of the murders, but just by a bit.Still watching it, first episode, first few minutes does promise some really interesting plot further down the season.Not really for kids, can be disgusting at times, watch at your own risk.",1394323200,2014-03-09
4.0,The show is off to an interesting start.  Titus Welliver is his usual solid self and does a great job in the lead.  The jury is still out on whether or not the writing will develop enough to hold one's interest in a time when there is SO much to watch of high quality but I'm hoping that it does evolve into a five star show.,1395360000,2014-03-21
5.0,"This is extremely addictive to watch, and very intense, I can't stop watching.  It is amazing what a human can endure.  You will get addicted very easily to this show, very well done, and unbelievable true stories",1394150400,2014-03-07
4.0,"I enjoyed this show immensely although being a senior, my ears are slow to catch all the English dialogue, which is a drawback in a mystery like this one was. Despite my old ears I was able to follow closely enough to catch most of it and especially to get the ending. I do like the English dramas and usually find them more true to life than some of our American ones. I will recommend this highly to my friends.",1394496000,2014-03-11
4.0,JR is as ruthless as ever. Would have liked more Sue Ellen and JR scenes but it is a good show and season. Even Cliff is back. JR's son John Ross is great and hot and sexy too. If you're a Dallas fan your collection is not complete w/o it.,1354060800,2012-11-28
3.0,I like the scripts but am not sure about the lead actor..sometimes I like his acting but I think it would be betterif he was a little more sarcastic. I know he has gottenvery wise in mind and body but with knowledge comes asense of humor and I would love to see him go just a littlebit more into what he is hinting at now...just a little more sarcasticafter all he has earned that no matter how grounded he hasbecome...The scripts are full of it I just wish he would take a littlemore advantage with the delivery..It needs that ZING!!! Forgiving isfine but complacent is just too much to ask..I'm thinking..But that's just me..,1401148800,2014-05-27
4.0,"Okay, many reviews are stating this was horrible.  I disagree.  If the movies &#34;Blair Witch Project,&#34; &#34;Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&#34; and &#34;The Hills Have Eyes&#34; were combined, they would produce this movie.  You have the shaky filming, faux-documentary style filming, similar to &#34;Blair Witch.&#34;  You have weird, hermit/hillbilly/backwoods killers, torturing people for unknown reasons, comparable to &#34;The Hills Have Eyes&#34; (although in fairness, the cannibals in the &#34;Hills&#34; movies ate their victims; no proof of cannibalism in this movie, just parts of bodies stripped of flesh, tossed into the woods.  I mean, if they were cannibals, would they toss away that much meat?)  Finally, you have some gore, complete with a fat man in an apron - and possibly a mask? Unsure of that due to the filming - similar to &#34;Texas Chainsaw.&#34;  Add to that, although I fully expected the type of ending this movie had, it still made me jump a tad bit in my seat, and that is a rare thing for a movie to do to me.  The acting was more than acceptable, storyline was loose - but there.  No questions were really answered, but it was still a satisfying flick.",1396828800,2014-04-07
5.0,I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend 5 yrs ago and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am hooked.,1362787200,2013-03-09
3.0,"This is another sloppy metaphor of all the struggles and compromises an artist must go through to produce something of any quality.  Don't expect any of it to make sense in a literal way.  It would have been more compelling if the sheriff had sued, threatened, or even framed him for a crime in order to get his ""fair share.""  The ""children"" and ""Poe"" seemed like irrelevant filler.",1377129600,2013-08-22
5.0,It is very interesting to see how the police and the justice systems work together in another &#34;western&#34; country.  It is also a pleasure to observe really good acting by all of the characters.,1398816000,2014-04-30
5.0,Enjoyed it.  Hope there will be more shows.  John Goodman great as well as all the other actors in the show,1367107200,2013-04-28
5.0,You don't absorb the whole series watching it one time. There is a lot of information to digest. I am looking forward to the next season.,1386374400,2013-12-07
1.0,"stream quality was poor and pixelated.  Show paused and froze many times, also requiring me to make a hard restart of my system just to get system working again.  Not sure why, but for now we are staying away from some of these, as much as we like them but they are freezing my Wii completely making it unresponsive.",1377993600,2013-09-01
5.0,This is the fourth year and it was as well written and filmed as the other three.  The characters are fantastic.  I think Edward Olmos has done a wonderful job in this series.  I liked this series better than the original with Lorne Greene.,1375574400,2013-08-04
3.0,"I want to see how this show develops, it definitely leans in one direction but based on who the writers are I kind of hope they twist it in more directions and doesn't go in a traditional post apocalyptic form.  The characters in my opinion were too stereotypical and that bothered me some but if they evolve it could be enjoyable to watch them",1392422400,2014-02-15
5.0,"This is so well-written ... beautiful stuff, really fascinating and thought-provoking.  And Morgan Freeman is a great host for the show.",1400803200,2014-05-23
5.0,I love sci-fi and this is a very enjoyable show.  The two main characters work well together.  Don't miss it.,1397088000,2014-04-10
5.0,"This show was so creative - interesting and imaginative story, great acting and production.  Loved it and would love to see more!",1392768000,2014-02-19
3.0,"It's got it good moments and b-movie moments. But overall, the movie is gory, and has some original stuff in it. It's definitely not a bad movie, but I don't like gore, so it doesn't suit me.",1397088000,2014-04-10
2.0,"This movie was less SciFi and more Zombie on Mars.  Don't get me wrong I like zombie movies, but I had hoped for a sci-fi thriller contagion kind of thing.  This was extremely predictable.",1402358400,2014-06-10
3.0,"Playback is a B-Horror film that in a sense is nothing more than a new take on the Amityville Horror. Instead of a demon possessing a house, the demon in this film, keeps his spirit alive on videotape, and when someone sees the tape, they become the next possessed killer. The story was entertaining but wasn't really anything new or extraordinary and the same can be said about the cast. The cast, led by The Covenant's Toby Hemingway, wasn't one of the most talented casts I've ever seen, but they may have been the best looking. There are some really good looking people in this film, and believe it or not, it helps to keep your attention. The film is a little dull and predictable at times, but there is always something nice to look at. This movie isn't original and won't shock or surprise you, but it may just entertain you for a couple hours and it will most certainly have your eyes glued to the screen.",1361491200,2013-02-22
5.0,"Ok we are hooked, fascinating pilot leaving more than enough questions to justify a full season. Chris Carter always gives 100% in originality. Why are they all together? Who was the creature? Make it!",1391731200,2014-02-07
5.0,I have watched this mini series 3 times and I love every minute of it. Every part is perfectly cast. Every line is perfectly delivered!!! Perfect entertainment.,1398470400,2014-04-26
5.0,"One of the main reasons I like this show is that it is a good fit for both me and my husband.Second the actors are awesome and I love she is a great fighter and is kicking ass.There is a lot going on in the show so you can see there will be depth to keep the show fun, new and interesting.FX is a great tv station and Fargo is next on my list.",1398902400,2014-05-01
1.0,I didn't watch this it lost my interest the first few minutes of it.,1405209600,2014-07-13
5.0,"I've loved Shark Week since it's inception, and through the years I've come to truly appreciate sharks of all types.  That being said, I don't put myself in THEIR environment anymore.  It's theirs, they 'own' it, they dominate it and I'm all good with that.  Still, I love learning about them, seeing them and watching the experts try to being understanding to we laymen.  That, I think, is what Shark Week is all about, although they do always bring the attacks to the fore, but that's because we, the viewers, are rubberneckers at heart and want to see blood in the water.I hope all will watch, learn and express their appreciation for the apex-predator of our seas.",1369526400,2013-05-26
3.0,I loved season 1 and was looking forward to season 2.  Something is missing and hopefully someone will do something about it.,1375228800,2013-07-31
5.0,Southland is a good crime drama. It makes you feel for the characters.It feels real. Police dramas that tells all sides of the issues are worth watching.,1313798400,2011-08-20
5.0,The second season so far is great. Love the actors and actresses.  I really wish the main protagonist ended up with Jack and not the switched girl.  But oh well. I'ts not my show.,1357084800,2013-01-02
5.0,"Though the TV show is a bit hokey for adults, it is more than suitable for the little ones and the original Fresh Beat Band songs are fantastic.  This quad (which consists of 2 young ladies and 2 young men:  Kiki, Morena, Twist and Shout - lol) have great singing voices, dance, play their own instruments and are always using their social and cognitive skills to help each other solve whatever problems arise during a particular episode.  While watching Nick Jr., I caught my youngest (at the time 16-17 months) dancing to their songs, smiling, laughing and pointing to the TV whenever they came on.  My daughter is now 20 months, still loves the show and is singing the songs!The Fresh Beat Band display very fun, energetic performances and while it seems their target audience might be between the age ranges of 5 - 10, younger children (and some adults ... like myself!) will enjoy the grown up sound of their music (cross between pop and hip-hop) and the positive messages they promote.This is a real band (not unlike similar/rival Disney ones) that actually tour the country!",1325894400,2012-01-07
3.0,"Although I've always liked Timmothy Hutton's acting abilities, I'd have to say in this series, his character is flat.  In the whole first season, it seems like the actors aren't really that interested in playing their parts to the full extent of their talents.  As a drunk, Tim Hutton seems to drag the show down because he is the leader of the group and impacts all the characters, so perhaps he is playing his role perfectly?!?Maybe next season, the characters will show more life.  Although I can't recommend that you spend your money on ""Leverage,"" I recommend renting it first (or watching some of it on the Amazon Movie program if it is available), and then deciding if you'd like to buy Season 2.",1348272000,2012-09-22
5.0,"Great actors, great plot, wonderful recreation of the Cold War era - overall, very interesting to see how it 'could' have really been - one never knows!!",1367625600,2013-05-04
3.0,"i didnt think this movie was as bad as some as the reviews.........i thought it was a solid nice sci fi movie......the idea was eerie & maybe it was some  kind of a re boot of society idea type of movie......i did find it odd the animals were able to survive the dark shadows....hmmm maybe cuz the animals are pure & didnt need re-booting & unlike humans who have been so jaded & corrupted etc they needed a fresh start.............maybe thats why the ending was the way it was.........the people left were the ""purest"" choice.......my only complaint was it was so dark for most of the watch but i still enjoyed it................",1342828800,2012-07-21
5.0,"This is a great, family friendly, show that helps kids with shapes and counting. It's fun entertainment and the kids love it.",1377561600,2013-08-27
5.0,"A cop story in part of the country I am unfamiliar with...keeps my interest up...Twists and turns of the County's character and the wonder about how the Marshal's love life will end up is another thing that keeps me coming back for more,,,Perhaps a bit too much killing  so it may not be best for the young set.....A great adult show...",1390348800,2014-01-22

5.0,"I got into this series a few weeks ago by starting the (free) first season. I kept watching through the whole series. I finished the first season in about 10 days. The second season is so good, I finished it in less than a week. This is a really great story, unpredictable enough to keep you guessing but not so far off base that you can't enjoy it.",1375660800,2013-08-05
5.0,fun entertaining episodes. this doctor is very good and energetic compared to other doctors. great way to pass the time,1397260800,2014-04-12

5.0,These woman are the reason I CHOOSE to have no female friends! All the bickering and arguing is entertaining to watch though. This city and jersey are the BEST real housewives! Thank you Bravo!,1345593600,2012-08-22
5.0,"Great show, just wish it was more than 13 episodes.  I am really hoping this show gets a green light for a second season.  I would really like to know how the rest of the story unfolds after that awesome battle finale.  If you are weary of this show don't be.  Laura Vandervoort was great in the show &#34;V&#34; but she really shines in Bitten.  A+++ show, check it out!",1400284800,2014-05-17
5.0,This was a very enjoyable series to watch. Well done and well acted.  We wish there were more of them - or more like this one.,1393113600,2014-02-23
4.0,"Very easy to watch, interesting story.  Abigail Breslin is fabulous as usual!  Worth the cost, glad I watched this film.",1402790400,2014-06-15
1.0,"I'm not going to waste much of your precious time with this review. 'Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie' is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen. Will Farrell and Adam McKay are credited as producers, and should have known better.The film follows the monumentally untalented duo, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, as they set out to make a film for one billion dollars. They end up wasting the entire budget, a fact which the film's producer - Tommy Schlaaang (Robert Loggia, obviously working for the paycheck) - is not entirely thrilled about. The two idiots decide to renovate an old mall in hopes that they will be able to pay off the large debt. In the meantime, we are introduced to some of the most annoying, disgusting characters ever written, and are treated to insanely crude jokes involving pedophilia, feces, and body piercing.The writing is horrendous, the ""jokes"" are beyond disgusting and incredibly unfunny, and the two leads are headache inducing morons. Rarely have I ever been tempted to walk out of a film mid-screening. 'Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie' is a waste of celluloid. I hated every single second of it.Magnolia Pictures has given the film the royal treatment on Blu-ray, which includes an audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.Directed by Tim and Eric, Rated R, 94 minutes",1345075200,2012-08-16

5.0,"love the show --we watch it and have a blast,  in this case dorks are wild.  keep up the good work",1366416000,2013-04-20
3.0,"I watched Helen Mirren in every episode of this show when it first aired on BBC in the UK.  She was absolutely magnificent in the role.  I suspect how much you like this show will depend on whether you saw the original series starring Mirren. I can't say this is a terrible version of the series.  However, the whole thing turns on the lead actress and her desire to climb to the absolute top of the homicide heap.  I didn't think this actress had the same ability as Mirren with this character.I also wonder about such blatant sexism being practiced by the NYPD with the USA's EEO laws.  The entire first episode is a flagrant violation of those laws and we learn in seconds that this is just one series in a long episode of her cases being handed over to the men in the office.  The USA is so much more litigious than the Brits that I simply can't believe she isn't seeing a lawyer and shortly receiving  a hefty settlement along with any homicide case she wants to handle.",1317427200,2011-10-01
5.0,This show is also consistently entertaining.  Each week revolves around a different murder that Bones (Temperence Brennen-the forensic antropologist) and the FBI agent Booth.  Bones has a very different & tactless personality which Booth tames.  These two were finaly married in Season 9.  So there is a strange pairing of the two at the center of the story.  Highly recommended!,1384905600,2013-11-20
2.0,"We watched the pilot, it was okay...enough to make us curious about a second episode.  So we started the second episode and about 10 minutes in while they are investigating a crime involving a stripper they go into the strip club and then the dealbreaker for us was when the female deputy gets up on stage in full uniform and starts dancing around the stripper pole, undressing and down on her knees to supposedly get information out of the male patrons.  It was so lame and once a show has to objectify their female professional lead in such an unrealistic way...we are out.  It means lazy writing and that they are targeting an audience that we don't belong to.",1370044800,2013-06-01
4.0,This series is set in DC during the 1980's--Reagan's administration.  Two KGB agents are told to marry and assimilate into US life.  They have two children who know knowing about what their parents really do for a living.  The fact that they live next door to a FBI agent who is with a counter-terrorism unit makes it all the more interesting as they are always on the edge if being found out.Series is very realistic. No James Bond stuff.  Just solid spy craft and missions which are eminently believable.It is addicting.,1395964800,2014-03-28
5.0,"Doctor Who, season 7. enough said. This part 1 of the season leads to even more adventures and exciting revelations of the who Doctor Who family, and the prequel to the 50th anniversary season!",1385683200,2013-11-29
4.0,Good  movie but in chinise. It should be better if this was in english. but it was a good movie.,1394323200,2014-03-09
5.0,"This is a great show that shows that being supernatural does not mean you do not have personal issues and you cannot save the world in 1 hour. I loved the characters that had different abilities and personalities. The running arch was ongoing but if you miss an episode you can catch up. They give an autistic character a major role and he is an internal part of the team, not a person who needs to changed.This show is terrific and you should be able to watch it over and over, it is that good",1372809600,2013-07-03
3.0,"What was up with this season? They totally changed the hard work put into season 8 and changed everything! The whole Andy as the manager got threw out the window for some reason and he was gone for half the season. Then, his relationship with Erin got messed up in the process. Their characters were made for each other for like 3 seasons. They liked each other at different times secretly, and when they finally got together in Season 8, that was amazing! Now, in Season 9, they just threw away 3 seasons of hard work into the trash. WTF?Pam and Jim was pretty much a boring topic/storyline in season 8, so there wasn't that much to talk about, but in season 9 they were constantly being shown. I didn't really care for their story as Jim and Pam had problems with their relationship and work. In this season, I would say 75% of it was about these two characters, trying to figuring about themselves so this is your A story right here.Now, your B story would be about everything else. Dwright is always in every show and I think it is because Andy was missing for half the season. Dwright is looking to become a family man and I thought this was the most interesting story that I liked this season. He wants to be with Angela, but she is in the pretend marriage with the senator. This goes on for a long time, until Dwright gets a new girlfriend and possible wife material. Then, at the end, he finally has to choose between his girlfriend or Angela. I would had chosen the new girl, because Angela is such a Bitch. But, okay, I could see why Dwright chose Angela.I didn't like Erin as much as I did in other seasons. Manly because her character got changed so much and Andy wasn't there and some other younger guy liked her. Those two as a couple just doesn't make any sense to me. Erin is a somewhat older than this young guy and she is at that stage were she going to get married soon. (I thought Andy was going to marry her.) The young guy is at that stage were she having fun and meeting a lot of girls still. Well, anyways, everything fall apart after one episode were Andy figures out a plan and to try to break make them feel bad about them being together, and after that they weren't really ever mention as a couple ever again. So, that story arc just closed off.I didn't really like the last episode. It wasn't as good because they needed to make Michael Scott do more than have him there and not say or do anything. All he did was smile like a crazy person and didn't say anything and it looked really weird. They should of had him do something funny, while he was there.I wouldn't recommend this season to anyone that actually liked season 8. If you are interested, you pretty much need to watch the last few shows and that's it. The whole season isn't worth it until then.",1387324800,2013-12-18

5.0,Season for went out with a bang and season five came back with a bang after 12 years off the air futurama is back and hopefully to stay for a long time.

2.0,"And most of those opportunities were wasted.  The actors are good, but the writer(s) should have been getting shots in on both parties.

5.0,"This is a great summer series. I am anxious for every episode! It's got a great story about the dome - but even more interesting is the relationships between the townspeople when things start to become scarce. I had read that Stephen King said it was also an environmental statement about how the earth's resources are limited (but he doesn't hit you in the head with his mission like many TV series do--if I hadn't read his interview, I wouldn't have realized it was even environmentally related). This has also made me very happy that I have Prime because I was able to catch up with the 2 episodes that I'd missed.",1378425600,2013-09-06

It is hilariously funny because I can relate to the way the guys deal with situations on the show. My cousins, brother, and friends tease like they do on the show.People now, seem to take themselves way too seriously, and this show is refreshing because they kid, tease, and have fun. Then at the end of the day everybody remembers WHO is really to be taken seriously (Jesus).",1382400000,2013-10-22

5.0,"The show is a great start to what will hopefully be a full season.  Bill Murray's breakdown in the first few minutes is comedic gold and the rest of show keeps rolling from there.  The characters all reside in an atypical frat house and seem quite settled in their arrangement.  The real juice of the show comes from the fact that they are all politicians, seasoned at that.  I like that the show did not delve to heavily into political intrigue, but kept it a light, satirical level.  Great show, funny, witty, excellent cast ( looking at you John Goodman)...seconds please!",1367539200,2013-05-03
4.0,"I really enjoyed this show. It was well acted, and written. I would be happy to watch this if it where to go to series. So far I have watched &#34;The After&#34; and &#34;Mozart in the Jungle&#34; and this was by far my favorite.",1392163200,2014-02-12
5.0,"We anticipated a new season and they are better than ever. Great Program and I love it. Characters are so real to everyday life. I believe they could do a better job in correcting their kids to send the message that kids need to have ground rules and need to be corrected when they break them. Too much for the lady lawyer to do, it seems.",1383091200,2013-10-30
4.0,"Are you old enough to remember the 1986 version with Demi Moore and Rob Lowe? I am. It's a story as old as time: We watch two couples make their way from the bar to the bedroom and then come face to face with the real world (with a dining-room table).Director Steve Pink (&#34;Grosse Pointe Blank&#34; and &#34;High Fidelity&#34;) clearly understands the dynamics of the dating game. He knows how important it is to have sympathetic characters, even though they may sometimes misbehave. Audiences want someone to root for.Here is the updated cast:* Kevin Hart (&#34;Ride Along&#34;) has the old Jim Belushi role of Bernie, the guy who is absolutely determined to limit his dating to one-night stands. I don't remember Belushi being this funny!* Regina Hall (&#34;The Best Man Holiday&#34;) in the old Elizabeth Perkins role, is Joan, Bernie's erstwhile one-night stand. This gal can give as good as she gets and this couple's verbal timing is amazing. What a team!* Michael Ealy (&#34;Last Vegas&#34;) is our new Danny, formerly played by Rob Lowe, who discovers that all he really wants is a home... and maybe a dog. He is a genuinely nice man with all the right instincts.* Joy Bryant (&#34;Parenthood&#34;) is Debbie, formerly played by Demi Moore; Bryant owns this role, with a sweet likability and generous appeal.* Christopher McDonald (Lots of TV) is Casey, the friendly owner of the faltering neighborhood bar where our folks hang out.This R-rated comedy (raunchy language and sexual situations) is laugh-out-loud funny and much, much wittier than the original. The dialogue is so rapid-fire I found myself reaching for my remote: (&#34;What was that?&#34; &#34;What did he say?&#34;), so I'll probably buy the DVD from Amazon, because I know I missed some great lines.I was one of the people who blurted out with laughter in one scene when I realized that they were watching the 1986 original on TV; I recognized it right away. The younger folks in the screening audience had no idea what we were laughing about. ...sigh...",1392681600,2014-02-18

5.0,"The Poirot adventures with David Suchet--which began nearly a quarter century ago and just recently concluded--are some of the best classic British mysteries on television. That they were saddled for years with crappy DVD transfers was a shame. But now you can enjoy pristine Blu Rays of the original Super 16 footage; they look fantastic. If you watch your Poirots as much as my wife and I do, you owe it to yourself to pick up the Blu Rays. It's well worth buying the shows a second time.",1386633600,2013-12-10

3.0,If you have readUnder the Dome: A Novelby Stephen King you will find that it's sorts of poor adaptation of the excellent novel so far. The acting done by characters are OKAY but nothing spectacular. Some episodes are technically imperfect and something to quibble about but still Amazon offering this free for prime members was a good move. I did finish watching the whole season 1 using Amazon Instant video and I am looking forward to the conclusion. I hope the producers of the series adapts to the original novel in their forthcoming episodes.Okay to watch it once if you are into SciFi. May be get it again when it is available at my local library for a second look but would not invest on DVDs or Blu-Ray.,1377734400,2013-08-29

4.0,"A documentary that speaks power to truth.  I adored this documentary made from a TED talk like I do most of the TED talks.  That and $5 gets a cup of coffee.  What I always walk away from watching something that comes from a TED talk is, well, you have to be pretty darned rich to get to attend a TED talk.  Those folks listen, donate some money, go home to sleep on their satin sheets, and feel really good about knowing the truth.  I watch one of these, love em, then go to sleep on my cotton sheets, and feel really good about knowing the truth.  Nothing's changed.  Poor kids starve, wars happen, and the rich get richer... to where they can afford to attend a TED event and leave feeling better about themselves.  Somewhere surely there are some solutions.",1379635200,2013-09-20
3.0,"This is a showcase for the lovely Kelly Reilly. Lovely as she is, without decent writing and direction, Ms Reilly cannot carry the load required to make Above Suspicion just that, above suspicion of being a hackneyed attempt at the usually honorably presented British police procedural. The writing fails to deliver credible dialogue. It fails again in its attempt to highlight Ms Reilly's gams and bosom by dressing her in NSFW tight skirts and blouses plus having her prancing through crime scenes in too high heels. Three stars because all of its many failures make it quite entertaining to the armchair critic. May have fared better if presented as a light sexual farce for the top-button set.",1405814400,2014-07-20
3.0,"Some movies need to be seen even if they aren't necessarily great movies. ""Sky Captain and the Land of Tomorrow"" would be one of those titles. Is it a great movie? No. But it's a great achievement. Never was there a movie before that looked or felt like it. The visuals are stunning and it somehow manages to achieve a look that is both futuristic and retro 40s at the same time. ""Metropia"" is also such a movie.This is an animated movie....kind of. I've not read up on the technique, but it looks as though there is live action melded in with animation. The look itself is intriguing. Add to that the fact that the characters have oversized heads and it crosses over into creepy. It takes place in a dystopian future and the production design depicting the various indoor and outdoor scenery also has a very disquieting look.Similar to ""Brazil"" and ""Metropolis"" the viewer is faced with a repressive society where the population is being controlled and monitored. Now even the shampoo is working its way into our minds to help the process. The main character, Roger, hears voices that he's beginning to suspect are not the result of mental instability. When he hooks up with ""The Shampoo Girl"" he becomes involved in a plot to take the whole rotten mess down.The plot is OK. Aside from a couple of twists, there is nothing particularly clever in the way things unwind. It is good enough though to hold the viewer's interest. What really works are the visuals. This is simply mesmerising. I've never seen anything even nearly like it. It also profits by the use of good voices. Vince Gallo, Juliette Lewis, Udu Kier et al help move things forward. The sound design is also good. It helps add to the oppressiveness of it all.If you're into the weird and wonderful in films. If you're wanting to see the possibilities in film making, then this is a must see. If you're waiting for the next ""American Pie"" installment, don't bother.",1290124800,2010-11-19

Kate (Newton) and Martin (Murphy) are in marital trouble. After their first child is stillborn they find a house on a secluded island to stay in and try to work things out. Things are going OK until a stranger shows up on the island. This is a movie that is made by the ending. The entire movie is pretty slow moving and boring in some parts with only three characters in a house for most of the movie. If you stick with it though you won't be disappointed. The ending makes you re-think everything that was said in the movie and makes it better then it could have been. Overall, a bad movie with a good ending. I give it a C+.",1325376000,2012-01-01

5.0,"I'll admit, it's a guilty pleasure watching Ramsey go Full Metal Jacket each week on a bunch of chefs who continuously screw up cooking scallops, Beef Wellingtons and halibut. It should be repetitive and nauseating but it's really not. I find myself compelled to watch episode after episode of Ramsey berating and screaming at the contestants while learning very little about food along the way.Here are some of the things I did learn from this season include:- Don't overcook scallops. They get rubbery.- Don't under cook fish. You'll get screamed at.- Communicate with your team even though you're competing against them.- Don't lie to Ramsey. You'll get screamed at.- Take up smoking if you plan to appear on this show.Although I experienced this season on Amazon streaming, one of the bonuses of the DVD version is that it's uncensored so you can experience the full filth of the insults. Long time fans know that the guy bleeping out Chef Gordon has the hardest job in television and he's given a blissful reprieve on the boxed sets. Otherwise this season features some imaginative challenges, punishments and rewards and while it's more focused and extreme than previous years, it's basically more of the same. Which is exactly what the fans need.",1371081600,2013-06-13
4.0,"These were the highlights of this one for me:1. Details of Carson's early life and the experiences that may have motivated him to host a television show. There is evidence his need for approval may have come from a mother whose approval he sought - but never quite felt he received. There is also a fascinating timeline of Carson's first television shows, not all of them successful. He was, of course, in the right place at the right time and able to take advantage of television's first days.2. Interviews with other comedians as well as those connected to the Tonight Show (Ed McMahon, Doc Severinsen). It was both interesting and touching to hear the admiration and awe from people like Dave Letterman, Jay Leno, Ellen DeGeneres, and so many others who credited Carson with paving the way for them - as well as being the benchmark for excellence.3. Clips from the Tonight show as well as other programs featuring Carson. I did wish some of the clips were longer or showed the full segment, including a hilarious one where Carson is surprised by a baby orangutan and another where Doc Severinsen discusses Thanksgiving plans with Carson. Both deserved to be seen in their entirety, instead of as excerpts. So I'm deducting a star for that.Both diehard Carson fans and those who want to know more about him should find this worth watching.",1342483200,2012-07-17

Then the footage is not edited at all so when she stops and starts over you want to scream, &#34; just say something... anything ... stop licking your lips and rolling your eyes!!!

4.0,"This television series is really interesting and intellectually stimulating.  I watched it because I love James Spader, back all the way to Stargate.  I haven't seen him in any other of his shows, and I was sorry to miss the one he did with James T. Kirk, but we didn't have HBO at the time.  James Spader is a bright, talented actor, and I enjoy his style.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the plot, though fascinating, is somewhat questionable.  My disbelief has not been wholly suspended.  People who sell out to heinous criminal activity, rarely turn around unless they have had major epiphanies or traumatic life-changing events.  It hasn't been revealed yet, but I am curious to see how it all falls out.Otherwise, the drama and storyline are well done.",1394755200,2014-03-14

Due to realizing I do not watch much TV, I canceled my cable TV but it does not matter. This is the ONE show I look forward to seeing. The only one. I now PAY to see episodes the day after they air. It is worth it to me without having the burden of cable or some other service or some device like a TIVO to bother with. Very good writing, plotting and yes acting. Even the bad guys are likable. Good science fiction. Upgrades in their special effects I have seen for season 3. It is a very positive show in my view. Some very honorable characters. Great to see Doug Jones of Hellboy fame as an alien (again!). Best show on television for a sci fi enthusiast.",1371081600,2013-06-13

It started in 39 when he failed to Invade England and waited on the worthless Goeing to win the Air War.  His hesitancy lost it again in Russia when he turned his Panzer Generals away from their original objectives.  Hitler was a megalomaniac whose fears were fueled by his use of drugs and his diseased brain to map out strategies that were doomed to fail.  Good thing for the Allies it did fail or we would all be speaking German though I wouldn't have because of my Father whose career in military intelligence would have doomed all of us in our family to extinction!",1399766400,2014-05-11

4.0,"Spoiler Alert:I think the surprise end is what sealed it for me. I think I get the point they were making (or were they?). But then, it doesn't explain why all the other deaths have occurred at the tentacles of the monsters. It seemed like they were displaying non-aggressive and inquisitive creatures, who probably attack when provoked only. Yeah, that explained the death of the couple's parties, as the guys went with guns blazing (to save the other family?). But all of the deaths?Some gaps in the plot. The wall was open. It looks like it was not a gated opening so much as just open. And what would be the point?Why was the girl down in Mexico anyway? Why did Dad want her home before the migration?Why was a passport necessary to get on the ferry? The man had already seen it, and allowed them to purchase a ticket. Another family coming to the US was clearly Mexican (sans passports obviously).Well some questions, but we excuse the gaps because the story wasn't about precision, and the romantic dance at the end was somewhat profound.",1395964800,2014-03-28

4.0,"Watching the modern Doctor Who one-off specials has certainly become an unexpected Christmas tradition in our home. And each Doctor brings his own spin to the holiday themed episodes. Last year Matt Smith's Doctor took on Dickens in an outer-space interpretation of ""A Christmas Carol."" It was frenetic and funny, managed to seamlessly blend tragedy with humor, and was emotionally satisfying without being cloying. This year, we had ""The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe"" (its central plot point borrows from a certain literature classic--I think you can figure out which one). This may well be the most straightforward and heartfelt Christmas special yet. Set in World War II era Britain, Smith helps a family adjusts to what promises to be a painful season by making a perfect getaway experience for the kids. However, with the best of intentions, one of the Doctor's surprises leads to unexpected dangers. The family must work together to ensure their very survival and get back home.The special capitalizes of an eco-friendly theme as the principle aliens within the piece are not your typical beasts. They too are a race battling to live as manmade intrusions into their environment threaten their existence and livelihood. Might the Doctor and his charges be of assistance? It is Christmas after all. Or as certain annihilation looms, might it be too late for anyone to survive? This is Doctor Who after all. The show's pacing is brisk and its storyline affirms a strong message of loyalty and family. In fact, the Doctor's exposure to the widow and her children make him contemplate those that he has left behind through the course of his exploits.While many of the past Christmas specials were completely independent, ""The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe"" actually fits comfortably into the timeline of the on-going series. With a minimum of screen time, the show's finale packs an emotional punch that really resonates and sets up future episodes. And while, in truth, the main story was pleasant enough--it is these last few minutes that really distinguish this special and make it memorable. Smith is crisp and amusing as always, but it is Claire Skinner (as the mother) that really gets some nice dramatic moments. All in all, this is a very well balanced presentation. And, especially due to the last few moments, it is one that I will remember. A solid 4 star episodes with a simple but effective 5 star finale, I'd rank this as one of the sweetest (and possibly best) Christmas specials yet. KGHarris, 12/11.",1324944000,2011-12-27

This week I screamed out loud, and I can't think of another TV show that has made me do that! I'm a fan of the original Psycho movie, of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. And as a fan of that classic, I can honestly say that this series is doing it right. I absolutely love everything about it. The casting especially! This young Norman -- Freddie Highmore -- is a powerful actor and nobody could do this challenging role better. He IS the young Norman. And that MOTHER -- holy creepy sympathetic jeebies! -- Vera Farmiga is perfection. Loud whistles, huge rose bundles, tons of chocolate and gallons of champagne to the writers of Bates Motel -- extremely challenging, and every week you knock it out of the park, line upon line.Can't wait for more.

5.0,Very good and very entertaining very informative as well. It probably helps that I'm Scandanavian and spent time in Sweden and recognize many of the names of places,1387497600,2013-12-20
5.0,My four year old grandbaby absolutely loves Diego.  She can't get enough and learns well from the format.  Well done.,1398470400,2014-04-26
5.0,"It looks like The Walking Dead has really hit its stride with a superbly executed series 3 opener that doesn't waste any time at all. Months have passed since the end of season 2 and our group is short of food, ammo and conversation. All the soap opera squabbles are over, with Rick firmly in charge and everyone - including Carl - going for head shots on anything that moves and murmurs.Season 3 has also upped the zombie body count substantially and there are some inventive new zombie kills too. The comfort (and growing viewer boredom) with the farm is far behind us as the team have retreated into a prison where a whole array of new problems await. The prison promises some excellent twists and surprises for upcoming episodes judging by the trailers.The Walking Dead established itself as one of TV's best shows in the first season, then lost its way a little in the second, but is absolutely back on track. It's grittier, darker and more dangerous than ever before. The only question is -- who's going to get infected next?",1350259200,2012-10-15
3.0,"I loved the X-files so I wasn't too surprised that this hooked me. However, not to sound prudish, I felt like it was a race to see how many f-words could be said in an hour. I don't mind a few but this was a bit over the top for me. Having said that, I would like to see where the show is going but not if they continue with language like that. It makes me feel as if the writers don't have enough imagination to come up with better dialogue.I will probably watch another episode to give it another chance. I am quite intrigued.",1392249600,2014-02-13
4.0,We knew the outcome of this one and it was still good.  It was a different take on the island Survivors.,1397779200,2014-04-18
1.0,not worth your time...were Kennedys so absorbed and lack faithfulness as portrayed. Shame on the Kennedy men! Poor acting. Couldn't get past the first episode,1379030400,2013-09-13
1.0,This animated sci-fi pilot waan't all that interesting to me.  I like sci-fi but only occasionally watch animated series.  I don't think I am the right demographic for this show.  This would likely appeal to young adult males.  So I don't think I'd watch any more of this.,1366934400,2013-04-26
5.0,This show is well done though at times I feel like going out to stand in the sun after watching it. The theme is dark and the lighting is often dark. Very well done.,1403395200,2014-06-22
3.0,"Very nicely produced series, a great deal of very beautiful scenery but there are times it seems like it's a advertisement for the national park service..",1401408000,2014-05-30
5.0,"I love this guy that spends his life making animals fit in to lives where owners have no clue what they're doing usually. I mean this makes a good case that cats are smarter than some of the people that care for them.EXAMPLE: Having two cats and then buying a ""Ridgeback"" dog that is totally bred to chase and corner cats for a living!!! Then they scratch their heads wondering why this has gone bad and the cats fight with the dog. Just more selfish, stupid owners wanting what THEY want, and no concern for whats good for anything or anyone.My only small criticism about the show is that it seems every episode has the same solution.Exercise the cat until they can't stand up, and provide areas of retreat up high in the house on ledges. All the rest has not much to do with the cat as it does with the dumb owners.EXAMPLE:""Yes we clean the litter box for the two cats about every two or three weeks OR SO!!""I mean OMG....please......someone take the cats away from people like this and give them a home with someone that has a clue what love or caring is about.( the litter box needs to be cleaned every two or three days)Anyhow....Jackson is a great human being, doing some nice work and I love the show.Once again the problems are usually always not the cat as much as it is the owners, so most problems can be dealt with. Mr. Galaxy shows a lot of love for cats, and more patients for people than I have for sure. Good program!!",1365465600,2013-04-09
5.0,I have been a Rupaul fan since the early 90's.. and he does not disappoint!  This show is very funny.. and over the top crazy at times.  For the most part..the queens are likeable.  Quite entertaining!!,1362441600,2013-03-05
5.0,This is truly a good show. It is more realisitic than alot of the older shows. Tom Selleck just seems to get better and better with age.,1356652800,2012-12-28
4.0,"The last season of Chuck is almost as fun to watch as the previous seasons. Almost because you know it's going to end. There are only 13 episodes, but there's a lot going on! I enjoyed it and can highly recommend the final season on CHUCK.",1348963200,2012-09-30
5.0,Yes it was wonderful and I enjoyed it very much would watch again in a heart beat well thats all for now.,1376524800,2013-08-15
4.0,"got a little tired, it seems.  But you can't go wrong with Walton Goggins he is a great actor, we will at least take a look at anything he appears in.  This is such a good show overall it gets 4 stars.",1398816000,2014-04-30
3.0,"Laying the foundation for the story line took way to long, and I way to much screaming,  a few scary minutes near the end...",1390867200,2014-01-28
5.0,"I've followed the story of Temperance and Booth ever since the beginning and I am charmed, beguiled and in love with all the ensemble characters.  I also really appreciate the way they've all been allowed to adapt and develop.  It keeps the story fresh and original.  I know it can get a little silly and unabashedly romantic sometimes, but the scientific appearance and jargon, the excellent writing and the interaction between the personable charm of Booth and the beautiful remoteness of Bones balances it all out, for me, anyway.",1395619200,2014-03-24
5.0,I can never guess what is going to happen next.  The writers are great at building in sneaky twists and turns to always keep you guessing.  The sets are amazing too!,1353369600,2012-11-20
5.0,"Very good movie, my husband was surprised I could rent it before it hits the movies!!We'll buy it for sure too, it's a great watch, moving, great acting as always:)",1388880000,2014-01-05
5.0,"If you like the geeks in The Big Bang Theory, you'll like the one's in Betas.  Betas leans to more drama, but is still very funny.  If you're a part of the Internet startup generation, you'll probably relate well to the characters, location, and story lines.  The acting is above the bar, you believe the characters and situations quickly.  So far, each episode follows closely after the previous one -- great continuity.  Betas is one of my new &#34;must watch&#34; shows on Friday, or Saturdays.",1388361600,2013-12-30
5.0,We like to try and guess which house the people on the show will choose. Relaxing and fun show! Gives great ideas also for decorating!!,1389139200,2014-01-08
4.0,I like this series very much. Placing it in The Hamptons allows for a much larger range of settings and plots than the typical medical show set in a hospital. The characters are really engaging and the actors are talented. I look forward to each episode.,1348185600,2012-09-21
1.0,"Yes, 9/11 was horrific and for those of us who were not there I'm sure we can't imagine. I began watching this on 9/11/13 just to remember what had happened, part of the way thru I had to turn it off because the descriptions and so forth were so terribly graphic that it was disturbing. Don't watch this movie if you are sensitive to very graphic descriptions of the horrors of that day.",1379462400,2013-09-18
5.0,Please offer more of these with prime!!  Really enjoy them. Having a son that is moving over seas makes this extra good.,1394236800,2014-03-08

3.0,"Okay storyline, but it would probably have to get rewritten several times before it would be ready for the actual big screen.  A bit clunky overall, but I feel like other studios have released worse in the past.",1333756800,2012-04-07
4.0,"I like the chemistry of the two main characters, this show is the intersection of stoners, nerds, and officer workers: the genre clearly in a sci fi world with evil overlord( overlord is pretty generic) two protagonists stuck in jobs they hate working for a company they view as evil.",1366329600,2013-04-19
3.0,It just isn't close to life..She is running around like a chicken a real Doctor doesn't do that...I don't know just could get into the show that much. Mobs and medicine is one of my favorite you see I'm a movie buff...,1363478400,2013-03-17
4.0,"I really enjoyed this show! Its really hard for me to fully review a tv show or movie because I am the kind of person who will gush and give spoilers and that is def something i dont want to do.But if your into the viking period and war this movie is def for you.

5.0,"Four seasons in, and this show just keeps getting better. It was nice to see more background story on individual characters - hopefully there will be more of that. The story line between Carl and Rick was also well done, as they seemed to have weathered a storm, and come through on the other side. 112 ounces of chocolate pudding...talk about making up for lost time (and childhood treats)!",1393027200,2014-02-22
3.0,"It was an interesting movie.  Very off beat.  Make no mistake it is a horror movie and a little sick and twisted.  I had read the description and its not a film about paranoia or anything like that.  I don't want to ruin the movie for others so I won't give away the story. But, you'll need a strong stomach for this one and in the end you may still shake your head.  I gave it three stars because it is so unusual.  It was not my type of movie due to the nature of the film.  Family drama?  Really?",1371427200,2013-06-17
5.0,I was forced to watch &#34;Gunsmoke&#34; and &#34;Rawhide&#34; every week as a child. I hated it. I did not think I would voluntarily watch a tv western. This is not a 50's western. It has all the kitsch of the 50's with the topics of today. Timothy Olyphant  is a primo Sheriff.He has personality plus. All the characters are interesting misfits. I watched the first 3 season one after the other. I am doling outSeason 4. Unusually well written and entertaining in every way.,1390176000,2014-01-20
5.0,"Don't know why this show didn't last longer than it did, although....I am a Jeff Goldblum fan and I've found that most people are not. Liked the subtle humor, witty sarcasm, and character interaction.  The premise was unique and opened the show to a lot more episodes than it enjoyed. Too bad.",1390867200,2014-01-28
2.0,"I like Titus Welliver.  But, this show seems like a bad adaptation from a mediocre crime novel.  It does not adequately transform whatever the original material was into an interesting television show.  It seems like an ABC show that would be cancelled mid-season.It's a throwback to 80's noir TV dramas, but lacking in depth or interest, with cliched, hackey dialogue, and some incredibly lackluster supporting actors.I was utterly uninterested after several plot developments and didn't care at all about any of the characters.",1393027200,2014-02-22
5.0,"This show is like watching a train wreck. It's science fiction but it's a lot of horror, too. Sometimes, I had to force myself to look away. I gave it four stars because I enjoyed watching it and they kept the suspense up but yikes!",1397001600,2014-04-09
3.0,"Like other bad habits, I watch this weekly and while it is not good for you, it is fun to watch.",1383436800,2013-11-03

5.0,Psych gets better and better with each season. You won't be disappointed by collecting this series. I noticed thou for the first time that both my purchases had the words disc made in Mexico on the plastic cover-what's up with that. Either I never noticed before on all my Amazon purchases of tv shows are made in Mexico for sale in USA and Canada only????,1301356800,2011-03-29
5.0,Tim Allen plays a great part in this show if you want to laugh and relate to family life this is a great show. He outdoes himself in this one.,1363737600,2013-03-20
1.0,"Well what else is there to say about a show that starts with ""warning: show contains musical numbers"".  I would never watch this show, I couldn't make it through even one episode.  I found myself horrified and disgusted.  Musicals are for Broadway, not TV.",1366761600,2013-04-24
5.0,May sound corny but I love the Walton-like feel of this show. It still has modern characters and plots but love the fact that all characters value integrity.,1383696000,2013-11-06

5.0,I absolutely love the series! I wait anxiously every week for the new episodes to come out. I love the twists they have created for each fairy tale and I especially like that the princesses are tough and can kick butt!,1390521600,2014-01-24
3.0,"Certain episodes are comic relief, that's for sure. The amazing thing is there are actually people in the world like these guys, and that's scary knowing so. If you want a good laugh it's worth watching.",1400630400,2014-05-21
5.0,I wasn't sure I would like this program but it is Stephen Kings best work.  It has such a variety of odd stories that you can't wait to watch the next.  I never get tired of watching them over and over because of such unique tales,1378857600,2013-09-11
5.0,Archer is beyond the coolest show ever made :-)i could have done without the 3 minute long spoiler at the end of the first episode though :-) lol still insane awesome though.,1392768000,2014-02-19
5.0,This is season two of the most intellectual horror story on TV. A departure from season one in that now the scene is in a insane asylum run by devilish nuns. Very cool story.,1388016000,2013-12-26
5.0,I can't believe I'm saying this but MTV has a winner in awkward. It's genuinely funny and has some pretty great characters. Some of the love plot lines are ridiculous but the characters keep growing on you. Good for a mindless weekend watch.,1374624000,2013-07-24
3.0,"Acceptable adventure film of the sword and sandals genre, set in Roman Britain, has some Roman soldiers, survivors from a massacre against the bloody Pict tribes, fleeing behind enemy lines. Historically dubious (the ragtag platoon includes, seemingly for PC reasons and ludicrously from a historical point of view, a black roman soldier), this violent and bloody, muscular and masculine film is, for all its flaws, certainly entertaining. I found this better and more enjoyable than the recent, similarly themed Eagle of the Ninth. The pristine, misty Scottish outdoors where this movie was filmed certainly helps. Acting is not the main point of this movie, as the actors have to put up with some terse, rough lines. Michael Fassbender, who was fine in the more recent X-Men film, fails to make much of an impression here as the top Roman soldier here, but Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko, is surprisingly OK as the top warrioress of the Picts.",1314403200,2011-08-27
5.0,The first season of this entertaining series introduced us to the various cast and their histories and agendas the second season gives us more on both the creatures of the Grimm Stories and the shadowy agenda that lurks in the background.  If you've seen Supernatural then this is another series to add to the collection as while there are obviously major differences with the stories and characters both are at the end exciting and entertaining to watch.,1379289600,2013-09-16
4.0,"Still a fun and fast moving series.  Looking forward to Season 4.  Looks like we have lost some of the beginning stars, so let's see who joins the team now.",1400630400,2014-05-21
4.0,Daria is hilarious in a weird geeky way. It is like insight to what a nerd feels and is treated.,1398211200,2014-04-23

1.0,"I loved this show when Bones was a strong woman scientist but as time has gone by, her professionalism has been reduced to an emotional flaw that must be guided by an emotionally superior man.  No longer enjoy watching this.",1383091200,2013-10-30
5.0,"Castle is well-cast, with lots of witty banter between cast members and sharp, well-written scripts.  It's good to see Castle and Beckett finally together, although it remains a minor plot line.",1377216000,2013-08-23
5.0,Dickens  writing reflects the darker side of humanity but also the redemptive power of love and kindness.  This story stays true to that formula.  Portrayal of all the characters in this story is very well done by many of my personal favorites.  Clare Foy and Matthew MacFadyen are excellent.  Judy Parfitt is brilliant in her role and Andy Sirkus is creepy and despicable which is what he does best.  My husband did not want to watch this at all but quickly found it interesting and intriguing.If you appreciate all things British I highly recommend your investment of time.,1392854400,2014-02-20
5.0,I enjoyed this show from the first one I watched and will continue buying the season DVDs to watch uninterrupted by commercials until they quit making them.,1392854400,2014-02-20
5.0,Stargate Atlantis is one of my all time favorite series.  The cast is excellent and the plot takes a couple unexpected twists and turns that keep things interesting.  Just finished going through the series a second time and am sorry they didn't make one more season.,1392336000,2014-02-14
2.0,"So far not liking this season any more than the 8th season.  Come on SPN writers let's get back to what made this show great for seven seasons.  Please stop with the stupid hunter characters and bring back Garth.  Please write Kevin's character better and please don't turn Crowley into a good guy.  Please find a great female counterpart for Dean, I miss Dean with women.  Stop with the heavy handed Bromance and bring back Castiel.  Also the bunker is okay but its not cool and if you've forgotten this is a show about the dark and creepy; about two guys on the road, not in a bunker.  Kind of tired of sorry, whiny, non cool angels, and that included Zeke.You had a cool concept the men of letters, something destroyed them, why? not that would be a great plot point and could really drive the mythos forward.  Please don't let this show go out like this.",1383436800,2013-11-03
4.0,"Some Episodes are better then others, but some Episodes are really good I enjoyed the season opening and ending I thought really good tv which is why I gave it 5,  Sometimes I wish Seasons were shorter so they could drop the weak episodes.  but in this case the weak episodes were not unwatchable  which is why I gave those a 3, so average out a 4It does have the cliche drug war view of 'drugs are the worst thing in the world'  and 'police have to bend the rules to get results' but not so bad that it distracted from my enjoyment.",1399161600,2014-05-04
5.0,I was not sure that this series would be good but was familiar with Inspector Lewis from the John Thaw series.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well done the shows are with interesting scripts and good acting.,1386201600,2013-12-05
3.0,"Like a train wreck or car accident, Under the Dome hooked me and then reeled me in. There were moments where I hated every character, well except maybe Linda the cop. The only way to watch this was on Amazon video - the commercials were just way too many and annoying to sit through an episode. About midway through the series, the writers moved the series in unpredictable directions. I know they had to make an incredible cliff hanger to entice people to watch season two, but it was almost too much over the top.Where the program really went wrong in a major way, was when the young Angie was imprisoned by Junior. That was beyond creepy, beyond what the writers should have ever done. I really hated those episodes. Some might consider the following a spoiler, so be forewarned. Now that part is finished, the series can move forward.I'll watch season two. This is a series I love to hate.",1382140800,2013-10-19
5.0,"I've watched all the pilots now and Onion News Empire is a brutally efficient laugh machine, reminiscent of the movie work of the Zucker/Abrahams crew back in the 80s when they were still funny (Naked Gun, Airplane!, Top Secret).  The other pilots range from pretty good to pretty bad; this was the home run.  Dying to see more.",1366588800,2013-04-22
5.0,I'm a big fan of this series. The constant fight with the wraith is exciting and makes for good character development. No worries no spoilers here but expect Ann exciting season with very high stakes.,1398211200,2014-04-23

1.0,Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature. In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him. Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth. You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys. This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature.,1391817600,2014-02-08

1.0,"I couldn't finish.  The premise made me believe it would be right up my alley, but this show wasn't even mildly amusing.

5.0,"One of the best pilots in the running, this show has a lot of great rapid fire comedy and superb writing. Jeffery Tambour is hysterical, and steals every single scene he is in. Yeah, there's definitely some jokes that don't really work, but there is plenty of potential here, unlike some shows that I could mention that may or may not involve Zombies (seriously just the idea itself automatically writes itself into a corner) I would love to see this show get picked up. And more Jeffery Tambour. I know he's doing Arrested Development, but I need more Jeffery Tambour. Seriously, I really hope this show gets picked up, it's one of the few 'comedy' pilots that is actually funny.",1367280000,2013-04-30

3.0,"This has been renewed but most of us had to buy the eps online because it was NOT shown on Dish.  This series is basically remaking the modern horror classic , &#34;from dusk till dawn'  and doing it in  long drawn out way.  The first 35 or forty minutes of the movie are now stretched over six episodes.  And we just get to the good part when the series ends! . The part where the female vamp is dancing and soon they will all turn to vamps.  In the series we have more characters because we have more time.  The movie was  full out riot and remains a horror favorite from the 90's for many.  This is a decent version of it But if you might want to wait till the next season to watch it all together as the next six eps will redo the wild second half of the original movie.",1398124800,2014-04-22

4.0,"This is really not about Jeffrey Dahmer.  It's really about Detective Patrick Kennedy, or make that ex-detective Patrick Kennedy more like it.  Mr. Kennedy is a hoot.  While watching I thought, ""This guy should be a comedian!"" since he adds some levity to the situation, even though he was fully involved in the capture and conviction of a serial killer.There is a scene where Mr. Kennedy is describing Mr. Dahmer's apartment -- the killer's refrigerator in particular -- and the detective talks about that refrigerator being opened and someone noticing a box of Arm and Hammer baking soda right next to a human head.  Now, I'm not exactly sure that that would be a product endorsement or even a product placement (and yes, ""placement"" is a double-entendre here), but maybe it is.  And while this humor was very dark, it was very funny as well.  Even Mr. Kennedy seemed to think so as he smirked a bit thinking back to the crime scene.But Mr. Kennedy seemed to take his job very seriously as well, and later I thought, ""Well, maybe this guy should be a college professor instead.  He really knows how to succinctly give instructions, in order, on how to perform some task.  And he seems to like to share that information with others.""  At the end, as the credits roll, you will see that, indeed, while he didn't go the comedian route, he wisely chose the professor route.  I believe that he now is a professor at the UW-Milwaukee.But of course, we have some secondary characters here as well, in particular Jeffrey Dahmer.  He was certainly one of the oddest serial killers ever -- maybe even stranger than Ed Gein, who lived right down the lane but existed in an earlier time -- and I'm not convinced that Mr. Dahmer wasn't insane.  After all, if you do what Mr. Dahmer did, how can you NOT be insane?  If he's not insane, who the heck is?  This does not mean that he is not guilty, however.  It just means that psychologists need to rethink their definitions.  (A next door neighbor gal was also a very sympathetic character in this movie.  She implicitly raises the point that Americans make the fatal mistake of tagging others guilty through associations.  That might be a minor theme to this film.)Well, this may seem like a comedy, but is rather more of a tragedy.  But it was great watching someone such as Mr. Kennedy use levity -- in a respectful way, however -- to a tragic situation.  And this would be a pretty big recommendation by me.",1363910400,2013-03-22

Now the customer drops off the item, and then, two scenes later, it's just done and being presented to the customer. You only get a brief summary of what they did, but you rarely see any of it anymore. It's a shame. I hope they get back into that some day.

Sad that the  movie trailer has you  thinking otherwise.  I sat through almost half the movie before I had to turn it OFF.  The folks who are rating this movie 5 star must be part of the filming and acting crew.  Great premise but the monster is throw up ridiculous looking and my gag reflexes would not stop and not because of the movie.

3.0,"When people react to a situation in a way that is neither believable or appropriate we quickly lose sympathy for the characters. This pilot is not terrible however you see a bunch of people playing out classic, and rather stale, caricatures. The acting isn't bad and the production is good although the action sequences seem oddly discordant and fail to flow naturally. Would police really ignore an officer in need of assistance? Repeatedly? Would an officer shoot instantly when an unarmed man charges them, yet wait patiently for people carrying shotguns, and with obvious ill-intent, to disembark a cramped car? No, she would assess the tactical situation and take them down as they try to exit the vehicle. Perhaps I expect too much from a police officer, but clearly her reactions are inconsistent with one another.As others have noted, hanging on to the back of a vehicle is completely nonsensical. It is incredibly hard to hang on to a vehicle in such circumstances and indeed why would you even try? The officer is incredibly vulnerable and hanging on for grim death she can't possibly deploy her weapon without falling off!So now we can guess this is ""supernatural intervention of the apocalyptic kind"". This kind of subject has been beaten to death so I can only hope they've figured out a new twist on the ""judgement day"" metaphor. The question is: do I want to see more? The pilot doesn't do enough to sell me on the story line (whatever it is) and I don't care enough about the characters to be bothered about their fate. However I would be willing to watch a few more episodes to see how it pans out.The program does have its moments, such as the actress using her audition lines to fool a self centered opportunist. I get the feeling the director either isn't vested in the program or is an amateur slightly out of their depth. This is by no means the worst pilot I've seen and indeed there are regular scheduled programs such as The Following which are far more annoying and ridiculous. So maybe it has a chance. Or maybe not.",1392768000,2014-02-19

3.0,"It's beautifully animated.  But it sorely lacks in the story department.  The show plays more like a -- surprise! -- game show (which is what Blues Clues and Super Why! both essentially are).Plus, there's a big fundamental problem with the concept:Because the protagonist (Bianca) can grant any wish she likes, there's no real conflict anywhere in the show or in any possible story.  If something goes terribly wrong anywhere in an episode, we're aware that Bianca can ultimately wish the problems away.For instance, when the little boy says he wishes he wasn't afraid and Bianca turns to camera and says, ""He wishes he wasn't afraid.  What should we do?""  Well, the obvious answer is for Bianca to grant his wish to not be afraid.  Instead, she inexplicably refrains from doing so.  Why?  Because if she did grant his wish to not be afraid, then that would be the end of the story.The way to play this beat in a more interesting and dramatic fashion is to have Bianca attempt to grant the boy's wish, only to have the wish backfire so that now he's even more afraid to go onstage -- in fact, because of Bianca's wishing error, he's now petrified.  As a result, Bianca has to decide if she should risk wishing yet again for the boy not to be afraid.  What if the wishing goes doubly wrong?  That's when she decides to help the boy by taking direct action, in a real-world way that kids at home can relate to, instead of by attempting another wish.To make the show truly dramatic, her wishing should have as many negative consequences as positive, so that you then have recurring conflict in the plot and an actual story to tell and a theme to explore -- instead of these little disconnected and relatively conflict-free vignettes.As it now stands, the few times Bianca screws up her wishing, it's merely for comedic effect.  Never for conflict or drama.  A huge story-telling engine totally squandered!  ""Be careful what you wish for!""Looks beautiful though!",1391644800,2014-02-06

4.0,"Hollywood is full of adaptations, sequels, prequels, remakes, re-imaginings, reboots, and spin-offs. The bottom line is that most movies hitting the big screen are familiar territory. When something original does come along, it usually ""borrows"" elements from films that influenced it or pays homage to said influential films that came before it. Truth be told, at this stage in the game, technically everything has already been done. Everything has already been written about or filmed or drawn or created digitally. All that's really left out there is the really bizarre topics. The stuff that you either think up randomly one slow Thursday evening or is obviously the result of one of the heaviest acid trips in history. I like to think that Rubber falls somewhere in the middle...of all three categories.Rubber pretty much had me at Lieutenant Chad's (Stephen Spinella) opening monologue. Hell, he gets out of the trunk of a car just to illustrate the point of ""no reason."" What makes this scene special is that it kind of breaks the fourth wall while also introducing the secondary storyline of the film. Lieutenant Chad explains what we are about to see to the camera and then it's revealed that there is a crowd of people there who are also about to watch what transpires on screen. Mind you, they're watching with binoculars and their fates are kind of questionable given the film's primary storyline, but it was one of the more unique ways to start off a film.Rubber is Robert's story. Who is Robert, you may ask? Robert's a tire; a car tire, to be precise. He wakes up one day to find out he likes to roll over anything that gets in his way, but once something more solid crosses his path like a beer bottle is when things get even crazier. Robert discovers that he has telepathic powers and he uses this gift to make things explode. It starts with a beer bottle and shifts to animals. As Robert lives life to the fullest just rolling around the desert and blowing up whatever his little nonexistent heart desires, he eventually stumbles onto a road into town where he becomes fixated with a woman. Not only that, but we get to see how his special powers work on humans...It's difficult to fully describe a film like Rubber. Its genius use of absurdity is practically overwhelming. The acting is a bit over the top at times, but really solid overall and fits the overall tone of the film like a glove. Stephen Spinella practically steals the show, but Jack Plotnick definitely has his moments. Okay, you got me. It's mostly the turkey scene and his heart to heart with the man in the wheelchair (Wings Hauser) that made Plotnick relevant. Rubber offers a little bit of everything though; comedy, drama, horror. There are a few seriously memorable one-liners buried in the film (""No, come on. It's not real life. Look at you, you have a stuffed toy alligator under your arm."") and it's kind of incredible how you almost come to understand the thought process of a car tire by the time the film ends.Rubber certainly isn't going to be a film for everyone, but you pretty much know what you're getting into with the trailer. The people who hate it probably have justifiable reasons; it's ridiculous, it's unbelievable, it's impossible; it's the dumbest thing ever. It's hard to argue with any of that, but I loved it for all of those reasons. Some people may see ridiculousness, but I saw originality, creativity, and unpredictability. Isn't that better than most of the clich&eacute; tripe that somehow makes all this money at the box office?Rubber is brainless fun covered by a veil of uncertainty. If you can accept the outlandish premise, then it's incredibly entertaining. Rubber has that same kind of vibe that Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans does; it's bizarre and eccentric on the surface, but kind of brilliant at its core. It'd probably be fair to call Rubber cheese, as well. But dammit if it's not some of the richest cheese I've ever tasted.",1305331200,2011-05-14

5.0,"This is not a contest of who is the better English Professor.  Sorry....Hell's Kitchen this year I think is very different in some ways and the same in others....In past years, and I have seen every season, and own every season, You can a lot of times see who might get to be in the final four, if a little harder maybe the final six.  This year, the cast of chef's are so different, I can honestly say it is really fun to see who will start to emerge as a front runner.  Usually you can tell at least one person by now who might be there near the end. Not this season.  They all seem to be chef's without a clue!  lol  Which I love by the way.  The Personalities are very vast and it makes for interesting television. Now I believe in many seasons they make the guys seem to be a bit nuts where ""their lights are on but nobody's home"".....Well there has been a shift in the last few years where the woman are now the ones who are clearly off their rocker.....This is not a put down.  It is simply good television and fun to watch.  Also, this season, they are not pushing sex as much which honestly, I am glad about. Every show usually has sex in it, or eye candy for men and woman.  This season, it is just about the best Chef for the Grand Prize, which is working directly for Gordon Ramsay himself.  This is not for another restaurant, this is a direct executive position working for Gordon Ramsay.  And of course the first year salary of 250,000 dollars.  But this is only for the first year.  Now, the challenges are similar, some of the guest Chef's are similar, and the one thing I do like is that Gordon Ramsay does seem to do something good for our troops in different branches of our armed services.  No matter what our political views are, I think we can agree it's nice that they give the troops a nice treat by feeding them and thanking them, and celebrating the sacrifices they give up.  Gordon is as explosive as ever and maybe going for a record in throwing people out of the kitchen.  There is more lying and back stabbing going on with the contestants. In the end, as it is more of the same, it is every much that different.  Gordon was giving an interview about the contestants and asked what he thought.  I have to preface this by saying people who do not know the show have a tendency of saying ""they make the same food all the time and it's not different"".  Well, that is true to a degree.  Gordon said ""they come in thinking they practiced the dishes before they enter the contest and they think it will be easy.""  Gordon laughed.  The truth is, learning how to make the fine dining food, and perfecting it, and putting it out perfect while on the line every single time, is almost impossible to do.  The two left that can do it the best and adjust the quickest fight for the title.  Also, they do not make the same exact food every night. There are many nights where they do different types of food from comfort food, children's food, to different cultural types of cuisine, and then finally right down to breakfast and burgers......Hell's Kitchen has everything.  And by the way they were just signed for season 12 and 13.  Hell's Kitchen is also in primetime up against other good shows, and it has been compared to Top Chef, which is on cable tv, and has not been on as long as Hell's kitchen and has not been signed for the type of extension that Hell's Kitchen has been.  I feel Hell's kitchen is as fresh as it's ever been and as fun as it's ever been.  And this season is great because they are all a bit eclectic and from all walks of life, and so far there is nobody who looks like they can cook!!!  lol lol  So it will be fun to watch them evolve as they get to the finals.  If you like Hell's Kitchen, You should take the time to watch.  You just cant go wrong.  It has everything....Just a side note, Masterchef is doing well, kitchen nightmares was also resigned, and we have ""Hotel Hell"" to look forward to as we head into July.  Enjoy everyone...Also, if you really want to understand the man himself, Gordon Ramsay, get both his books about his life.  You can get them for less than two dollars. And that will change the way you view this man forever.  He truly is an amazing hard working man.  And more importantly, a great family man.",1340064000,2012-06-19

4.0,"Three Norwegian college students made this documentary as a film studies project. We know them only by their first names, Kalle, Johanna and Thomas. Although this film was given the unfortunate name, Troll Hunter, it is primarily a disturbing educational experience. Some of what a viewer sees might seem unnecessarily bloody and frightening, but this is what these students found after they attached themselves to a reclusive, surly bear hunter. I will only say that this man, Hans, and his superior, Mr. Finn Haugen, worked for the Norwegian Wildlife Board. As we and the students later learn the men actually were employees of the secret government agency, the Norwegian Troll Security Service (TSS). This agency, it turned out, was created to kill trolls and hide their existence. Outlandish? You must watch this documentary film. This film was released only after the students disappeared and their work was discovered by the side of a road.The film is presented as it was discovered, from snips and pieces made by the students. Kalle was the cameraman, Johanna was responsible for the audio, Thomas was the on-camera commentator. We do not know their last names, only that they were students from Dottmar College. They were three young people dedicated to their project, sometimes frightened but with a deep desire to learn and to record the truth. They have never been seen again, and we do not know their fate. Many suspect the TSS might be involved since it since has been learned that the TSS has been attempting to cover-up the existence of trolls for many years. This was discovered only inadvertently when the Norwegian prime minister, Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, inadvertently confirmed the existence of trolls during a press conference.In the course of these students' film we encounter the Tosserlad, the Jotnar and a group of young Ringlefinches, all huge beasts with gigantic noses, long arms and covered with filthy hair. We see how gigantic are these beasts, towering over forests and wreaking destruction as they move. We learn that their inability to convert vitamin D into calcium makes them vulnerable to turning into stone in sunlight as their bodies over-react to UV rays. Unfortunately, (because of the likelihood of sensationalism), the students also record terrifying chases through dense dark woods, bloody encounters and frightening suspense. There is the sacrifice of a goat to snare, I believe, a ringlefinch. The young goat bleats its fear.Some of what the students filmed simply is not appropriate for children. Indeed, even the preparations for approaching these creatures might seem too disgusting for family viewing. The application of trollstench, particularly to the armpits and groins, is vulgar. This substance is so foul to the nostrils that gagging usually is induced. Trollstench is prepared by cooking down the difficult-to-collect bodily wastes of trolls. This, however, is essential if one is to disguise one's own scent, particularly if one is a Christian. Trolls are enraged by Christians. Yet as fearsome as these huge beasts are, they are susceptible to disease. This might be, the students learn, the cause of troll rage.Kalle, Johanna and Thomas framed their story around Hans, the trolljegeren (or troll hunter). Hans might not be as reliable as the students think. Yet Hans undoubtedly knows his trollsCall Troll Hunter what you will - a documentary, cinema verite, or simply a student college film project. It remains a remarkable record. Any who have managed to watch that other classic documentary, Forgotten Silver, will not regret watching this.",1334102400,2012-04-11
4.0,"I'm enjoying this series (I don't watch enough TV to know if it's been renewed) and if there's a second season, I'll watch that. There's a lot of drama that borders on melodrama, but hey, we are dealing with teenagers here, so high emotions and melodrama are de rigueur, right? The show is well cast, with good looking people, so on the eye candy factor alone, it is well worth watching. That said, the acting has been good as well.  And while I am getting tired of zombies and vampires and all creatures supernatural, the werewolves in this show haven't bored me yet.",1399766400,2014-05-11
5.0,Great series! Great writing! The characters really stay in the 60's focus.I did not watch Vegas until a friend asked me if I was watching and told me how good he thought this series was. It IS extremely good! Dennis Quaid is the perfect actor to portray Sheriff Lamb.I downloaded the whole season (rental) from Amazon for about $19.00. I have one more episode to view. I will surely DVR this series when it returns on cable!,1356739200,2012-12-29
5.0,"A very well written comedy, perhaps with some cheesieness, but still an enjoyable, light comedy with Betty White moments of sheer brilliance.",1392940800,2014-02-21
3.0,"This is my favorite of the pilots this season. Despite a silly premise and some stereotypical scenes, the characters are likeable and fun to watch. Josh Peck did a great job playing the GM and Natalie Zea grew on me throughout the show. Lots of great, light comedy. Just the show to unwind with. I am not a big football fan, but still got a lot of the references. 3 stars because while entertaining, it's basically a pro-football version of your classic Underdogs movie.",1393113600,2014-02-23
5.0,Liked the first season but the second is even better. Gets more into the characters pass and how everything came to be. Love how these characters are evolving and growing. Can't wait for season three.,1380240000,2013-09-27

5.0,"Betas is a show about how a group of young people created a start-up company.  The show begins with them only days from going live with the business.  The show tracks four Silicon Valley friends who think they have cracked the code to financial success.  The show stars Joe Dinicol, Karan Soni, Jon Daly and Charlie Saxton.  The show was created by Evan Endicott and Josh Stoddard.My first impression is that I really liked the show.  It takes an inside baseball look at how high tech companies are created.  The show lets you peek behind the curtain of how crazy and risky technology companies can be.  I enjoyed the show and I would definitely recommend it to others.Thank you for reading my review.",1387497600,2013-12-20
4.0,"Metropia is a 2009 Swedish production that has flown completely under-the-radar, despite fascinating and innovative animation that accompanies the pretty basic science-fiction storyline. I only came upon it by searching for Vincent Gallo films on Netflix. The availability of Metropia is a story itself. You can get the DVD or stream from Netflix, you can purchase a copy of the DVD on Amazon, and yet Wikipedia claims that this film will be released in North America by Paramount Pictures in 2012. Hopefully this last piece of information is true as it might garner this film more exposure.The plot is pretty standard sci-fi fare. The story takes place in Europe, 2024; the world is running out of oil and Europe's underground subways have been connected into one large underground tunnel called The Metro. Roger (Vincent Gallo) is a lugubrious call-center worker, paranoid about using the Metro, who begins hearing a voice (belonging to Alexander Skarsgrd) in his head. Soon the tries to turn Roger against his girlfriend Anna and his paranoia continues growing. After seeing the model whose face graces the bottle of dandruff shampoo he uses, Roger follows her. The woman's name is Nina (voiced by Juliette Lewis) and his involvement with her gets him entangled in a conspiracy involving the Trexx Corporation and its overlord Ivan Bahn (nightmarishly voiced by Udo Kier).Mind-control, paranoia, technology, dystopian world, muted colors, etc. Standard sci-fi stuff, but delivered with a European flavor. The story is intriguing but slow-moving, requiring patience from the viewer. It only runs 80 minutes, but if you're not ready to invest yourself into the film than steer clear until you are. There are times when it moves at a snail's pace, but even at its most tedious it always remains fascinating to behold. It's the animation that you will take away from watching it as it makes the film more accessible and adds a certain amount of depth to the actual story as well. The animation was done completely through manipulation of still photographs. People and locations were photographed, edited in Photoshop, and then animated in Adobe After Effects. This may give the impression that the animation is gimmicky or cheap, but it makes Metropia an experience like no other.This animation is both stunning and innovative, lending great atmosphere with its muted colors and making Metropia a visual experience with the potential to become a cult sci-fi classic. The nods to Orwell, Hitchcock, Philip K. Dick, and perhaps even David Lynch help too. If you have any worries about the film looking too ""computer-generated,"" let me assure you: this style looks more realistic than the motion-capture stuff that Robert Zemeckis has been championing for years and Spielberg is having fun with for his upcoming film. It's a slightly demented style, but one that draws you in.The voice work is perfect, providing you have no qualms with the story taking place in Sweden with two main characters that are obviously American. Gallo gives a surprisingly tender and sensitive vocal performance, while Juliette Lewis provides a perfect amount of sexiness and intrigue. Kier, meanwhile, is absolutely frightening. The voice work is very subtle and nuanced, avoiding cartoonish theatrics. Like everything in the film, it's downplayed and appropriate for the gloomy tone.This is an animated tale for adults with a mature storyline and the occasional moment of adult content (although there's nothing too graphic). It's a cold film with a strong emotional disconnect that fails to make an astounding impression, but it will stay with you simply because of how terrific it looks and how well-acted it is. It's no masterpiece, but it deserves to be picked from obscurity and exposed to more people as it's an impressive achievement.GRADE: B+",1322092800,2011-11-24
4.0,To be fair I only gave this outstanding comedy four stars because I have only watched two episodes and so I cannot judge the whole season.  If you remember Laugh In with Rowan and Martin from way back when you get somewhat of an essence of what this comedy team is all about.  This is true cross-over comedy as both are bi-racial and the comedy is only richer because of it.  Active and energetic this team brings a new dynamic into comedy.  Skits are good and well thought out and a pleasure to watch.,1403654400,2014-06-25
4.0,"Audio and video quality for this season was fine, as usual.Plot was not as well-written as previous seasons and glaring errors are just overlooked.  Still a fun show but it seems to be running out of fresh material for drama.  And there is almost no sign of Booth's son, Parker, which is annoying but understandable as the young actor's aging really puts a timeframe on the series.",1387497600,2013-12-20

4.0,"Duck Dynasty is entertaining, and wholesome, but I'm not sure it is profitable in any way.  The characters are so much different from most people that it's hard to relate.",1400198400,2014-05-16
2.0,"I have to admit when I first started watching this show I was prepared to dislike it intensely. I'm not a huge zombie fan to begin with, too much grossness what with falling body parts and their predeliction to snacking on the living plus the screaming just doesn't usually make for the kind of entertainment I enjoy. But the Walking Dead Season 1 charmed me enough with it's believable, intriguing characters and end of the world as we know it depiction to get into watching it. And I found myself enjoying it immensely even though I had to hold a pillow in my lap to block out the more squeem-inducing moments. (If you've seen the show you know what I'm talking about)Season 2 was equally great, more so since now we knew the characters enough to care about their fates and/or even be annoyed by some while growing to love others. WARNING: SPOILER ALERT HERE - But then when Shane died at the end of Season 2 I thought, ""Uh-oh, am I going to even like Season 3?"" Granted while Shane wasn't the greatest humanitarian he was THE main source of the internal conflict amongst the group. It made watching the series so worth it for me since I was by turns fascinated, frightened and even sometimes sympathetic of his hoped for role as savior and hero being upstaged repeatedly by his best friend, Rick. It's enough to drive a man mad and sure enough that's what happened to Shane and then Rick, every the shining hero put an end to Shane's life. And sadly the best source of internal conflict on the show too. This left me wondering what Season 3 would bring. I heard about Michonne and that seemed like a good thing. A kickbutt woman with a katana? How cool will that be, right?And then Season 3 arrived and with it my feelings of growing...boredom. Sadly Michonne's character is taking forever to develop and sorry, but having the actress run around looking angry all the time while not saying much does not endear her to me. I know Michonne's a strong, silent warrior type, but I don't know why since she's just not been given the time and attention her character needs to take it's place in the overall story. The Governor is also boring since again we know he's a bad guy who seems charming on the surface, but not really why outside of the usual cliched ""former nobody finds himself in power and aims to keep it that way no matter who he has to mow down along the way"" villian. And the survivors themselves haven't really gained much in the way of new developments either. All of this leads to a not very compelling story to watch and maybe it's just me, but I find myself having to use the pillow in my lap alot more this season. Even in places where I don't think we should have to like did we really have to see Hershel's foot getting cut off? That coupled with the fact that things just keep getting worse and worse and worse and there's no real reason to care or goal to be had makes me feel that this story is simply another one of the walking dead, shuffling along with a blank stare on its collective face. And I'm so jaded by this point I just dance out of the zombie's way a little bit then don't even bother with the head shot since it really just isn't anything I'm interested in dealing with now. For me anyways, this show is dead.",1354060800,2012-11-28
2.0,I love the Onion site but not this tv show. I wanted to like the show but could not it was just not as funny to me. They do a lot more riskier jokes on thier site I think.,1368576000,2013-05-15
4.0,This is a very dark series with vivid crime scenes of grisly murders.  Not for the faint of heart.  Hugh Dancy is a super actor who does an excellent job of portraying a very sensitive very broken FBI agent.  Hannibal is bonechilling.  Very good series with a lot of plot twists.,1393977600,2014-03-05
3.0,"Eliza Dushku is on the cover of these DVDs and gets the most screen time in most episodes. However, Dollhouse's greatest strength and weakness is that it's not really about Eliza Dushku or her character. Let me explain.The concept behind the show is brilliant. A company programs people to serve clients in whatever capacity needed, from prostitutes to criminal investigators. The show really shines when it tackles the moral and ethical questions around this. Joss Whedon is very good about never portraying the company behind the Dollhouse as ""evil"". The characters running the Dollhouse are flawed but realistic and even at times sympathetic, yet they are engaged in this practice of servicing people. Fortunately, most episodes show us enough of this to make the show interesting.As for Eliza Dushku, she is ""Echo"", one of the programmed ""dolls"" in the Dollhouse. As such, she's generally not a character who makes any important decisions or engages in the compelling ethical drama described above. Rather, pretty much every episode she is brainwashed and made to serve a new client. This is where the show sometimes gets bogged down into a ""client of the week"" format. While Eliza Dushku can act, her acting isn't dramatic or overwhelming enough to make every new version of her character interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, this also means she doesn't really show any character development over the course of the series - after all, she's a new person each show.Eliza Dushku and her character ""Echo"" probably take up most of the screen time in Dollhouse, which is a shame. Her story - to the extent there is one - just isn't that interesting. However, there's enough of the other material to make Dollhouse worth your while.  When watching the show, I'd recommend paying attention to what seem like the ""background"" characters more so than Eliza Dushku. Some of them, such as Amy Acker's ""Dr. Saunders"", are absolutely brilliant. In a way, to get the most out of the show, you have to shift your focus from Eliza Dushku to everybody else.Recommended - 3.5 stars.",1366675200,2013-04-23
4.0,"Great character development, interesting interactions and excellent plot. I feel the episodes are somewhat disjointed, the first episode was excellent and hooked me.

5.0,"""Damages"" is that kind of show that has you on the edge of your seat  completely confused as to what is going to happen next and in utter surprise when you discover each piece of the truth. It was one of the best shows of last season without a doubt. The show centered around Ellen (Byrne), who begins to work in the lawfirm of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) who is a ruthless, self-serving and completely unpredictable lawyer. She focuses her work on a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher (amazingly played by Danson) for insider trading. The first scene of the first episode shows Ellen running half naked in a raicoat covered in blood in the streets of New York. In each episode we discover a new piece of the puzzle and the events that led to that first scene. The past/present technique is masterfully used making each viewer very involved in solving the mystery. The performance of actors is excellent and the show is amazing. Damages is truly a great show.",1202083200,2008-02-04
4.0,"I feel like a turncoat for giving this set only four stars, since I generally find the series to be top drawer.I have a few simple reasons. First, it is abbreviated, to only 15 episodes, filled out to 19 with four added from Season 4. Second, it is a transitional season, where Zach Addy, one of my favorite characters, is written out of the series with a MOST, MOST improbable conclusion to episode 15 and Dr. Lance Sweets joins the cast as a guest character in this season. I was not entirely keen on two of the main story arcs of the season, the return of Temperance Brennan's family, especially her father, played by Ryan O'Neal and the Gormagon narrative. Two other arcs, Sweets' book on Booth and Brennan and Angela's search for her Brazilian husband are pretty good, as they help introduce Sweets, and make the Angela / Jack romance more interesting than just constant dalliances here there and everywhere.The first two episodes from Season 4, which take place in London, seem to breath fresh air into the series, and promise good things. I also miss the early tension in season 2 between Brennan and Saroyan, and a more stable character in Zach Addy.",1375315200,2013-08-01

5.0,"Fabulous.  Four terrific mysteries presented on four disks, all featuring the greatest sleuth since..............?Hercule Poirot (vividly portrayed by David Suchet) is called upon to solve some confounding murders.  The first disrupts his holiday.  A cantankerous old man fears someone is out to kill him and all the suspects are his relatives.  (""If I had an enemy I'd cut his throat."")  The second case is far more complicated, involving thefts, smuggling, and murder.  The third case, Murder on the Links, comes about when Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser) has ulterior motives for the vacation `they' are taking.  They end up at the Hotel Du Golf and fall into a trap of instant intrigue.  The last mystery is the most fun.  It features the best guest star they've ever employed.........Bob, a dog with ball and just one trick he doesn't mind endlessly repeating.  ""Dog!

The drug must be injected every 36 hours or the person reverts. There is a short supply of the drug as it is derived from the spinal column of dead zombies. Kate (Emily Hampshire) is a doctor who treats &#34;the Returned&#34; and has a boyfriend Alex ( Kris Holden-Ried) who is a music teacher and one of them.Kate buys treatments under the table. She has to battle against the societal prejudice against &#34;zombies&#34; which has become a politically incorrect word. It takes about 40 minutes to develop the plot and character.The film has parallels to homophobia and various prejudices, after all who wants their sister to marry a zombie? There are anti-return groups and killings.The main problem is when the movie picks up it still moves slow. I kept waiting for something to catch and hold my interest. The ending was a yawn in spite of the attempt at being a dramatic twist. Not exactly a zombie film.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity",1393459200,2014-02-27

2.0,"Suspension of disbelief is a necessary element to enjoy any form of fiction, but this television show asks a bit too much.  The beautiful people travel from their glass and steel post-modern architecture museum (presented as the CDC) to exchange a few cleverly laconic lines with the suspiciously overly-suspicious scientists conducting what are obviously evil-minded experiments at an arctic facility the extravagance of which would make Dr. No blush.Many details of this program display a lack of research or, worse, indifference to real life and to science.  Not all sci-fi needs to be hard, by any means, but this show pushes the envelope a little too far.  We have internet, now.  Even screenwriters can fact-check basic things.Finally, there is the obvious love interest: a perfectly plausible, model-gorgous, mid-twenties super-scientist with 15 years of qualifications and experience, swooping in on our remarkably suave leader in obvious conflict with his ex-wife, who is also on the small team of scientists.  I can see where this is going.  I just don't want to sit through it.Overall, this is like watching a Saturday morning cartoon stirred with soap opera and garnished with live actors.

2.0,"This is a review for Video on Demand. This, in no way, is meant to say that the service is lacking. It is a great one. this is reviewing the movie.In the city, strange things are taking place. At first it seems like nothing more than some shadow play and a bit of urban migration, but that turns to panick as the numbers go up. Overnight, people literally leave their homes and vanish, taking nothing. As the mystery here deepens, so too do the reasons to why this is taking place.When I first saw this advertised in the pages fof Fangoria, I was immediately shopping for a venue to watch it. That was a couple of weeks ago and I should have written a review then, perhaps saving some people money. I apologize for that but I normally do not do the negative route. Still, this is a terrible way to fleece peolple with a good idea and terrible execution.What you have here is a tale of two proverbial cities, with one going off greatly in the storyline department and then taking a sudden turn and going down boring Street. I know - I have been there before and recognized the signs. I watched it with two other people as well, and they concurred. A lot of things went wrong and made this awful.You start with people going away in a weird way and people asking why. The main actors hang in there through this, and it all seems good. Then you have some of the scenes that try to keep people out of the shadows, some that made it seem as though the world is really hard to understand, and even when the vanishings start to make sense it hurts to watch it progress. The writers are at fault in a lot of this, and the direction hurts as well. What you have is an "" o no, avoid that shadow"" story mingling with a really boring output from the actors. Overacting is a theme as well as trying to make you scared of the nothing that is really not menacing, and it gets old fast. Really fast.I wish I could say something better but, in the end, I don't know how. What I do know is that you should not et this and, for 10 bucks, you should heed all the warnings out there.

But I do think it would be much better if the singing actually sounded good and matched what the actors were saying, instead of it being so obvious it's a track. Something about the way it was made looks amateurish -- definitely the least professional looking of the five pilots I've watched today. That said, I got some genuine laughs out of Dustin Ingram's performance, and I think the other actors could do better with more to work with, since a pilot is essentially just introductions. Even though I'm not crazy about the songs, I think this show could be campy fun with a few improvements.

It's like the &#34;fracking&#34; of Galactica (only that was easier to take).The subject matter is dark, but not &#34;over the top&#34; for a series made for adults. It would be a show you could sit down and discuss with the 15+ crowd (might want to skip a sex scene or two, but they haven't been egregious) as a study in &#34;gray&#34; morality...but again...the cursing puts me off.

I just yawned the entire time, this is exactly what the media is trying to brain wash people into being nowadays; mindless, self entitled, unambitious dumb heads who will chase the first trend they see.Ugh, I couldn't even finish it skip this mediocre stupid movie and watch something else more meaningful.

3.0,"This is the movie where I found out Johnny Cash was not the original man in black. It was Solomon Kane. And he's really black. Except where he's exceptionally pale, because, it's like medieval England and, well, we all know about the weather in England. It's never sunny. I never really ""got"" this movie. So, here's this guy who used to be bad, but turns good, but not because he wants to, but has to because of true love. He never really falls for the chick too hard, which is a surprise to me. I mean, if she's the reason he's keeping on, shouldn't he, like, show her? Instead, he is, THE MAN IN BLACK. And the fight scenes. If the movie were to showcase his badassery, I don't think they did a fantastic job. He, cuts, he slices, he dices, but he, to my my taste, didn't do so with panache, with infinite style, with a certain Bondian charm. People die, sure, but, The man in black works at it, so it's not really justice served with a side of immortal reason, it's more justice served with a bunch of grunting and farting, if you will. Samurai pictures show swordsmanship that is truly spectacular, ten people die with three strokes. That's amazing. I suppose the fighting in the man in black is more ""realistic,"" but, in a movie where all manner of flying beasts and demons appear, is ""reality"" really a major point?",1347840000,2012-09-17

Joseph, who is a film-maker decides to venture out to discover on his own if America has in fact lost the sense of community during tough economic times. He leaves everything behind to see if he could survive off the goodwill of America's new town square, Craigslist. He needs to discover if America has changed, and if it's now every man for himself, which at one time was not. Even though America is known to be wealthy, has the economy changed the community? Joseph also cuts himself off from everyone he knows, prior to embarking on this adventure. He decides to live off Craigslist, the new town square, for 31 days and nights.

5.0,We Binged watched this whole series from year 1 through year 4.5. Really loved the writing and the actors. Almost addictive and just wish it had managed to keep going a few more years...as into at least 7 full years. But it is what it was and that was very very good the whole show went out on top and in good standing. But like a good book when it's over it's over. Onto find something else. We don't get cable/satelite so rely on the DVD's and great reviewers from fans here on Amazon to figure out what we might like and enjoy. Someone reviewing The Closer mentioned this show and so glad I took their suggestion up. I can't recommend one season over the other as they were all just great and pretty much as good across the board. It was a bit disconcerning when the younger females kept going through pregnancies and their figures changed considerably but the show handled it well and really todays world they pretty much go with the flow and except for some creative shots and clothing aimed not to point it out they do pretty good.

3.0,"This pains me, since there is something within this film that is so amazing I feel it needs to be regarded as such, but three stars, while not awful, is certainly telling to the quality of this film as a whole.Does that make sense?First, the movie.  The film follows the true story (as much can be true in a film `inspired' by real events) of David Marks, a troubled young man looking for ways to rebel against a family that controls his every move (subconsciously, which is the best way).  When David meets and falls for Katie, it seems as though his life may start to iron out.  He walks away from his father `real estate' clutches and ventures off into a life all his own with Katie, but darkness erodes all happiness when David allows his father's manipulations to reel him back to New York, back into life in the Marks' family.  All tumbles downhill, rather rapidly, when familial tendencies begin to separate David and Katie until, one day, Katie disappears.For me, it is this point of the film where things start to just derail.  I understand the whole `inspired by real events' angle, and so I encourage even the bizarre, but the `made for TV' way in which the films later scenes are shot take away from the terror one should feel and actually gives this film a `Lifetime' movie feeling.The film does a 180, from decently engrossing thriller to complete disaster.So, this leaves one thing to be discussed...the very reason for which the films first half is so stellar; Kirsten Dunst.  I recently wrote an entry for my blog about the amazingness that was Kirsten Dunst in this film, and so I'm just going to quote that here (slightly doctored to reflect this review and not the article I initially wrote).""Then we have Kirsten Dunst, who just marvels with all sorts of layered emotional relevance in `All Good Things'.  Talk about a brilliant performance in a really bad film.  Kirsten plays Katie Marks, a real person (come on Oscar, why aren't you biting) who disappeared, `allegedly' at the hands of her deranged husband.  The one thing that Dunst's character, and performance, has (in spades) is serious emotional collapse.  One blogger mentioned that you could see Kirsten visibly age as she uncovers the truth about her husband.  I totally concur with this explanation of her devastatingly real performance.  As she slowly uncovers realities surrounding the family she's married into, you can see a hollowness erode her beautiful features.  She remains human despite the dramatic overtones (she never resorts to Hollywood's overtly obvious understanding of melodramatic `emoting') and delivers a quietly natural performance.  When she does unleash her suffering, it is with haunting desperation.  She completely collapses within her character's knowledge.  It's just a shame the film collapses the moment she leaves it.""Yeah, that pretty much sums it all up.  She acts circles around the rest of the cast, including Ryan Gosling, who suffers from poor character development (the script seems to skeletal when all is said and done) and really bad makeup.  I wish I could say skip the film, but you need to at least watch the films first half.  The moment Dunst leaves the scene though, you can take your exit as well.  The film just can't recover from such a tragic loss.",1296604800,2011-02-02
5.0,"This is an enjoyable Psych episode that pretty much follows the show's normal format of flashbacks and improbable coincidental occurrences, and it works well. We like Psych and tend to watch the older episodes on Netflix over theRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player, but this episode wouldn't stream so we bought it on Amazon since it was the next in the series.No spoilers from me: This is a Christmas themed episode that has Gus and Shawn going to Christmas dinner at Gus' parents house where Shawn tries to impress Mr. and Mrs. Guster, but things don't go too well when a neighbor is found murdered.Sometimes the acting is a little over the top and often boarders on downright silly, but it is a very clever and fun show.Highly Recommended!CFH",1320192000,2011-11-02
4.0,"I suspect this season might have been even more exciting and engaging than the first had the writers' strike not cut it short.  Since it doesn't have to introduce the characters, premise, or plot, the creative team could tell a straight-ahead story that never stops accelerating right up through its final moments.  But as the ""alternate ending"" demonstrates, they drew up short just as they hit a new creative flowering.Last season's survivors struggle to gather their lives and move forward--no small task when you've saved the world but can't take the credit.  Scattered from Japan to Ireland and from the present to the medieval past, they orbit each other, struggling to unknot the conspiracy that binds them together.  But when old secrets come back to the fore, the heroes must face a new enemy: their own collective guilt.If I had to find fault with this season, it's the needless introduction of new characters who complicate the narrative arc.  This season has so many characters that some of them disappear for two or three episodes, and we sometimes don't notice.  Like the X-Men comics of the 1990s, when Xavier's mansion housed a strange, expanding army, it becomes difficult for the audience to keep all the angles in mind.But for all that, it remains a tightly structured and propulsive story.  It makes good use of popular science fictional standards in a new and inventive way, and it plays interesting characters with complex needs off each other faster than the speed of light.  I wish they'd had the chance to explore the bold options they wrote for themselves, but it stands as a worthy successor to the first season.",1296259200,2011-01-29

5.0,"The audience is polarized in response to this astonishingly refreshing and brilliant little film: some are completely disgusted with the theme of `aberrant love' while other are awash in the courageous work by director Anne Fontaine, Fontaine and Christopher Hampton's adaptation of Doris Lessing's short story `The Grandmothers', and the acting by two of our finest actresses on the screen. Knowing that it is both loved and hated depending on the degree of appreciation for experimental film should be the driving force as to whether or not to take advantage witnessing this brave new film.In New South Wales, Roz (Robin Wright), her husband Harold (Ben Mendelsohn) and their son Tom (James Frecheville) live near the beach. Lil, (Naomi Watts) who is a widow, lives nearby with her son Ian (Xavier Samuel). Roz and Lil are best friends, and so are Tom and Ian. Harold applies for and is offered a job in Sydney without telling Roz. He expects Roz to move to Sydney with him, however, she hesitates.  After a night of drinking quite unexpectedly on the surface Ian and Roz start a sexual relationship. Tom discovers this and takes revenge by initiating a sexual relationship with Lil. Now Roz has even more reason to stay, and later Roz and Harold divorce. Two years of these two mothers/best friend's sons affairs pass but not without the inference that Roz and Lil are lesbians  - a way for Lil to avoid the approach of a suitor Saul (Gary Sweet). Harold returns from Sydney and his new highly enviable job in the theater department and discovers the affairs and summarily absents himself from the situation and from Roz. There are hesitations, but these do not last long and the secret relationships continue. Eventually Tom goes to Sydney for a promising job interview in the theater. His visit to Sydney changes everything for four of them - the nasty truth has its way to come out and alter everybody's happy lives. The rest of the film is a rapidly moving progression of changing affinities and eventual strange resolutions.The nuanced performances by Robin Wright and Naomi Watts are brilliant and very equally balanced with the sensuous and realistic portrayals By Xavier Samuel and James Frecheville. The chemistry is extraordinary and credible and makes what could have been a strained story work meticulously well. The cinematography by Christophe Beaucarne and the musical score by Christopher Gordon enhance the liquid flow of this stunning film. The story and the film itself require an emotionally mature audience able to accept variations on the themes of love and lust, but given there are mores to overcome, this is a brilliant art piece.

Seriously who would NOT want to go out for a beer with jackson, Opie, Chips, Scotty, Juice or Bobby Elvis?? Clay is another matter. Then there is the comparative morality of corrupt politicians, cynical, venal government agencies and morally compromised businessmen. So they get into all of these wild escapades, nothing is ever what it seems and the SOA is always about 15 minutes from death, destruction and prison as one scheme after another backfires. Someone should make a reel of the many ""oh s***"" moments in the series, whenever someone says it, it has already hit the fan. But it is never boring.

4.0,"Because this tale comes from History Channel, I went into this show expecting something more about history and less about a fictional tale.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this show.  It was extremely entertaining and touched on religion in so many ways.  It highlighted the ways religion has inspired violence and unfairness for example.  It also focused on Viking culture, which was interesting on its own. I believe some of the culture is left out or exaggerated in some way.  I'm not a history buff, though.At the end of season 1, I just wanted to see season 2.  There was a cliffhanger ending.

3.0,"This was a nice idea for a short film. Its a strange parody of a horror film complete with breaking the fourth wall. Its really about breaking the rules of story and film in general. A tire comes to life out in the desert, comes to town and kills a bunch of people. The acting is generally good. The ""bits"" as written are well done. But the whole thing is way, way padded out. The idea just doesn't have enough in it to carry the whole film alone. And the filler between the good bits gets real boring fast.They either needed to cut it down to 20 minutes or add something major to the story. The laughs just don't come fast enough and the good bits they do are quite obviously spread far apart. Some people will like it in its current length. Its arty and cute at 80 minutes. But those outside the European art house crowd are going to notice how the story drags really quick. And putting space between absurdist gags tends to undermine them.Quentin Dupieux displays considerable talent in doing short films. He previous did the French film ""steak"" which was similarly absurdist. But he needs to get beyond writing a series of bits and gags. He needs to learn how to pace out a full length film and how to put together a long form story. Or else he should stick to shorter films.Its not perfect. But its creative, well crafted with good writing and good acting. In spite of its flaws, its absolutely worth seeing. Though best viewed with the fast forward button ready to go at all times.",1307404800,2011-06-07

5.0,"This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone"" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.",1234310400,2009-02-11
5.0,"After her husband's death, Amanda Vaughn is emotionally and financially drained because of her husband's actions, therefore she packs her bags, what the IRS didn't claim, and along with her two teenage kids, heads back home to Highland Park, Texas to live with her mother, Elizabeth ""Gigi"" Stopper.During high school Amanda wasn't exactly the nicest person as she made her peers' lives a living hell. Now that Amanda is back in her home town, she is looking for a new start, but four of her ex-high school (Carlene Clockburn, Sharon Peacham, and Cricket Caruth-Reilly, and Heather Cruz) peers have a grudge to settle with her as they plan on making her life miserable.I was little skeptical of GCB, but I was a fan of Kristin Chenoweth and there was nothing else to watch after Desperate Housewives. The first episode was a little rocky, but after viewing a couple more episodes, I started to enjoy the quirkiness of all the characters. I especially liked Gigi, played by Annie Potts, as she pursued Carlen's uncle, Burl, played by Bruce Boxleitner. I rolled my eyes over the backlash of the title as people were judging before they actually watched an episode. I am Christian and I never once was offended. Thanks to a lousy 9:00 PM Central timeslot, GCB didn't get a chance to expose itself to more viewers. Despite its cleverly written scripts and great acting, ABC wrongly cancelled GCB where it could have done great in the fall taking over Housewives' old timeslot.",1339718400,2012-06-15

5.0,"This is a show I really can't get enough of.  I wish the seasons were 20+ episodes instead of just thirteen, but I guess the quality might suffer with more quantity, so I'll find a way to be content.  It isn't that difficult with a show this unique and magnificent.  More than anything, the acting keeps me coming back to this show.  On the small screen, it's unusual to have as many lead actors who are as superb as what Hannibal boasts.  It's a strikingly cinematic show for TV, especially a major network.  Mads Mikkelsen, Hugh Dancy, Lawrence Fishburne, and Caroline Dhavernas (Alana Bloom) are all fascinating, giving as much to their characters and this show as any Oscar winner has to their best movies.  Of course, Fishburne has had a prolific film career, but this show is some of his best work.In Season 2, the show continues its propensity for truly shocking plot twists and deliberate viewer manipulation.  It often convinces you that you know what's going on, only to have your understanding violently dashed before your eyes.  So, add top-notch writing to the excellent acting.  Top off this gourmet offering with the consistently stunning visuals, and you have a masterpiece of a show.  No  other TV show matches Hannibal's ability to make the sick and disturbing look elegant and beautiful.  It makes you feel like being submerged in Hannibal Lecter's warped emotions and worldview, finding an artistic aesthetic in death.After the unpredictable turn of events throughout this season, it's pointless to speculate on where the show will go in Season 3, but it at least seems to be wading deeper into the &#8220;Red Dragon&#8221; novel, and setting up future adaptations of the other books in the series.  I'll be anxiously awaiting the show's return in 2015.  A+, five stars, two thumbs up, highly recommended, etc., etc.",1404259200,2014-07-02

5.0,"&#34;Sometimes you just have to hold on to whatever you can.&#34; Nolan Hayes (Walker) and his wife Abigail (Rodriguez) are rushed to the hospital with pregnancy complications. Nolan is told he has a new baby girl who is having breathing problems and that his wife didn't make it. While he is trying to process this information the hospital begins to show signs of stress and panic. The doctor tells Nolan that his daughter must stay on the breathing machine for 48 hours, just when Nolan thinks he has had all he can take Hurricane Katrina hits. Before I started this my thought was, another Paul Walker movie...how can he do this without a car? Almost immediately I was sucked into the movie and didn't turn away until the end. This was not over-the-top or really that unbelievable and even though things kept getting worse I never once felt that they went too far. The movie stayed fast paced and tense the entire time and it was hard to look away from. The only problem I had with the movie (keep in mind I'm not 100% sure if this happened or not) was that almost instantly it seemed like New Orleans turned into something out of Mad Max, gunmen showing up and foraging for food and thinking killing is all of a sudden legal. Except for that aspect, which is only a small part, the movie was great and this is easily Paul Walkers best work. It makes me wonder if he wasn't in the crash if he would have made more of this type of movie or stay with &#34;I have car, I go fast&#34; movies. Overall, if you liked The Impossible you will love this one. A great movie to memorialize Walker with. If I was him this is the one I would want to be remembered for.

5.0,"For Series 6 LWT (London Weekend Television) ran out of short stories and reverted back to the two hour format used in season 4, drawing stories from the longer Poirot Novels. (Series 5 used the Short Stories.)This would be the last series for LWT to produce Poirot.  Granada Television would do a hostile take over of LWT and the Poirot series would go on hiatus until the A&E; Network would pick it up in 2000.Technically this would not be a real broadcast season as it was spread out over three years. It is just the last of the LWT productions.The classic two hour mysteries are:42  6-01  01/January/95  ""HERCULE POIROT'S CHRISTMAS""43  6-02  12/February/95  ""HICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK""44  6-03  11/February/96  ""MURDER ON THE LINKS""45  6-04  16/March/97  ""DUMB WITNESS""Even though these were filmed in 16mm, re-mastering them in Hi-Definition from the original 16mm camera films will produce a sharper image than the old 1995/1997 standard definition transfers made from 16mm copies, created from 16mm dupe negatives.Now if only A&E; would re-master their series 7, 8, 9, &10 from the original films, UNCUT.

3.0,The trailer for this movie shows the best parts. While the movie isn't bad it never lives up to it's potential. Very little action and slow moving.

3.0,"""Hounddog"" is a fairly predictable period piece about a young girl growing up in the rural south in the 1950's.  Dakota Fanning is impressive as a 12-year-old obsessed with Elvis Presley, and the supporting cast (David Morse as her womanizing father, Robin Wright Penn as her would-be mother, and Piper Laurie as her tipsy grandmother) is fine as well.  I'm not sure what all the fuss was about - there's nothing particularly controversial about this film.  Yes, there's a rape scene - but nothing shown in this film couldn't be shown on network television during prime-time.  Compare this to the harrowing (and deservedly controversial) ""Bastard out of Carolina"" and you'll see what I mean - both films are set in the same time period, with similar characters and circumstances.  But while ""Hounddog"" offers up clich&eacute;s as answers, ""Bastard"" forces its audience to confront the realities of poverty, child abuse, and rape.The problem with ""Hounddog"" isn't that it stretches the boundaries of morality and good taste - it's that the film itself is so derivative.  It feels like an odd mix of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" and ""Carrie"" - lots of nice scenes of dirt-poor kids bonding in swimming holes and corn fields with a little holy-roller craziness thrown in for good measure (Piper Laurie's character seems cut from the same cloth as her role as Sissy Spacek's mother in ""Carrie"").  This is a pretty film, with lovely country vistas and a nice hazy nostalgic quality that can be captivating on its own.  But there's nothing new here - just about everything that happens is predictable, including the final scene.  And all the snake symbolism is way, way overdone (I get it, I get it - ""stay out of the tall grass"").This is not a bad film, and it is worth seeing.  It is not, however, worth getting worked up over.  If you don't like ""Hounddog"" it won't be because it sexually exploits children.  It does not.  It just tries to present a picture of what it would be like to grow up poor and alone in a world that doesn't offer much support.  This movie is not about sex; it's about loneliness.  And on that level it's effective.",1298332800,2011-02-22

5.0,"Loved looking at, and hearing ""Alyssa Milano"" since the very first ""CHARMED"" episode. So, once this flick began with her name and face showing up, it was going to be a bearable agony if the story-line was not pleasing. Surprise! Actually, the only difficult part was that I wasn't her character's love interest.Easily a warming, while mildly complex romantic melodrama well filmed; crystal clear, good sound, with a theme that is ages old [boy meets girl, girl meets boys] including a tryst and a twist that places ""MY GIRLFRIEND'S BOYFRIEND"" in a category with the Olde Days' movies that ""Katherine Hepburn"", ""Spencer Tracy"", ""Cary Grant"" and ""Lauren Bacall"" made.Putting aside my personal desires, ""Alyssa Milano"" provides a much broader look into her talents and craft, tossing aside that playful youthful persona when necessary, allowing the Viewer to see the more adult maturity that is probably closer in actual realistic proximity to her physical nature. I'm not very big on Love Stories, but this is a nice one---easy on the eyes, brain and heart...  ---GBJ",1316390400,2011-09-19

2.0,"For a film with so much buzz, especially for its director and his bag of tricks, `Monsters' is disturbingly ineffective.  I should have listened to my Ammy buddy MKIA, but then again, even he said I may like this.  I wanted to.  While heavily clich&eacute;d, I just wanted this to scare the pants off of me, and we all know that atmosphere is the scariest thing of all; and this film supposedly had a lot of that.It doesn't.Okay, so the film takes place at a time when alien life forms are terrorizing humans.  These gigantic squid like things have been contained in Mexico by a gigantic wall that runs along the Mexican border.  A young photographer is in Mexico chasing after his big break when his plans are derailed by a sudden attack and the need to escort a young woman back to the States (that young woman happens to be the daughter of the photographer's boss).  Their journey back to the States is littered with oddly placed emotional connections and a few scattered attempts to scare us with brief glimpses of alien creatures.Take away the fact that this monster film hardly showcases the actual monsters; the film itself had major promise.  I mean, I'm all for a film about emotional growth and human bonding in the times of trial.  The script itself, while heavily clich&eacute;d, could have really proven deeply arresting, and the final scene is expertly handled (and by final scene I mean just that; the split second before the credits begin to roll).  Still, there are two things that really prohibited this movie from being any good; Scoot McNairy and Whitney Able.  These two actors are atrocious.  I mean, they probably put in the worst performances of the year; period.  There is no chemistry, and the dialog they have to suffer through is horrendous.  I know that this film was done on a small budget, which actually says a lot for the crispness of the scenes (the cinematography is especially marvelous) but you can feel an air of `cheapness' in a lot of the voice over work (I don't know if the sound wasn't good on the original shoot and so they basically dubbed all the dialog, but there are many scenes where the crispness of the vocals is distracting and phony sounding).The `scary' moments are few and far in between, but they are effective to a degree.  The opening scene is pretty great and got my hopes up very high, but in the end `Monsters' barely registers with the viewer save for some beautiful cinematic shots and a shivery score.",1306195200,2011-05-24

4.0,"This is a Japanese gangsta flick from the directorial hand of Takeshi Kitano. It is a full throttle story of the Yakuza and the various families (or crime syndicates) that control the Kanto region. It is full of intrigue and double plotting but the one thing that runs as a vein throughout this film is violence. Good old fashioned, medieval, nasty violence.The Uber crime Lord is called Mr Chairman and actually does dress like some despotic ruler of a `democratic republic' like say North Korea. Even his servants wear the same white tracksuits - even when they are serving dinner, I think you will find that Debretts classes that as a massive faux pas, but hey these are Japanese Mafiosi types and so probably aren't well read.He discovers that two of his under lords have made some sort of pact to be `sworn brothers'  whilst both serving time in one of Japans 1 star detention facilities. This he does not like and so demands that a sort of insult be done to prove that not all brothers do get along. Well one thing leads to another and as face is lost, and a few other bits - like fingers-, the retaliations ramp up. The land and powere grabs all come at a price and the fortunes of each change with the rapidity of a guns magazine being emptied.This is acted, directed and filmed in a stylish and no holds barred way. It just roars along, and keeps the shocks coming. There are some well inventive ways of dealing with your enemies and some brutal violence that made me squirm. The Japanese codes of honour and rampant disrespect to your underlings are heavily in evidence. This is just naked greed meets unfettered ambition in a tsunami of double crosses and violence and I thought it was excellent.This is not one for the squeamish but all lovers of extreme Asian cinema will find a place for this in their collections. In Japanese with a smidgin of English, this is not that short a film but just flew by for me - highly recommended.",1328832000,2012-02-10
5.0,"In this drama about the world of the CIA, NSA and others of that ilk it is refreshing to find that thinking, connecting one bit of evidence to another and analysis are given precedence over skull bashing, car chasing and mayhem.

It is a pity that there are only two seasons of it.",1379116800,2013-09-14

5.0,"I feel as if this second season has gone in a direction that is detrimental over-all.  By introducing new characters (Kate Moretti's soon-to-be-maybe ex husband and the REAL Doctor Natalie Vincent), It has taken the focus off the core of what made this series awesome the first season.Strong points from the first season:a PARTNERSHIP between Agent Moretti and Pierce. The Imaginary Natalie was also a great member of the plot as she often provided insight into his subconscious feelings.The &#34;ghost of the day&#34; aka his psychotic hallucinations manifested as the victim to provide clues as to the nature of the crime. AWESOME.His class monologues - Priceless.Second season has effectively added more characters, more confusion, more side-issues and has basically taken attention away from the core of what the show is about. The more side-drama you add the less you can focus on the core show: a disturbed man with a condition fighting to use his great mind to help society, and his struggles to maintain relationships to the people most important to him.",1373760000,2013-07-14

3.0,"This movie is the example of why you should have a strong outline plot, it's seems pasted together to a degree. However the editor managed to actually come up with a story here. Giant creatures that look like  walking octopusses! are taking over parts of mexico and two people must travel through the infected zone to get back to the United States. That's the story although it was the editor and director who finally figured this out I guess. The effects look great though! Which shows even a low budget movie these days CAN look fantastic unlike the low budget movies of yesteryear who had no cgi effects. THat being said I am sure many people were not happy that the movie is all taking place in jungle territory and northern mexico is all desert and mountains! The movie was shot in Guatelmala which is all jungle. Ok, the acting is fine and these days you can make a fine movie with limited equipment. No giant screens to block sunlight and such but still having no script and no idea what you want is not the best way to make a movie. This however turned out to be a an ok low budget movie with really good special effects. Like I said ten years ago the effects at this budget would have been at a far different level.  The blu ray looks great and you get lots of extras too.  So I would say that if you rent this one you'll be happy enough with it. I think the one star reviewers would probably hate all the really old sci fi movies out there so ignore em.",1309478400,2011-07-01
4.0,"I just finished watching the third season DVD set, and while Stargate Atlantis is still my favorite Sci-Fi show, I was rather disapointed.Here's why.(Warning!  Spoilers below!)First, story arc failure. I was expecting a huge advancement in the story arc concerning the Wraith, but it just didn't happen.  Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn't seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I'm dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the ""weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other"".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode ""The Naked Time"" and wasn't it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of ""ancients"" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the ""ancients"" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn't an ""ancient"" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn't that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There's so much that could have been done with them that wasn't.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there's Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he's still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there's the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I haven't seen any of season four.  Here's hoping.",1194134400,2007-11-04

Needless to say, the series is well thought out and well played by all of it's actors. The actor who play's Hannibal Lector is brilliant in the part. No Anthony Hopkins, (he will always be the best Hannibal to me), but brilliant non the less. This actor has made the part his own. I highly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of the Hannibal Lector series. Having seen all things Hannibal I can honestly say this is a phenomenal step is helping to understand the Hannibal Lector character and who he is. The actor who play's Will Graham does the part justice and lacks for nothing as the character. If you are a Hannibal Lector fan, this is for you.Ralph J. Fitcher",1396137600,2014-03-30

5.0,"Okay ... when I had cable, I fixed it so my remote would NOT land on MTV.  I was sick of the creeps from New Jersey and the trashy pregnant teens or anyone turning 16.  This show was available for Free on Amazon Prime.  Who doesn't remember the awkward high school teenage years?  (I see you ... raise your hand)The very first show had the star female lead giving it up to the popular high school jock.  Awkward.  Eeuww.  It was a little creepy seeing the actor doing a pretty good job of being, let's say ... &#34;high schoolish&#34; -- eeuw.  BUT all that teenage activity comes with serious things to ponder for those in the teen group and the story ends with good angst-filled messages of being true to yourself, standing firm, and maybe not giving it up so easily.For the rest of us sophisticated, suave and not awkward adults -- you will enjoy the kooky and loveable adults on this show.  Hard to believe we've got a Mouseketeer from the Cristina/Britney/Justin era playing a mom to a teenager.  The high school counselor is a wacky, loveable, character.  The teen girl lead has a hunky, adoring and adorable dad.I was surprised that I loved the show -- it is on MTV.Cute, show.  I hope they don't mess it up in the new season!Do you have Amazon Prime?

The characters were too cheesy for my taste--they were all very generic caricatures that lacked depth. Trite is the word I'm looking for. Additionally, the songs felt forced and were always jarring. The songs in a good musical should come naturally. These really didn't, in my opinion. I also didn't find the singing to be very good.Honestly, I had a hard time getting through the episode. I made sure to finish it, but I found it unpleasant. I know some people enjoyed it, though, so I must just not be the demographic it's targeted at. For me it was grating. Your mileage may vary.",1366502400,2013-04-21
4.0,"...however, I was pleasantly surprised. I rather enjoy the ""found footage"" genre, but the story lines appear to have been done to death. A documentary crew was filming in an abandoned insane asylum... Yawn... However, when I saw the trailer for ""Area 407,"" the first thing I thought was ""Hey! Not an abandoned asylum!"" The dinosaur in the trailer was a dead giveaway, but still, I held out hope that this wouldn't be, as I mentioned in my subject line, a ""Poor Man's 'Jurassic Park.'""Well, I can understand my fellow reviewers' frustrations, but I still liked ""Area 407."" It definitely wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, and for a ScyFy (sp?) flick it wasn't bad. The Charlie character was indeed, as one reviewer put it, a caricature, the typical obnoxious air traveler who paid good money to fly, so damn it, ""I want a drink."" And one of the main characters, the young Trish, was adorable as can be but quickly became extremely annoying. Still, there was some character development. And I was rather surprised to see the DeLaurentiis name on this film. (Any relation to Dino?)I bought the cheapest copy I could find in order to, uh, minimize the damage in case I ended up hating the movie. I'm happy to say, this was not the case.

5.0,"I think the show has moved a step up this season.  Annie has matured, as most people do once they are four years into a job.  The show is darker, however.  Some of the comic relief has disappeared, and the witty banter has decreased.The loss of the graphic laden, and somewhat cheesy, intro is a positive (though we miss the shots of Piper Perabo).  However, the loss of the theme song is lamented.  The song had little application (for those who could make out the words) to the early Annie.  Now, as she moves into a mature, and more compromising, phase of her career, the song makes sense.But the show still moves, and is even more engaging.  Hopefully, the Annie character will not lose the charm, but simply temper it as appropriate.  A great deal of her charm lies in her not diving down the rabbit hole as a person, but learning to compartmentalize.  She needs her sister back to provide the bungie that pulls her back out of the hole as needed.",1375833600,2013-08-07

At least I can skip through those on the disc.I blame FOX -- not Amazon. Amazon just distributes the content, but I don't think they control it ... The commercials are all FOX content embedded in FOX's streaming video content. Missing Archer episodes is a steep price, but I'm thinking it might actually be worth it.

The clinical white sets are a perfect canvass to the dark and genuinely creepy face of disease and deterioration of human flesh. It's here, you'll be reminded of David Cronenbergs early work i.e.: Videodrome, Scanners, The Brood and so on. The concept of an obsession with flesh as a metaphor for social and human issues is brilliant - and it's to this regard Brandon Cronenberg shows us the apple really does fall close to the tree.The pace unfortunately, is slow and the film drags. However the lead character Syd played by Caleb Landry Jones is a riveting, fearless performance. His deterioration is paced slow and so very methodically it's truly hard to watch yet impossible to turn away.The theme of obsessive fans isn't new. We've all seen both versions of ""The Fan"" ""Misery"" and so on. But Antiviral takes this obsession with fame to a new, maniacal level and despite it's problems it certainly does it well - and that's good movie making.I remember a blog entry by that late and never to be replaced Roger Ebert. His perspective on Americas obsession with fame was interesting. To paraphrase, his observation was that in countries ruled by royalty movie star and model obsession is nil to none. Yet in America Hollywood has become our true royalty and the obbsession with Fame and unbound adulation for those who are famous can be seen virtually everywhere.Ebert made an insightful point, if you followed his blog it's still live and worth the read.As for Antiviral I would have loved to know his take on it. To me it's a visceral, calculated expression of the need of obsessed fans to touch the face of fame at any price, inclding their own health and well being. In this case via being injected with dangerous viruses and pathogens from famous people who are sick.They sell their blood and the market is huge. Antiviral isn't a horror film or science fiction for that matter. You won't jump out of your seat or be frightened. If you have a fear of needles you'll cringe from time to time. Performances are stellar all around and there's a great cameo by the incomparable Malcolm McDowell which is almost worth the price of admission alone.Antiviral may have a an unfortunate slow pace however it's creepy enough to make you think. Far from perfect but the film does have a few moments of brilliance - as flawed as it may be Antiviral is well worth seeing.",1367539200,2013-05-03

5.0,"I was not really satisfied with the way that the judging went for this particular season--but it was so fun to watch!  I would have preferred for Mondo to win.  Although many of his designs were a bit over the top for my taste, he was who I considered to be the most talented.  My wife thought that Mondo's decision to include that white dress with the huge black polka dots in his final collection lost him him the support of Michael Kors, who had been critical of that design in the preliminary round.  But I liked that dress, so I felt that Mondo should have won.  As for the winner, Gretchen, I just did not like her designs.  It seemed like Heidi, though often critical of Gretchen, was always kind of pushing her along and supporting her come what may.  I think that Michael Kors really hit the nail on the head when he characterized Gretchen's designs as having a ""Lady of the Valley"" look.  These sort of loose beige/earthen-toned things were just not what I would consider elegant, sexy, or fun!  I also felt that April, the blond-haired younger woman, was not given enough credit.  I loved her wild black edgy designs.  Andy clearly deserved to be in the final three--I particularly loved his bathing suit in one of the challenges.  In the end I felt that the final three should have been Mondo, Andy, and April.Casanova, one of the real characters in the competition, was fun to watch.  I particularly remember his weird dress that looked like it was about to slip off the hips of the model--and earned a few amusing comments from Michael Kors--who likened it to something appropriate for a belly dancer or stripper.  Michael Costello was interesting as well.  The poor guy was really maligned in one of the earlier challenges--and accused of being unable to sew.  To his credit, Mondo worked very earnestly with Michael in a team challenge which did much to rehabilitate Michael's image.  Michael was wonderful at draping--but I agreed with the judges that he did not belong as one of the final three.  I think that Michael achieved some kind of record low in his reaction to not making the final three.  His nearly hysterical sobbing was embarrassing to watch!",1300492800,2011-03-19
5.0,"This movie is 43 minutes people. It you love movies esp sci-fi, you have sat through a lot worse for much longer :) It flows more like an episode than a completed movie and I would really like to see where this crew could go with a few million allotted to them; probably a great series or a strong box office movie.Most indie sci-fi nowadays has got to be really tough to do. You will not see much better indie in this genre. The scenes flow pretty smoothly, the Alien is totally believable and her look is very effective.

5.0,"There are several attributes that one should look for when landing on a favorite TV show and those are emotional value, dramatic value, action content and the kicker is the intelligence quotient, one has to make sure that all of these walk together hand in hand down a bumpy path to someplace,  dare I say it a &#34;clearing&#34;, or at least an understandable reckoning ELEMENTARY does just that and the sweetly bowlegged Lucy Liu impales us on her noetic poise of her rational rudder, she has the commendable attribute of being able to darn the holes in Sherlocks emotional socks.

2.0,"This is a seriously awesome concept. More Americans need to be aware of what life is like in Burma. Unfortunately, since extremely significant reforms have occurred in Burma, this film would no longer be nearly as powerful as it would have been 2-3 years ago. Aung San Suu Kyi's party has members who have been elected to parliament. She is no longer under house arrest.The film also suffers from extremely generic, stereotypical characters. I could have overlooked this and enjoyed the movie, if the message had still been wholly relevant. However, it isn't.I suppose that this movie could be reworked to take place in Tibet, or North Korea, or Chechnya... or Syria? But, I doubt it. No jungles. Different opposition organizations.

The genius conductor may be able to act it through, but the actor has not demonstrated a  strong enough persona with his supposed pedigree.

Sure, Season 4 may not have as much action as the others. But it makes the characters seem more human.

3.0,"Audiences have shown a benign fascination with films involving torture.  Online critics are quick to associate much of this to the SAW franchise - puzzle pictures all centered around a mysterious puppetmaster who puts his players through increasingly gruesome physical ordeals - but methinks it's probably gone on since legitimate splatter films built an audience throughout the 1970's and early 80's.  One things for certain: if you're no cringing or looking away, then you're possibly drawn into the relentless twists that produce harm, fractures, and bloodflow.  And, if that's your thing, you'd do well to pick up a copy of WOULD YOU RATHER.  It may not end up being more than a passing favorite, but you could do worse with 93 minutes, that's for sure.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Iris (played with curious detachment by Brittany Snow) finds herself desperate to make ends meet when she gives up her college career in order to care back home for her terminally ill brother.  Distraught further to learn that she's no match to his needed blood marrow transplant, she responds to a telephone call from his doctor with a great surprise: a millionaire philanthropist named Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) believes he may be able to offer the young woman an opportunity to see all of her prayers answered.  Lambrick asks Iris to join her at his estate for a dinner, where she and others will be appealing to the Lambrick Foundation.  The catch: only one of those in dire need can and will be helped.WOULD YOU RATHER begins much like it sounds, presenting the ultimate `what if' scenario to dinner guests all hoping for assistance.  They've all been told previously that, after their meal, they'll be taking part in a game to determine which of them will be the lucky winner, and, on that level, the film tries hard to appeal to even the audience's benevolence: clearly, this ""game"" can't be all that it's been made out to be, and these guests find themselves essentially in a sadist's version of `truth or dare' that more likely resembles `dare or dare.'  One by one, they're offered two choices - harm yourself or harm the person on your left (or right) - and, as much as writer Steffen Schlachtenhaufen and director David Guy Levy would have you believe they've crafted a game of wills, it's hardly that.  Simply put, it can't be a true game of wills when a player is forced to choose between two truly bad choices.The story tries to work toward some depth of individual convictions: where it fails is that we're only truly given Iris's background - in fact, we're shown what her life looks like with flashbacks featuring her and her brother - so the other guests at the table never become more than just other guests at the table.  There are hints to some of the obstacles they're possibly facing, but, as the narrative device gives viewers little chance to understand or identify them, they end up being nothing more than hapless victims slowly draining the life from one another.  Sure, there may be some nice ensemble chemistry, but, without any emotional attachment to these other players, it ends up feeling a bit flat.What does work is Combs' palpable menace.  He commands the screen whenever he's there - having followed his career since the 80's, I've always had some respect for his obvious theatricality.  It's nice to see him getting some material that, despite its weaknesses, truly gives him something to do.  As a character, one could argue he's far more interesting than even Ms. Snow (the obvious lead), but, again, a somewhat hackneyed script never produces much hint of substance as to what's made the nefarious Mr. Lambrick into the nefarious Mr. Lambrick.  Villains without motivation work only in thrillers, but they're soon lost to memory once it all fades to black.Lastly, there's a clever little twist brought up in the film's closing sequences.  From what little I've read (in other critiques), it appears to have generated a modest amount of controversy, some claiming it kinda/sorta negates the whole message inherent in what came before it (the twist).  I'd argue that that's far from the case; rather, I see it at instilling yet another lesson to those who ""play"" with life in the way that these fortunate and unfortunate dinner guests did.  It's far too precious to be reduced to a `what if.'  Too bad that's something the screenwriter missed when he conceived of all this.WOULD YOU RATHER (2012) is produced by Periscope Entertainment and Social Construct.  DVD distribution is being handled through MPI Media Group.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds very solid throughout.  As for the special features, there's an audio commentary track featuring the director and writer along with a poster gallery (???) and the theatrical trailer: it's a small collection, but it's there for those inclined to explore the subject matter further.RECOMMENDED.  If I can give you no better reason to see this indie killer/thriller, then it would be to watch the incomparable Jeffrey Combs as the undeniably demented Shepard Lambrick.  WOULD YOU RATHER go back and watch him in RE-ANIMATOR?  Or what of his spectacularly nuanced work as Weyoun the Vorta on STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE?  Or how about his wonderful turn on USA Network's THE 4400?  He's a master of his craft, and, if anything, WOULD YOU RATHER gives him some appropriate scenery to chew as a sadist with a mission: to play a game with the lives of the players truly in the balance.  He's the ultimate `dungeon master' in this contemporary spin on THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME - the ringleader in the most bizarre circus you'll ever see.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Films provided me with a DVD copy of WOULD YOU RATHER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1373846400,2013-07-15
1.0,"My big problem with this film is that it simply does not flow. It's like a composition that meanders all over the place and does not fully explore any thesis. Characters do things which one simply wouldn't do in real life. If I was a graduate student at Oxford, I surely wouldn't drop the ""F"" bomb on a Don whom I want to become my mentor. Romantic relationships appear ""out of the blue."" Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time. It's a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at, but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly, other than her looks, Ms. Watling doesn't impress much either.

He is raw, and no topic is off limits. He will test you. Chris Rock talks about religion, handicap people, race, goes off on white and african american people, and all races in between.  He talks about woman and men.  Well Tosh is the same only he does it differently. Nothing is off bounds with him. On his show or his stand up routine. His show is original the fact it is the highest rated show on comedy central for a reason. He does great innovations like web redemption's for those who want to come to his show and re do the stupid stuff they did and try to get it right but in a funny bit that Tosh put together. He is makes fun of himself better and more than any other comedian.  He is just one of the funniest people on the planet.  You have to be able to handle any subject.

5.0,"This show often hires absolutely wonderful talent to guest star and this episode showcased this aspect by hiring Patricia Arquette.  We open with her looking like a middle aged woman going to daily mass and she looks well into her forties. Shortly thereafter she transforms herself into a street prostitute and you would never know it is the same person. Her importance to the episode is that she is the person a killer on the rampage in the city keeps calling and trying to meet. SVU needs to keep on her night and day to find this killer. Arquette essentially blows every other actor off the screen with this role.For those not familiar with Arquette, she was a leading film actress before turning to tv. She worked with most of the top directors and male stars.  She branched off into tv as she aged.  She starred in her own show MEDIUM for many seasons. She comes from a family of actors, including Roseanna Arquette and David Arquette.A year or so ago this show hired Ann-Margaret to guest star and she likewise put in a performance as an alcoholic which blew everyone else off the screen.  She won an Emmy for that guest star, which Patricia Arquette could easily do as well.

4.0,"I admit I've just started reading the series but so far Titus Welliver seems like a perfect fit.  If you look up his credits, he's been in almost everything.  Bit parts but always with an intensity. The episode was slow to start but, like a really good fire, it got hotter as it went along.  It's a slow burn.  By the end, I wanted the next episode right away.  Bosch has great potential.  I can't wait to see more!",1393372800,2014-02-26
5.0,Non-stop action and great special effects. Going into a prison was pure genius. We get a new character and all the returning characters are somewhat different from last season. Carl is a bad ass and Daryl is now second in command. Hersel aged quite a bit. Rick is no longer bonding with his wife and Carol is horny for Daryl. Glen and Maggie continue their romance. Can't wait until episode #2 - more new characters and more of the fabulous Prison set. Please do more with T-Dog. There is potential there and his role in the group has always been on the back burner.,1350345600,2012-10-16

3.0,I do enjoy the characters & their storylines. But the soap opera drama leads rather than weekly plots played out- I like the smaller investments rather than having to recall the character's history.

The show is very sit-com over-the-top-antics, but entertaining. I enjoyed the first episode; time will tell.I had to laugh at the clothes. ""I had that belt!!"" And the incomparable 80's music plays as much a character as the actors do themselves.",1382140800,2013-10-19

5.0,"- Korra, seriously sleepy and railing against her morning regimen: ""What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning?"" (voice drops to a whisper) ""The morning is eeeeevil.""So I'm not that familiar with the original cartoon show. When you mention AVATAR I think of giant blue aliens. And, to me, airbending is what you do when you've had too many spicy chimichangas. Except that I saw THE LEGEND OF KORRA on Nickelodeon and was impressed enough that I'm now incentivized to touch base with the source material.AVATAR:THE LAST AIRBENDER was oriented towards a wandering heroes theme, something which THE LEGEND OF KORRA eschews. Our protagonist has it over Avatar Aang by some years, and so I understand that, in comparison, the storytelling is darker and more ambitious. Some seventy years after Avatar Aang's turbulent era, here's Korra, an impulsive teenager, being projected as the next Avatar, except that Korra can only bend three of the four elements. Seeking mastery over that elusive fourth element, determined to learn airbending, she leaves her training outpost in the South Pole and journeys to Republic City to train under the stern airbending master, Tenzin, who happens to be Avatar Aang's youngest child, now grown to middle-age adulthood. Korra brings along her wicked awesome polar bear dog, Naga, who is so awesome I'm compelled to use the word ""awesome"" three times in a sentence.In Republic City Korra is initially regarded as a rube, a rustic, but she's adventurous and high-spirited and so confident. As her frustration at her inability to airbend grows, her notoriety as the Avatar exposes her to public scrutiny and to the twisty politics of Republic City. She becomes aware of the increasing anti-bending sentiment harbored by the non-bending populace. She finds solace in competing in the hotly contested pro-bending sports league. Imagine the hubbub when it's outed that the current incarnation of the Avatar is one-third of the Fire Ferrets. They've just qualified for the playoffs.Meanwhile, looming over everything is the malevolent presence of Amon, the shadowy figure that leads the anti-bending movement calling itself the Equalists. A non-bender (and proud of it), Amon uses his ability to strip away others' bending skills to inspire the Equalists and to foment a violent revolution. He wants to reshape the world. He sets his eyes on Korra. He's a fantastic villain, even if the show does play dirty pool with regards to his true identity.""Book One: Air"" presents this series' marvelous first twelve episodes. Week after week, these episodes keep on topping each other. I couldn't believe how good it was. I dig the backdrop, Eastern mysticism hand in hand with western innovation, a rich blend of the medieval and the progressive. Seventy years had elapsed from Aang's own series, enough time for the way of life to evolve from feudalism to something resembling industrial Shanghai circa 1920s. I love those touches, the vintage automobiles, that voice on the radio that just reminds you of the flapper era. The animation is so visually striking and gets only more dynamic when Korra and her friends spring into action. And, yes, Korra makes friends and, in fact, goes on to form an informal posse that engages in bouts of vigilante justice throughout Republic City.The action sequences are so boss and made even more epic by the presence of metal benders and blood benders and sinister chi-blockers, as well as the more traditional benders. I love that Korra fights with reckless abandon. I really like her character's arc, her growth as a person. I also became fond of Tenzin, Bo Lin, Asami Sato and the stoic Police Chief Lin Beifong. Seeing Beifong and Tenzin unleashed planted a big grin on my mug. That grin only got wider when Tenzin's adorable little kids get in on the act (that young boy is a riot).Did I even mention how funny this show is?Even if there were no more LEGEND OF KORRA episodes after this, I'm satisfied. This is an arc rich in plot development. It's constructed with a definite beginning, middle, and end in mind, and I can't recommend it enough. If there are any naysayers, it's those who demand even stronger ties between THE LEGEND OF KORRA and its predecessor, never mind that Easter eggs pepper the episodes. It's a good thing I don't have blood-bending talents. However, I'm down with those who say that the narrative could do without the cheesy teen romance bits. Mako kind of ticks me off. I can't wait for the next season, or is it the second half of Season One?The DVD set comes with 2 discs. The bonus stuff goes like so:- ""The Legend of Puppetbender Presents: The Making of a Legend: The Untold Story, Part I"" - spoofy interviews with a fake LEGEND OF KORRA cast... as puppets (00:06:00 minutes)- Audio Commentary by Creators, Cast & Crew on 4 episodes: ""Welcome to Republic City"" (with creators/exec. producers Mike Dimartino and Bryan Konietzko and Janet Varney who voices ""Korra""), ""A Leaf in the Wind"" (Dimartino, Konietzko, Janet Varney and David Faustino who voices ""Mako""), ""Skeletons in the Closet (Dimartino, Konietzko, and composers/sound designers Ben Wynn and Jeremy Zuckerman), and ""Endgame"" (Dimartino, Konietzko, co-exec. producer Joaquim Dos Santos and Steve Blum who voices ""Amon"")",1349568000,2012-10-07

Also, cranky people age faster: this is my scientific and medically sound theory). A few laugh lines are okay in exchange for general skin dewiness.

5.0,"After a week off, Dollhouse returned with ""Haunted,"" another wonderful, high-octane episode that brings a completely new dimension to the concept behind the series. This brings up even more ethical questions about the Dollhouse that I've never thought of before, and makes the viewer think a little bit harder about characters in the show.After Adelle's wealthy friend, Margaret, dies, she imprints the woman's memories into Echo allowing her, in a sense, to have a kind of life after death. Adelle and Echo/Margaret attend the woman's funeral, since she wonders just how many people actually loved her when she was alive. After some unexpected happenings at the funeral, Margaret decides that she wants to find out who killed her.Past this point the viewers are thrown into a surprising original twist on the age-old ""whodunnit"" murder mystery (complete with typical line-up of suspects, all this motives). I thought this was a fresh and much welcome departure from the rest of the series and allowed Dollhouse to add a little mystery into the mix. The entire plot was perfectly put together and filled with intense surprises that kept me guessing up until the very end.The story's unique approach also forces viewers to think a little harder about what kind of world they will leave behind after they die. Are their relationships and lives just as they imagine them to be, or are there some sinister secrets lurking underneath it all?Back at the Dollhouse, it's time for Topher annual ""diagnostic test."" The purpose behind this isn't really explained, but it results in Topher imprinting Sierra with a personality that makes her the perfect nerd-friend for him, complete with knowledge of MMORPGs, laser tag, Xbox 360 and science-y stuff. While these scenes are absolutely hilarious and feature great dialogue, they are serve as a kind of window into Topher's character -and just how lonely he is.Topher's not the only lonely one. Agent Bellard is feeling lonelier by the minute as he wrestles with the truth of Mellie's identity. As Bellard pushes closer to the Dollhouse, he makes a believer in the FBI office after the two try to investigate Mellie's past.In the end the mystery of Margaret's death comes to a satisfying conclusion, despite the unbelievable idea that Margaret willingly gives up her stay in Echo's body and potential eternal life. However, I can easily overlook this detail after the rest of ""Haunted"" kept me guessing the entire time.Sadly, there are strong rumors going around that Dollhouse is going to be canceled after the first season -just like Fox cancels all of its good shows. I've also read online that Fox will not air the final episode of the season, but Joss and co. are planning to include it on the DVD.",1240790400,2009-04-27

1.0,"No spoiler alert only because this movie makes absolutely no sense & what's worse, the acting (not actors) or their dialogue is hidious.  I'm in to the movie about 20 minutes and I'm regretting my selection and considering ending the (my) torture but no, I continue to watch hoping against all hope that it will improve but it doesn't.  In fact, it continues the descent into what I've only seen a handful of times in my life - oh the agony, the utter and complete pain.  Let this review be your WARNING: Go to your next selection - don't waste your time here.  The story sucks, the acting sucks worse and the ghosts are absurd, horrible.

1.0,I so wanted this to be good. This was not crazy enough to be satire and well just stupid. I love to look at Mark Consuelos. John Goodman is a dear.But this was an insult to latinos and southern white men. the lowest common denominator would have been funnier . I want the 30 minutes back. The clip at the end deserved a chuckle but even Corbet could not make this show deserve a laugh out loud. It could be so much better sharper more intelligent but it just is not.  It is obvious in it's  attempts of humor stereotypical and well watch a jon stewart or even Glen Beck another time for some laughs not this farse. Sorry Garry Trudeau you did not hit the nail close to the head.,1367452800,2013-05-02
4.0,"Well, as some reviews has already stated this is a show that isn't exactly uplifting, filled with unapologetic flawed characters and a few social/moral problems we face in today's society however it is entertaining as hell!The story explores the life long hardships of single moms but it's filled with sarcasm that it might be seen as offensive to some, especially those who can relate to it in real life. At first, it seems that the writers tangle a lot of contemporary issues ex; financial problems, alcoholism, promiscuity etc.. that a viewer cannot resist the urge to exclaim in protest. However, if you keep watching you'll grow to love the show and understand it's humour.Me personally, I loved how the writers made this show and the way it is presented. It is a social satire about very controversial sometimes depressing realities but it always tends to find a bright spot to everything. The characters are loveable Christie is good at her role but Bonnie is great! It's wonderful to find a strong female character who doesn't feel the need to whine and complain about her  being victimised every five seconds! Finally someone who owns up for their past. We need more people like those nowadays.But even if some situations like most sitcoms are overly exaggerated for the sake of ratings and what not. Mom is a show made with heart. I would love to recommend anyone to give it a shot, it's worth a try.",1395014400,2014-03-17

4.0,"Aliens! Come on, why else!! No, not the illegal one's! This series is about a possible lost history in human evolution and societal advancement that has been lost to the ages. Human history has a tendency to be reset every 10,000 years or so (my opinion), due to societal, or natural disasters. This is why I like it. it attempts to fill in the holes of a possible history with the question, ""what if?"" in not so many words.",1395014400,2014-03-17
5.0,"'Better Off Ted' is an excellent example of programs that don't develop a fan base until its too late. The writing and acting are excellent. Portia de Rossi is spot-on as the corporate suit with no empathy or moral compass, Jonathan Slavin and Malcolm Barrett are hilarious as the lab geeks with zero social skills, and Jay Harrington is perfect as the buffer between them.

3.0,"The main premise of this show appears to take the actor with the least screen time or interaction with the star and make them the guilty party. A 1970's novel style that quickly annoyed people by having them read several hundred pages before introducing the killer on the next to last page. The main character is likable and the relationship with the nurse is oft-times weird and disjointed, but the supporting cast makes up for the obvious flaws and inconsistencies that abound and annoy. I've been binge watching it and do find myself checking the time, playing Frost, or looking up baseball scores while it's on, so take it for what it's worth. I guess its better than network TV, but not by much.",1396396800,2014-04-02

I get it already. It gets to the point of, if you have to explain the joke, then it ain't funny.

He is befriended by a young nun and eventually pulls himself up out of the gutter to extract revenge on some who have killed his best friend. The movie has some of Statham's routine martial arts antics but you will sheer when employs them. This is a movie that will make you root for the flawed man and hope that he wins in the end. You will be surprised and see a role that you do not expect.,1379808000,2013-09-22
5.0,"This season is very good. The format changes allow better observing for each individual shooter and gives each shooter a chance to give their thoughts on their preformance, allowing fans to be more connected to an already familer cast. Also with the elimination of teams and nomination range, the negativity that occured in previous seasons is gone, espically demonstrated in how every marksmen reguardless of season/team/relation supported each other.The returning cast is surpisingly very well cast, with only one marksmen returning that didn't have much impact on his season. Most marksmen that proved themselves as good shooters in their season, proved that they still have it and most marksmen that either were more minor shooters or needed redemption got their shining moments. Every marksmen that made it to the finale deserved it and for once it wasn't a big deal as to who came out on top (a first since season 1). Also unlike other all star reality seasons I've seen, no one got worse and the season was very positive.That being said there are a couple of gripes. One, some fans will complain about the squad challenges, two History really shouldn't have included Brian's comment about Chris in episode 5 or 6, three I really hate the fact that History can't design the show so they can properly eliminate the spare marksmen (2 leave in one episode) however if you keep the new format then you can avoid that problem. Finally as with every reality all star season I've seen so far I feel the more deserving of the final two didn't win (however unlike the other ones I've seen, this winner winning didn't hurt the season in any way, and I do like the winner).Is this the best season of Top Shot? Honestly I just say this is its own season and it is awesome.",1377734400,2013-08-29

3.0,"I spent 5 seasons needing to keep notes on this well filmed, often well written, series- details presented one season seemed to return later on. I watched every episode of this final short season because of it's past quality, and mostly because of that. Based on a one off episode in 4th season I always had a feeling of incompleteness with this one.Season 4 ended with the Obervers writing Peter out of the timeline we were familiar with just as peace was achieved between the two universes. 5 starts with our guys preserved in Amber, the Observers having taken over decades ago and rattled on to a very unsatisfactory, sloppy ending.After Walter & the Observer boy traveled to the future origin point of the Observers, thus stopping their creation, time was reset- but only to the moment before the start of the invasion (if the Observers never existed then the reset would be to a time before the series ever started). So many threads left hanging I wonder if the producers had ideas for a full season but got funding cut off and had to cobble things together?

This is an obvious and overused method to simulate fights without having to choreograph the action or use stunt personnel. You can't for a moment suspend belief.This demonstrates how the show is organized. It's a certainty that even the smallest arguments are scripted. Simulated drama was unnecessary. Meaningful drama would have emerged with more filming and editing (i.e., a bigger production budget).These are all smart ladies. They are not glib like this in real life - the opposite. It's difficult for me to continue watching more than ten minutes at a time despite my liking each of the women.Nevertheless, there are redeeming aspects. The way the ladies talk probably couldn't be highly scripted. They talk like their fathers and uncles from the Outfit. They use old expressions that still capture meanings and convey not only street smarts but a little old world wisdom.Too bad the women are presented as high-maintenance brawlers. Unfortunately, what these women can tell us from their experiences has been caricatured.",1371427200,2013-06-17
4.0,"Since I haven't watched TV in over 5 years, I just keep an eye out for DVD's that sound interesting. Since the first season of Being Human was such a good buy, I bought it. The series was very enjoyable & I wasn't disappointed. I look forward to getting the next season (when it's a bit cheaper). I would be interested in seeing the UK version. It sounds like the first few episodes are the same in both series, but then maybe they each take off in their own direction. The UK version seems to have fewer episodes (per season) & is a little pricey. At any rate, as I previously stated, THIS version of Being Human was very enjoyable & I look forward to getting the next season. They could cut back on the amount of blood, however.",1358121600,2013-01-14

My mind was blown on the episode I watched last night.  Talking about how light travels at the same speed, no matter what it is on.  I never thought about that before.  Amazing show.

3.0,I found it to be OK but maybe because I've seen other young people in NY shows.  I guess it sure is different and that might make it on a streaming platform like Amazon.

Then, as the main character develops increasingly bizarre symptoms after her one-night stand with a mysterious stranger, the whole movie loses all credibility. No one around her seems to notice that she is beginning to look like a ... um.....zombie. She has weird blues lines all over her face and her eyes are full of blood, but the restaurant manager where she works insists that she come in and work anyway. Duh. And then the doctor she goes to completely doesn't note that she is looking like something from outerspace, not just someone with an STD. Oh well. And forget the ending. By then, it's become a comedy.",1395705600,2014-03-25
4.0,"Whether it's Jason, Freddy, or Michael Myers, you can't keep a good homicidal maniac down. Sooner or later, something new will pop up for die-hard fans and new generations to enjoy. The classic characters from the ""Psycho"" franchise are no different.The last entry in the ""Psycho"" series was released in 1998 and wasn't very well received. It's no wonder it took 15 years to revisit the Bates homestead. Granted, it wasn't a continuation of the original storyline started by Alfred Hitchcock in 1960. It was Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot remake starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche in the roles played by Anthony Hopkins and Janet Leigh. It's still the last we saw of Norman Bates, who many would consider the Granddaddy of Slasher anti-heroes.Just like the 1998 revision of ""Psycho,"" A & E's ""Bates Motel"" aims to re-tell the story of Norman Bates. This time it's from childhood and gives us insight into the events that pushed poor Norman over the edge. As each episode unfolds, we see that the signs were there from the beginning. Mother smothers her son in an attempt to protect him from himself and others. Norman deals with his anxieties and anger issues in unhealthy ways that will haunt him for the rest of his tragic life.""Bates Motel"" keeps audiences addicted as it moves from one depressing story arc to the next. It's as if the entire Bates family is destined from the beginning to suffer for some wrong they committed many years ago. For lack of a better way of putting it, theirs is a legacy of suffering, bad decisions, and bad luck. Everywhere they go, misery follows them.Vera Farmiga does a wonderful job as Norma Bates. She's at the same time conniving, vindictive, fragile, and sympathetic. Farmiga does a great job jumping from one extreme emotion to another. She also knows how to add humor to her portrayal of the character.Freddie Highmore is frighteningly great in the role of Norman Bates. You can see him growing into the tragic psychotic we all know and pity in the ""Psycho"" movies. He does a great job emulating some of the mannerisms Anthony Perkins' created for the character. Some might say Highmore plays crazy a little too good (Haha!).My only complaint with ""Bates Motel"" is the location move they did from Fairvale, California to White Pine Bay, Oregon. I'm not entirely sure what the writers and producers were thinking when they moved locales, but it just seems pointless and troublesome to me. The entire time I'm watching the show, I can't stop thinking about the unnecessary change.If ""Bates Motel"" was to have a rating, I would say it would be PG-13. There's nothing too graphic in it. However, it does contain grisly images, adult language, adult situations, and violence.""Bates Motel"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78: 1) and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 or Dolby Digital 2.0. The video is crisp, clean, and easy on the eyes. The surround sound does a fabulous job setting the viewer down in the middle of the disturbing world of Norman Bates.There are a couple interesting special features found in the ""Bates Motel"" Season One Blu-ray set. It contains deleted scenes. The Paley Center Panel Discussion with the cast and creative team is also included.""Bates Motel"" Season One is recommended for fans of television shows that blend the elements of thrillers and dramas with a nice helping of black humor. If you're a fan of the ""Psycho"" movies, don't be afraid. The show pays homage to the films and is very respectful of them. This collection contains all 10 episodes and runs around 7 hours and 15 minutes. You might want to block out a solid 7 hours before you even watch the first episode. Once you start watching it, you won't be able to stop.",1378944000,2013-09-12

5.0,"Stan Lee has alternately been reviled and revered for his contributions to the comic world. Now in his 90s, Stan Lee uses this documentary to be surprisingly frank about what happened, what didn't happen, and share his side of the story amidst rumors of bankruptcy, his failure to share credit with other creators, and his legacy as an author.Lee makes a point of emphasizing that he is a writer -- not a comic book artist -- which is noteworthy in itself.  Authors have slowly become more prominent in the world of comics, but it's easy to understand how fans have often conflated Lee's legacy as a ""creator"" with actually drawing the comic.  This has serious implications in determining who actually created Spider-Man and other iconic superheroes Lee helped invent -- it was almost always a group effort between the artist and author.  Whether or not Lee gave credit where credit is due is moot now -- he makes it clear, complete with signed letters, that he feels that the accolades should be shared.  Lee is one of the few creators still living, and thus is the beneficiary of the comic creator legacy simply by outliving his peers.In the early days it's clear the comic book industry was a haphazard affair, and Lee survived a series of turbulent changes due to his tenacity and charm.  He is dogged in producing ideas -- many of which, it's clear in his later years, weren't always good -- but he sells them with such affable charm that even his bad ideas are hard to resist.  In a nascent comic book industry, Lee threw everything at comics and used what stuck.Lee's most important contribution is likely his insistence that superheroes have normal, everyday problems.  In the world of grim-and-gritty Batman it's hard to imagine a world that isn't grounded in reality, but back when Lee entered the comic book industry Spider-Man's issues with his girlfriend and family were novel.  Lee's humanity -- shared in touching detail by his wife's travails with childbirth -- shaped the heroes we know today.It's also easy to see how Lee might overshadow other creators.  Like Gary Gygax of Dungeons & Dragons, Lee was a showman who loved his soapbox, and moved to Hollywood to continue the natural evolution of his brand from comics to television.  He had mixed success, but making the jump to cartoons introduced legions of fans (me included) to Marvel characters and Stan Lee's voice introducing each show with breathless wonder.Lee's legacy is no longer extricable from the evolution of comic books.  As a man, Lee has some obvious flaws, but it's thanks to him -- and the other creators he mentions in passing -- that we have the comic books of today.  This is perhaps Lee's final soap box, and it's a fine conclusion to a great story.  He's earned it.",1359072000,2013-01-25

While my favorite show &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; is in hiatus and I was going through withdrawals (haha!) I discovered this little gem. It certainly filled my need for an apocalyptic program. Over the years I've skipped right past this on cable while channel surfing, big mistake! I've certainly learned not to judge too quickly! This show has everything, great character's, action, suspense, romance, family, and even the (I don't know what to call it?) like/hate relationship between Mason and Pope. I have to say without Pope the show wouldn't be the same. He's a bad guy who really isn't all that bad. I'll admit the &#34;Mech's&#34; freak me out, the scariest creatures on this show.

3.0,"Being Human Season 1 is an odd show.  Developing the characters are difficult because the whole basis for the storyline is so unusual.  A werewolf who ran away from home after being turned into one, a Vampire turned during the Revolutionary war, and a Ghost as main characters who through the &#34;wisdom&#34; of the aged vampire decide to try and live together and help each other to live as close to a normal human existence as possible.  Vamps and werewolves are natural enemies making it odd, the Ghost a bit clueless yet they somehow bond as friends even though they don't really do a lot to help each other out in dealing with their own form of difficulties in being a monster trying to be more human.  Somehow the writing is good enough that it held my interest enough to watch it.  There are some interesting twists introduced in the stories that you really would never think of unless thinking of this in  a comical situation, but it isn't a comedy.  I'm not really sure what it is, but season one fumbles through each of them living together frequently enough to at least become a support system to each other in their attempts to be human when not.  In doing so it develops enough that it held my interest through the first two seasons.  Since SyFy only makes 13 episode seasons character development is something that has to occur as the story develops because there aren't enough episodes to give us any background and so it is written into episodes as flashbacks and fragmented memories of the past, and the present as the past intersects with the present.  I'm watching the third season now, so the show has held my attention through not with the enthusiasm of most SyFy shows I like.  But I do keep watching, there is a unique aspect to the show that no other has touched on and has its entertaining moments.  It is different, and good enough that I've watched it.  If not for being able to stream it I NEVER would have made it through the first season on TV.  But streaming you get your answers faster so shows that aren't as good deliver faster just because your watching them back to back from historical seasons.  I think that is the saving aspect of Being Human is that I'm streaming it and able to watch a season fairly quick so it holds my attention.  I doubt it will win any awards and am actually surprised it lasted 3 seasons, but as I said, it does have its moments.",1404604800,2014-07-06

Then suddenly we are expected to believe that a handful of old, white males are controlling the fate of the free world by manipulating those who are sworn enemies to the &#34;west&#34;.  Soooo, the world we see in Rubicon is in sharp contrast to that we see depicted in &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; (supposedly true events set to drama). Either it takes exhaustive intelligence resources, years of analysis, and unexpected good fortune to finally make breakthrough in finding the most high-profile terrorist in the world-- or, as portrayed in &#34;Rubicon&#34;, the whole material world is controlled-not by an industry, or a conglomerate of industries- but a few conspirators. Such an outlandish assumption REQUIRES adequate explanation. Otherwise, the story is an insult to those fighting our battles- and their loved ones. No wonder this series stopped production when it did. The storytellers wound themselves up so tight in their own trap, there was no way to continue with anyone to follow.",1391385600,2014-02-03
4.0,"I got this after reading all the reviews and i have to admit they were accurate. Once the movie kicks into gear, it's got enough jolts to qualify as scary good. What surprised me most was how the shocking moments were made up of simple old fashioned things: A fast camera movement, a shadow, a flickering light, a sound. It's also well cast. All the actors do a great job.",1370908800,2013-06-11
1.0,"I was a fan of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, so I had high hopes for this.Well, we've got lots of shots of scantily clad young women, no chemistry between characters, no endearing characters, and a story about a kidnapped and abused girl.  Nothing like delving into a parent's worst nightmare with characters we don't care about.  Oh well, that's that.",1267228800,2010-02-27
4.0,Stumbled into this movie after watching Hansel and Gretel. I thought Gretel is a great and sexy actress and wanted to check out other movies. She is definitely hot in this movie..the story and other actors are somewhat lame and it takes dedication to watch the movie to the end. Still great scenes with Gretel..reason for the 4 stars.,1374019200,2013-07-17

5.0,"This was a great season, though it became very complicated in the final 2-3 episodes.The pace is fast and the characters never boring.  I love to watch Gabriel Macht more than any of the others.  His facial expressions are perfect and he never seems to be out of character.This show is perfect for young adults and over.  I am 70, so I catch many of the innuendos involving movies and TV shows of the past.  It is a smart, intelligently written show which does not degrade or lower the expectations of the viewer.",1402790400,2014-06-15
5.0,I was so disappointed that it came to an  end. I had invested time and interest in these characters and wanted to see more.

4.0,"Because of my wife, I've been watching more mysteries than I probably would given my own devices. I've come to enjoy them more and am getting better at seeing the difference between decent ones and really good ones. This is north of decent but south of really good.Here's the scoop. Martin (Elijah Wood) travels to Oxford in the hopes of being sponsored by Arthur Seldom (John Hurt) for his doctoral thesis. The owner of the home at which he is staying is murdered and leads to other, seemingly clever, math based, murders. Martin and Arthur team up with inspector Peterson (Jim Carter) in the hopes of solving the equation and catching the killer.This, like all good mysteries, is very clever. But that one of the main components is high level math, I felt left out at various times. There are the various red herrings and love story on the side, but most of it involves very high level thinking and reasoning. When Martin and Arthur match wits on their deductions I struggled to keep up. Also, like many mysteries, the end is not the end. Yes the murders are solved but the mystery remains so there are a couple of post script scenes. And, as has been done in mysteries since time began, there is a long soliloquy in the final scene tying everything together. Don't blink during this scene.I've only seen one other film by director Alex de la Iglesia but I liked it a lot. This is all very professional with a good cast and good production values. Enjoy it. Try to keep up and take it as it is. It's enjoyable but it probably won't make your top mystery 5.",1392336000,2014-02-14

5.0,"I really love this Canadian show, I fell in love with the main characters right away, which is pretty rare, usually I have to see quite a few episodes to decide. I really  like the &#34;Columbo&#34; way the show is written, you know who the victim is, and you know who the killer is from the start, then it unfolds as the detectives work the cases.You won't be disappointed, give this show a try!",1398124800,2014-04-22

5.0,"Lotta love/hate out there for Vikings...but I propose the questions: anyone else attempting this genre? That's a &#34;no&#34;, and for their ambitious attempt (and I'd argue successful one, more often than not) I think the creators of Vikings deserve praise. Additionally, the cast, especially Ragnar, have an authentic feel to them, and the sets are really well done.If the subject matter even slightly interests you, give it a shot.",1388534400,2014-01-01

It's worth the inconvenience to watch though.",1403049600,2014-06-18
4.0,The Bosch character was intriguing and made me want to champion him. The supporting cast was &#34;meh&#34;. Better actors could've been cast to make a more enjoyable episode.,1394323200,2014-03-09
5.0,"This season of Supernatural was fairly different from the others. While still carrying an episodic feel there was enough of all elements/characters recurring that it wasn't exactly the same as the first two. This season also started to mix in more light hearted hurmorous episodes among the darker and intense ones, which I didn't mind as I had grown to really like what humor had previously been shown.As for the additions of the female anti heroes, I actually grew to enjoy their presence on the show. Yes, they made the Winchesters look childish but that's actually how they have behaved previously, just no one called them out on it. Also it was pretty interesting to have demons be given more personality and learn that not all of them are completly evil and have motives.Despite that, I did find some flaws within the season. Sam and Deans arguments got even more repetitive, a couple characters from season 2 were written out of this season and the demon army didn't get mentioned that much, which was surprising as I thought total choas would've erupted from the release of those demons.All in all, the show took some new steps that I liked and keeps it going.",1396569600,2014-04-04
5.0,Hilarious show. I watch it also because the dances are awesome. Abbey is a hoot. Even thought a little mean at time.,1383696000,2013-11-06
4.0,A nice counterpoint to the lasting damage waged by Christina Crawford in &#34;Mommie Dearest.&#34; Great review of the career of one of Hollywood's most enduring and hardest working stars of the Golden Age. Some background and behind the scenes info brings Miss Crawford to life. It's hard to believe the woman Christine wrote about is the same woman. Ultimately Crawford's work outlasts any hatchet jobs by spiteful children getting revenge for being left out of the will.,1377820800,2013-08-30
2.0,"This season is not  so exciting as the other seasons. I don't feel the same vibe on the caracthers, or maybe it is just the fact that they do not work well separately. Yes, they all got separated after the prison fell down, it is amazing to think that they would not have a few encounter points for that kind of a mess, or a safe house as per say; where they could meet and regroup or just leave a note to where they are trying to get headed.I know it is all volatile, but come on, there are so many places...I just hope they get reunited soon because it is all boring so far!",1393891200,2014-03-04
4.0,I watched this because I really like the original Dance Moms with Abby Lee Miller.  This is about a dance studio taught by 2 guys and it is enjoyable.  I think the original Dance Moms is better but this show was with an interesting cast of characters in it.  If you like Dance Moms you will enjoy this show,1397347200,2014-04-13
4.0,"This comedy probably has more appeal for the under 35 crowd. The 3 main characters were college roommates & they continue to be roommates even after they find a job at Telamericorp, a telemarketing company.

In Checkpoint Gnarly they take their boss's brother out for a night on the town which leads to some funny misadventures.",1341446400,2012-07-05
5.0,The show is hilarious. Great cast of dysfunctional friends and family that hits many way too close to home. I laugh but can almost feel the pain of the situations that the family goes through. Show is fun to watch I think you can put it with any of the sitcoms out there that make you laugh. definitely worth watching.,1388707200,2014-01-03

5.0,"King Henry VIII was a pivotal figure in English and Western history.  As the Protestant Reformation sweeps Europe, the great question is whether England will remain Catholic, under the Pope's authority, or whether the King's authority shall predominate in England.  King Henry VIII settled this matter for all time, at a time when religious authority truly mattered to the conduct of national affairs in Europe.This series is dazzlingly presented, with fine acting and a gripping, if somewhat leisurely, storyline.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers turns in a bravo performance as King Henry VIII--his intensity in the role is vibrant and convincing.  Sam Neill, as usual, is particularly fine as English Cardinal Wolsey, the King's Chancellor and confidant.  Along with Meyers he dominates Season One.  All of other the key roles are splendidly cast, and the sets are lavish; this is a beautiful production.Season 1 takes us from Henry's ascension to the throne, during which he gains confidence in his role of King of England and head of state--to his love of Anne Boleyn and his rejection of the queen.  The viewer sees in action Machiavelli's admonishment in The Prince that it is deadly to cross a Prince, and dangerous to be his friend.This series is eminently watchable and a great introduction to a critical period in European history.  If it takes liberties with history, the discerning viewer will not mind.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1273968000,2010-05-16
1.0,"The show starts out with a scene of consensual sex (oral sex). Later, the woman who was performing the oral sex is shown in a flashback.. being raped. I didn't even make it through the first episode. I am concerned about so many people tolerating so much these days. Fairly graphic sex and violence in shows like this can lead to an increase in appetite for more intensely graphic sex and violence.  I realize most people don't care at all what they watch, or give any thought to what they watch, and will just sit there and absorb anything. It's too bad. I think it is wise for all of us to be careful what we put in our minds.  I don't think the average person will watch a show like this, then go out and rape someone. But, I think watching such things does have a negative effect on us in some way.",1393200000,2014-02-24
4.0,"The people trapped in hoarding have mostly gained my sympathy. There are a few exceptions, those too self centered or who are plain mean, but for the most part the people in these vignettes are very damaged and mentally ill. I find it especially heartbreaking when they decide to clean up their act only to find their homes so damaged by neglect that they are no longer inhabitable. Sometimes it's laziness, sometimes it's mental illness but it's always interesting. I'm glad not to be a hoarder!",1380844800,2013-10-04

5.0,"This is a science fiction show.  If you don't like sci-fi, you should pass.  For sci-fi fans this show has gotten better as the season (2) progresses.  It's all about time travel and the what would happen if a group of people went back in time in order to change the future.  The production in the first season was definitely for B level sci fi fare but I've upgraded it to an ""A"" as the plot unfolds during this season.  Episonde 12 and 13 have some decent fight scenes.  You can't jump into the middle of the 2nd season and expect to figure out what's going on.  Each show builds upon the previous episode.  You're best bet would be to start with episode 1 of season 1 and see if you want to buy the rest of the 2 seasons.  If you liked other TV sci-fi shows (star trek, stargate) then this show should be at least worthy of streaming from Amazon.  I stream the basic level and not the HD version and it looks fine on my 80"" TV.",1375142400,2013-07-30

5.0,"It took a little while for me to warm up to the show - i liked it but didn't spend a whole night sleepless watching it until around episode 7, at which point there was no turning back.  As others mention already, the set designs, actors and screenplay are very well done.. but what intrigued me most was that the historical period of the story basically coincides with the division of the church, from the rule of Catholicism to the outbranches of ""protest""-antism.  And the show goes on to become a study almost (and a very entertaining one at that) of the way this came to be (in England).  The story does a pretty fair job of presenting both the integrity and corruption of the Catholicism of Europe at the time and it likewise shows how and what drove the king to accept ""reformist"" versions of Christianity.  It's a fascinating study of a subject I really knew very little about and I come away feeling more informed somehow, and entertained into the bargain.  Even if religion isn't your thing, religion and politics were once quite married and intermixed with the state and it's fascinating to see these things portrayed - and to compare them with where we are now.  A fascinating historical story.  It's no wonder Shakespeare put it on the stage in his day.  Showtime has just sexed it up a bit.  And speaking of sex, if this show doesn't convince you of the power that libido plays behind the scenes, nothing will!",1341446400,2012-07-05
5.0,"On Tuesday, October 8, 2013, BBC Home Entertainment will release last year's creep mini-series The Secret of Crickley Hall on a single-disc DVD, which is based on the novel of the same name by author James Herbert. The ghostly mini-series is coming out just in time for Halloween and stars Maisie Williams from HBO'sGame of Thronesand Olivia Cooke from A&E;'sBates Motel.The mini-series aired in three one-hour parts last fall on BBC America and on UK's BBC One. It switches back and forth from the year 2006 and 1943. It begins in London, where Gabe and Eve Caleigh's young son, Cameron (or as they call ""Cam""), vanishes without a trace. Eleven months go by and there is still no sign of the boy. Wanting to get away from the one-year anniversary of Cam's disappearance, Gabe, Eve and their two daughters, Loren (played by Maisie Williams) and Cally, move to the north part of England, aka Crickley Hall - a former orphanage.Flip back in time to 1943, Nancy Linnet (played by Olivia Cooke) begins teaching school at the Crickley Hall, which is owned by the strange Augustus Cribben. A young Jewish German student named Stefan refuses to speak English and Nancy notices unusual markings on Stefan's hands, markings that match the size of the cane that belongs to Mr. Cribben. To make matters worse, she begins to believe Mr. Cribben's sister, Magda, is a little to close to a teenager student, Maurice Stafford. Nancy tries to get others to believe the children are in danger, but no one believes her, except for the ground keeper, Percy Judd. The children are in danger and Nancy will give her life to save them.Back to 2006, Eve Caleigh has a strange feeling that there is something wrong with her new home, Crickley Hall. The family dog, Clyde, is afraid to go near the house and begins barking, leading the family to meet the ex-ground keeper, Percy Judd, who believes the house is haunted.After settling into their new home, Eve picks up a spinning-top that fell from a shelf and she hears Cam's voice. While Gabe thinks their son is dead, Eve still has hope that he is somehow alive. Meanwhile, the family is unaware that the deceased former owner of Crickley Hall still walks the halls.I had never heard of the book or mini-series before, but the freaky DVD cover caught my attention. Plus, it has two actresses (Maisie Williams and Olivia Cooke) from my favorite television shows (Game of Thrones and Bates Motel), along with the outstanding cast of Tom Ellis, Suranne Jones and David Warner. It is less like the current clich&eacute;d paranormal horror movies and more like a traditional ghost story that doesn't have to rely on nudity, bad language and gore to scare the audiences, but instead it relies on a well-plotted script and an eerie atmosphere. There are not many scares, but it didn't bother me one bit as I was intrigued with the characters. The Secret of Crickley Hall is a creepy well-written ghost story and it would make a great DVD to watch at Halloween.*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.",1380672000,2013-10-02
3.0,I liked the show because of the respect that the kids showed in helping their elders but some blanks needs to be filled in. When the young man gave her that ring it's true that she never promise herself to him but if you're going to show him in that light (a lier) it should have happen way before she saw him again in the club. Othewise she had no reason to say that he had cursed her life. He has no reason to be haunting her. Good luck.,1393718400,2014-03-02

3.0,"This is a good series with procedural episodes that have longer multi episode story lines mixed in. The way they tie the effects of an artifact to it's historical background is ingenious. I give this 3 stars because it's the multi episode story lines that being you back for more. The individual episode sorry lines can range from very good to very corny. Some of the special effects are sub par compared to the quality of the rest of the production. I also personally feel they tend to lighten a lot of the episodes up too much with unneeded and often poorly delivered humor. Some people however will feel this is the charm of the show. At the end of the day, if you like syfy and can look past (or enjoy) some cheesy humor or episodes that break up the good story lines then this site is very much work watching.",1396137600,2014-03-30

I definitely want more back ground on the suspected serial killer he kills at the beginning of the show.  I'm sure if this becomes a series it will come out during the trial.  Characters were pretty good. Titus Welliver plays his character very well. I'd be interested in watching more and see how this develops. I also want to him to catch the person responsible for killing the boy they found in the woods.  I suspect there's more then just one out there.

The only thing I don't like about the show is that there is almost ALWAYS one contestant in every episode who uses a dying or recently deceased loved one who may or may not have had cancer as leverage.

3.0,"As a HUGE fan of cop shows and procedurals, I was really looking forward to loving this pilot.  Production value is top notch, the casting director truly knows talent and the location access was pretty impressive.  Unfortunately, that's where the positive ends.Granted, I'm not familiar with the books but I shouldn't have to be to recognize a good show.  Given it's virtual who's who of talented character actors this should have been a slam dunk.  I don't think you can ask for a better lead than Titus Welliver in anything but given his skill-set, you've got to give him more to &#34;play&#34; than these cop procedural 101 scenes.You're asking me to follow him as a lead but don't really give me a reason to.  By the end of the piece I still have no real sense of who he is or how he operates.  Against the grain like Greg House or quietly clever like Columbo.  There is no character meat.  And that is saying something considering that Titus is one of the most &#34;character rich&#34; actors working today.In the pilot, nobody really likes him and no one really doesn't like him.  He's so middle-of-the-road I don't know if I like him.  All his relationships are identical, male or female with the possible exception of his partner played by Jamie Hector.  AKA one of the only actor who managed to find an interesting character to play given the trite, mundane dialogue of this entire show.  That said, I want to give special shout-outs to Amy Aquino and Alan Rosenberg who also shine through the plodding.Ultimately, it comes down to the writing that stops me from loving the show.  It's a so-so script.  For lack of a better term, it is &#34;lazy&#34;.  Especially for a show where you're not solving any cases in an single episode.  You've got time for the coming situations to breathe and happen more organically, right?  But the script doesn't use it.Classic example: There is a nice love interest brewing with Annie Wersching's character, Julia Brasher.  But the characters never have to work for it, you know?  A veteran officer and a rookie meet at a crime scene and are on a semi-first date within scenes of a 50 minute pilot.  This would be so much more interesting and rewarding had they let this happen more organically over several run-ins and/or incidents,  so it doesn't feel like this happening because the procedural handbook of a script says so.Another example --  The lieutenant (Amy Aquino) comes to Bosch's home to chew his ass.  She lays down the law and shuts him down and he needs to convince her to temporarily &#34;look the other way&#34;.  Does he maybe tell her how he's been slipping the last few years and need this to get back to the cop he knows he can be again?  No.  Does he then maybe tell her &#34;With all due respect, don't threaten me, Lieu.  I'm gonna close this case for you&#8230;for me.  Either arrest me now or get out of my way and let me do it.  I'm asking for a second chance here.&#34;Either of which would given us more drama (possibly) or, a least, given us more sense of the man.  But, no, he doesn't do either. Instead he hands her a box with a bone in it and says, &#34;Look at this.&#34;  And she, who's seen 1000 bones in her career and will most likely see 1000 more before it's over -- caves.  WTF?!  Really?!We, as an audience, are not challenged or engaged in the piece because our lead character is not.",1391817600,2014-02-08

4.0,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:I just can't fathom a more harsh penalty promulgated by my delay then to have follow a ""K-Harris"" review!I can't add anything to the excellent outline provided by K-Harris, though perhaps I can compliment with some additional color.  The performances are excellent and as huge fan of UK programming, the 3-main characters all have fine pedigrees:Steven Mackintosh (John the cash house manager) most recently off a stint in the *5 ""Luther""Ashley Walters (Chris the security guard) was seen in ""Hustle"" and ""Outcasts"" among a number of other seriesWarren Brown (Marcus at what can be best described as a clerk that moves the trolleys of cash into the vault) was in the excellent Zombie themed mini-series ""Dead Set""I thought that the plotting was good, though I am not the biggest fan of sequences that move back and forth through timelines.  What really interested me was the motives of the 3-individuals and particularly those of John whose star was on the rise and had a newly adopted daughter (their only child).  While it is not a perfect parallel, John reminds me of a similar character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in what was in my opinion a top 3 movie of the year in 2003 entitled ""Owning Mahowny"".  When PSH's character is asked about the rush he felt when gambling as compared to regular life.  On a scale of 10 he replied ""10 and 2"".I watched the series over 2-nights and would recommend as both a very good program and an excellent well acted change of pace from the norm.",1345420800,2012-08-20

3.0,Overall Prison Break was a very good show. Show title could have been better. This season they are put in a prison in another country and have to break someone out. Not a good season at all.

4.0,"I like this sort of movie, so for me all that was missing was some popcorn.  I thought some of the actors were very good.  The movie changes venues a few times, so that kept it from getting boring, (we get to spend the evening at a bar in a long intermission from ghost hunting during the middle) and it lacked the annoying screaming that ruins so many movies and tv shows for me.  The ending was a bit surprising, although overall it wasn't really a super scary movie, and I scare easy. Not much in the way of graphic violence either, which I also liked about it.  It was a bit like watching a Paranormal State episode or something.  Some of the music was pretty good.  Bring popcorn and a sense of humor. ;)",1368316800,2013-05-12
4.0,"Several reviewers have commented on the basic themes of Rithy Panh's documentary; what is perhaps more interesting is the way in which the title operates on two levels.  First, Panh's film aims to fill in &#34;the missing picture&#34; of life in Cambodia under the Pol Pot regime.  For most of the time, the only visual material available on this regime was propaganda films depicting an idealized world of workers happily contributing to the new country Kampuchea's collective sense of well-being.  Through a mixture of clay figures and archive footage, Panh proves the opposite; most citizens had to get used to a combination of perpetual hunger and enforced labor.  The clay figures are an important element of this film, suggesting that human beings can be rendered malleable in any way their makers/ captors choose.  At another level, the film tries to recreate the &#34;missing picture&#34; of Panh's past; at the age of fifty, he looks back at his childhood in the pre-Pol Pot era, a world of color and variety that was ruthlessly swept away, as the people were forced to wear black and work inhumanly long hours in the rice-fields.  The experience left an indelible mark on Panh's character, as he lost most of his family due to starvation, without being able to do a thing about it.  Even now he feels guilty for his inaction.  Living under a tyrannous regime was bad enough, but what was much worse for Panh was the way in which that regime rendered him powerless, as well as depriving his life of the possibilities - both personal as well as professional - that could have been available in the pre-Pol Pot era.  The &#34;missing picture&#34; cannot be recreated, however hard he tries.  The film ends on a somber note, as Panh reminds us how much the souls of the millions who died during the Pol Pot regime still haunt those who survived.  While efforts have been made to erase the past (a lake has been built over one of the mass graves), he still feels somehow united with the dead rather than the living - an indication, perhaps, of the emotional and physical consequences of tyranny.  While THE MISSING PICTURE offers a country-specific interpretation of the past, its message should be heeded by everyone about the consequences of living under an absolutist government.",1401062400,2014-05-26
5.0,"Presently, science fiction is undergoing a bit of a renaissance in theatres.  There's been a trend for a number of years now to produce films which have stronger ties of very human messages.  With motion pictures like DISTRICT 9, MONSTERS, CLOVERFIELD, and even 2011's BATTLE: LOS ANGELES, writers and directors have been spinning tales about the increasing human cost to our sci-fi encounters with the unknown.  Some of them have focused more heavily on the action quotient, but, by these films' conclusions, there has been ample analysis of the risks to the `regular folks' when faced with the unknown, may it take the shape of aliens, monsters, or other organisms.  PERFECT SENSE continues in this same mold, upping the stakes for individuals.  This time around, it isn't aliens we're facing.  Instead, it's an inescapable virus.Two self-possessed young professionals - a gourmet chef (Ewan McGregor) and a epidemiologist (Eva Green) - find one another at the most trying time in human history: mankind is falling victim to a mysterious plague that robs us of our senses - one by one.  Can a cure for what ails them - the plague or their own narcissism - reach them in time?I won't spoil it, but I will say that PERFECT SENSE is a perfect winner of a film.  Its narration bobs and weaves back and forth between the standard linear - think any other story - and the documentary - scenes and images captured from the greater world at large.  The more we get to know our two principles, the more that's stripped away from them, only forcing us to understand them even more as they collectively lose their sense of smell, then taste, then hearing.  It's as much a cautionary tale as it is an old school romance - boy-meets-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, but aren't they fated to find one another again? - is the best possible sense.  McGregor and Green's performances are comfortable and measured, especially when they're at the weakest - be it having one more layer of their humanity whisked away from them or when they're lost in one another's arms.  It's tragic and meaningful - sharp and resourceful - and, if you take it all to heart, you'll definitely come away with a tremendous appreciation for what smart science fiction looks like in the modern age.PERFECT SENSE is a product of IFC FILMS and BBC FILMS with participation from Zentropa Entertainments 5, the Danish Film Institute, Film I Vast, Bord Scannan Na Heireann / the Irish Film Board, and Sigma Films.  The script is from Kim Fupzaakeson, and it's directed with great attention to detail by David Mackenzie.  It all looks and sounds grand here, though I'll admit that I had to crank the volume quite a way up through part of Green's narrated voiceovers; I don't know if it was a fault of the original recording track or the fact that perhaps it was mixed noticeably lower than the rest of the piece.  Sadly, the disc only contains two features - a making-of short (2 minutes long?) and the trailer - and I would've definitely loved to have much, much more by way of commentaries and longer documentaries, giving more insight into this very special film.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.  Poignant and relevant, PERFECT SENSE will challenge you to think about your life and the greater world around you in ways you may never have before, and it just might have you clinging to that special someone, lingering a few extra moments in her embrace or her scent if for no other reason than for it to remain fresh in your mind.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at IFC Films provided me with a DVD screener copy of PERFECT SENSE for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1338508800,2012-06-01

5.0,"Giants, ogres, werewolves, Frankenstein, Mulan, Captain Hook ... what do all the things have in common?  Once Upon a Time Season Two, that's what!  This is the series that has single-handedly changed the face of television fantasy and made ABC a major player in creative, prime-time entertainment.This show has almost limitless possibilities and (at the writing of this review) is creatively satisfying the potential of an ever-expanding setting while maintaining continuity with previous episodes.  To date Once Upon still hasn't sold out to the HBO/Showtime/AMC paradigm of dark/edgy/gritty; a thematic bandwagon I'm so sick of I could literally vomit and more importantly they stick with the main characters from season one, continuing to develop them in a huge way (e.g. the welcome ""manning up"" of Charming) while constantly introducing new ones.Also, I've sort of come to expect sub-standard or straight-up cheesy FX from television as a given and this is where Once Upon just continues to amaze me.  What I really find astonishing is when I hear other people actually labeling the CG as bad... I guess I just don't get it.  I mean if we see a dragon on TV we already know it's not real; we just hope it's convincing enough to maintain the illusion that the events we're watching might actually be taking place somewhere... out there.  I say kudos to the producers for their frugal reliance on CG which is inherently a technology always one step ahead of being outdated and overly scrutinized as more people become fluent in graphics tech.  In other words, too many people know how the trick is done to maintain the illusion if it's the only trick up the sleeve, so to speak, and so I guess it's a good thing that Once Upon excels in the areas of camera-work (including green-screen), costumes, sets, lighting, makeup, fighting and action choreography.This is a bigger season with more action, lots of unexpected and clever plot twists, new realms and more fantasy than season one with just enough added drama to enhance adult appeal without detracting from the original premise; less emphasis on Emma, spotlight on Charming and Snow as their characters are reinvigorated, less of Henry, much more of The Dark One (i.e. Mr. Gold), sllightly less screen-time for the Evil Queen as new dangers and villains are introduced and based on the way this series is gaining momentum, I'd predict it may very well be a five year run because it just ""feels"" like the writers, producers, actors etc. actually enjoy what they're doing.  :o)",1355184000,2012-12-11

I found myself laughing at his parts most of all.It was a great story that kept me engaged the whole time and kept me wanting to start the next episode right away. I'm always excited when I find a show like this, the only bad thing is when it's over. And 10 episodes goes by rather quickly but it is a great ride.On a plus note You do not need to be familiar with the movie to enjoy this. In fact, I wish I hadn't seen the movie before watching this. As I think the movie actors had a little bit better accents &#34;Yah know&#34;. Plus I was always mentally comparing scenes from the movie to the show.

4.0,"First impression notwithstanding - that House of Anubis comes off as a Harry Potter movie only with chump change budget - this is a pretty cool show. Yes, it's catered for the tweeners. It is cheesy, and the characters are schoolyard roster caricatures, and the occult portions come off fairly subdued. But dang if it weren't a constant source of guilty pleasure for me. Yeah, I gobbled the show up.Somewhere in the United Kingdom is the House of Anubis, stately old dormitory nestled on the grounds of a prestigious boarding school. To this dormitory approaches upbeat American teenager Nina Martin (Nathalia Ramos). She's tsk-tsked for showing up two weeks late, but what's one to do when the scholarship is derailed by red tape? Nina harbors hopes of making friends fast, but there go them hopes when her arrival coincides with the mysterious departure of one of the students, Joy (Klariza Clayton). When Joy's best mate, Patricia (Jade Ramsey), is unable to contact her, she suspects Nina of having something to do with the disappearance and begins to make her life miserable. It's a crap welcome for Nina. It doesn't help that the school staff seem to be going out of their way to eradicate all signs that Joy was ever there.Luckily, Nina strikes up friendships with other schoolmates - the level-headed Fabian (Brad Kavanagh) and the flighty but amiable Amber (Ana Mulvoy Ten). And when the whodunit elements begin to mount up, these three found the Sibuna club (And ""Sibuna"" backwards is what?). So why are the attic and the cellar strictly off limits to the students? What are these cryptic clues Nina keeps stumbling over? And what sort of no good shenanigans is Victor Rodenmaar (Francis Magee) up to, him who's the very dodgy dormitory caretaker and who looks like Luke Perry's creepy old uncle? Good thing that, to quote a Sibuna member, ""Nina is super-sleuthy."" Maybe she can figure out why certain suspicious so-and-so's are trying to ""tip the scales of life.""There's an amusing exchange between two faculty members that somehow solidified my liking for this show: In the scene Victor is complaining about the meddling students in his cranky care, calling them ""nauseating, arrogant, interfering children,"" at which point one of the other teachers wrily observes: ""Do you sometimes think you might be in the wrong job, Victor?"" Heh.To offset all the skullduggery the show also tracks the antics of other kids in Anubis House not involved in the ongoing mystery. But, honestly, I could've done without pranksters Jerome and Alfie whose infantile goings-on were mostly lame and insensitive. Made it hard for me to like them. Mara (Tasie Dhanraj), on the other hand, is perfectly lovely. She's smart and really sweet and so unassuming. I'm a bit baffled that she wasn't part of the inner clique. I think Mara is wasted with the silly sideplots - mostly involving her crush on the house jock - that she gets swept into. But probably the tweener girls will swoon over the oodles of pining and self-sacrificing done by Mara. The adorable Tasie Dhanraj makes it all palatable.If you're raring for secret societies and cryptic clues and hidden passages and panels and mystical artifacts... If you're hankering for Goosebumps-style thrills and a smidge of ancient Egyptian history... If you're entertained by campy yet high stakes cat-and-mouse games played out between the pupils and the secretive school faculty, well, House of Anubis delivers on all fronts. And if you're a parent or a guardian and you're looking for some harmless fun for your kids to watch, House of Anubis does offer good lessons in teamwork and perseverance and thinking outside the box. Adversely, the kids in the show do tend to routinely sneak out past their curfew. They do thumb their noses at the authority of certain adult figures, never mind that these adults seem UP TO NO GOOD. My two cents: This show is so cheerfully campy and over-the-top it can't help but come off as all in good fun.",1400025600,2014-05-14

4.0,"This is one of SyFy's more adventurous shows and hopefully marks a return to science fiction for a network that has given up on some of its classic franchises and strayed into wrestling and other bizarre material choices in recent years.Drawing on several similar ""Wild West with aliens"" concepts, there's enough originality and confidence in the production to mark its own territory. The mostly-international cast is excellent, the make-up is believable and the CGI is impressive for a weekly show.As with any new show, it's six weeks into the run and still finding its feet. Pacing has been variable, from a non-stop exciting pilot to a couple of almost introspective episodes in the last few weeks. In a desire to explore so many characters, it sometimes feels like we don't see enough of the more interesting people that appeared frequently early on.Still, the world of Defiance is well thought-out with a good mixture of personalities in the different alien races. The plot moves between the immigration stories of different cultures, the politics of a small town frontier, and does well to introduce new elements of the major characters to keep the audience guessing.Defiance has been renewed for a second season and if SyFy gives it the chance the develop, we might well have another Battlestar Gallactica on our hands if it's given the time it needs. Despite some issues, it's infinitely superior to many of the science fiction offerings we've seen recently.",1368748800,2013-05-17

4.0,"I really enjoyed this show.Premise: the ""official"" story is that Alcatraz closed in 1963 due to high maintenance costs and it being run down, so the prisoners were all relocated, but in truth they all just disappeared one day without a trace... some 50 years later they are mysteriously coming back, not having aged a day since 1963 and not knowing what happened to them - they just seem to pop back into reality. They are also provisioned and seem to each have been given a mission by someone. These criminals have to be caught quickly and ""under the radar"" (as how could their existence possibly be explained?  They were all ""officially"" dead, complete with death certificates etc. in the official records - and how do you explain the not aging?)So, there is an FBI agent (who used to be a guard at Alcatraz) with a secret team of helpers, the old shifty doctor from Alcatraz, an Asian woman shrink trying to catch and re-imprison them. [The Asian woman was evidently one of the first of the missing Alcatraz people to ""come back""]. They base their operation out of Alcatraz, in areas off limits to tourists.  They enlist the help of a female police detective (granddaughter to a key 1963 Alcatraz prisoner) who makes them also agree to a partner she picks. She picks a guy who is a comic book writer/illustrator, with a doctorate (he is something of a genius) who had written books on Alcatraz - the leading authority on everything Alcatraz. He seems to be the moral compass of the group, reminding the others that someday their task will be done and they will have to live with whatever they did.The episodes flow back and forth between showing Alcatraz in the early '60s and in the present, so you get background on things that were going on as well as back stories on each prisoner they're trying to catch, and what that prisoner is up to now. Usually focusing on 1 returned prisoner at a time, but towards the end of season 1 there are multiple in play at a time as the story builds.As long as you just go with it and not wonder if they were really allowed certain privileges or if the guards really behaved like that, or why this prisoner was at the prison for ""the worst of the worst"" instead of any other prison etc. it works. The stories/episodes are interesting and there are plenty of mysteries to be solved over time so the show held my interest.Decent story idea, decent scripts and acting - holds your interest.  Hopefully season 2 will be as good (on many shows, after a great first season, the writers get all squirrely and do not live up to the first season in my book) -- fingers crossed!  I'm looking forward to the solving of the mysteries.",1344816000,2012-08-13

5.0,"I must admit, on first viewing I wasn't all that impressed, in fact I had rated this thing a 4, but afterwatching it a second time, maybe with a few more beers down my neck, I love this flick and I am lauging my AO!OK, the family was crazy, but the problems with this film is that all the interesting and crazy members of thisfamily are either dead or in jail. The rest are just a bunch of redneck trailer trash pregnant women but they arepretty entertaining. I love the scene where Bertie is released from prison, goes to kidnap her husband from hisgirlfriend's house, hijacks him to the drug store where they got prescriptions for pain pills filled from thepharmacist who had originally married them. hahahahaaThis is a two hour marathon about a bunch of ignorant hicks from West Virginia. We got grandma, her daughter, anda bunch of grandkids sitting around her house smoking pot, snorting pain pills, and drinking beer they cant afford.But then how the hell do they all afford the drugs and cars cause none of them have jobs. You heard me, none of them,not one.I guess I wasn't so impressed with this insane flick cause being from Tennessee and knowing worse families, oh yeah,there's nothing here that I haven't seen before. These guys are a bunch of Pikeys compared to the Jetts, the Stinetts,Blackwells, and the Whiteheads of Marshall County. On second thought I may be a little jealous cause I wont be doingany Oxys, Roxys, Coke, or smoking any pot at my mom's house when I go home for Thanksgiving this years. LOL",1381622400,2013-10-13
3.0,For me the chemistry is gone.  I'm really sad about it too.  This was my very favorite show.  I hope the studio reads this and chooses better scripts. The new FBI storyline is a total snoozer and the personality of the FBI woman is like cardboard. I nearly turned Black Helicopters off before the end.

Their solution was to drag it out and hose down that nice comb and all the bees. One call to a local beekeeper and this problem would have been easily solved without all the drama.

Also like the arc of inclucing a mystery that Sara hasn't solved yet. Made me laugh. I though Sara was a little bratty in the beginning with always saying 'solved it' for minor solves. I would like to see that toned down if it makes it to production as it seemed forced with Sara saying 'solved it' too much and Sam trying to say he helped too.

5.0,"I wasn't much of an Office fan until somewhat recently, and I'm not quite sure why that is, but now I can't seem to get enough of it as I rewatch the seasons I currently own. I've now seen all of the episodes through season six, the second-to-last year of Michael Scott, and season four may very well be the best one, but it's a tough call because 3 and 5 are pretty darn good too.A few highlights include: Ryan is now at corporate, a funny and strange new variable; Andy starts dating Angela, with Dwight not entirely out of the picture; the Scanton branch creates a local advertisement; and Holly makes her debut in the finale, with Jan returning to get in the way of things.I of course recommend this to any fan of the Office. With that in mind; however, I would advise either purchasing or at least watching the previous season in its entirety first, for continuity purposes. Although some episodes in this season are better than others, I think every one of them are good and quite re-watchable. Either way, sit back and enjoy the hilarity that will ensue.",1333152000,2012-03-31

It's offbeat, sinister, and really weird. It's also well acted and directed. It's as much sci-fi as a crime story. We'll now never know why things happened, but I can think of a few things which I don't want to share and spoil this show for readers.The one criticism I have of the show is that every episode runs a bit too strictly to pattern, sort of like &#34;Dragnet.&#34; But &#34;Dragnet&#34; lasted for years, as this should have. There was much room for development and growth.",1371686400,2013-06-20

3.0,"Having read through the rest of the reviews, I can say that I agree with most of what was written and so shall not expand on the positive parts of the show.  However, I had to dock the show a couple of stars for lack of character development.To explain my reasoning: Josh and Sally in particular have not developed at all (in my opinion) during all 3 seasons. I find myself gritting my teeth like a mother with two 3-year old kids in the house who just cant seem to quiet down for a minute. Sally still has the bad habit of wanting to toss her *fairly petty* problems onto Josh and Aidan, many times without reading the mood because both of them come home in a shabby state usually just having passed through a horrible experience. I find her lack of empathy disturbing. Josh - well what can I say about Josh.. He has 1 day a month when he turns. Listening to him go on and on about being a werewolf.. blah blah blah blah blah. He still hasn't gotten to the point where he can say ""I have a rental box to change in, everything's fine.""  Aidan has to fight his thirst every day of the damn year, yet Josh and Sally seem oblivious to it, depending on him for (far too much) emotional support. Also, listening to Josh lay on the guilt trip when Aidan slips up and turns or kills a human.. He's a VAMPIRE. A true friend would help clean up the mess.I would have given this more stars, had Josh and Sally grown up a little from the pity party they are throwing themselves. Listening to Josh go on and on with his panic attacks while trying to revive Sally..  Oh please, just SHUT UP already so she can cast the damn spell.",1360195200,2013-02-07

As beautiful as the imagery and special effects were, I don't think they can carry you if you are not fascinated by what is being discussed. I definitely leaned more towards the space focused episodes, but all were interesting. Really well done, beautiful episodes. My husband and I were riveted every episode.Tyson was an excellent host, it was even better than the original Cosmos.I think I read this was supposed to only be 1 season but I would LOVE there to be more.

4.0,"I am a little conflicted about this season.  On one hand it did wrap up the show, tied in some things from prior seasons and did give it a sense of finality.  On the other hand, it was kind of an unnecessary season since we had already learned long ago who burned Michael, which was always the main storyline of the series.This season plays out the aftermath of the events that ended the prior season, and the deal Michael has to make to keep them all out of prison.  He agrees to take down a terrorist network, and as usual there are a lot of twists and turns throughout the season.  As you would expect with this show, not everyone makes it out unscathed.  Unlike a lot of shows that just end without a sense of finality to it, there is a definitive ""its over""  feel to the show.  The show does bring in a couple of Heroes alums in the great Jack Coleman (who was pretty much a regular for the entire season) and Adrian Pasdar, who was around for a handful of episodes.In all the season was good, but not as good as year's past.  There was a definite sense that the season was just used to play out the end of the series, which the show runners said they knew for a long time how they wanted it to end.  The ending was very good however and did give it a fitting sendoff.  As far as bonus material for those who like to go through the extras, there are commentary tracks on select episodes, deleted scenes on every disc, a gag reel and a 10 min feature on ending the series.  Not a ton of material, but good for what is there.",1388016000,2013-12-26
5.0,"This story is about 8 astronauts going on the first major space exploration of the solar system. Everyone, except for a very small minority see it as the heroic journey, a tribute to human achievement and curiosity. A small minority know the truth, that ""something"" not human is picking the crew and developing the mission but this is a closely guarded secrete.The show is well written. The story doesn't develop quickly but feels more like a carrot put before the horse, always just tantalizingly out of reach. This effect is well done and works mostly because each show is so rich in and of itself that it's fun instead of frustrating to wait for the show to progress.The show is also very well cast. Character development happens quickly through main plot line which is interlaced with flashbacks that open up the undercurrents to us. It doesn't take long to see the characters as multidimensional people and feel an emotional connection with them.I'm sorry to see yet another series canceled before it's time. It seems like some networks don't really get it's sci-fi audience.  It make take a few seasons to get a loyal following but once word gets out about a great sci-fi show it makes a big splash and the shows popularity can carry on for years after a show is over.  Unfortunately, as long as networks create great shows but cancel them prematurely it will give fans little reason to give the shows on their network a chance. After all, why get involved with a show that needs time to evolve if it's going to be canceled before you get to the good stuff.It's very frustrating to see a show with so much potential get canceled, especially after only one season.",1271203200,2010-04-14

It was a shame it was taken off the air, but I will say, they did one of the better jobs of wrapping up the storylines in a way that made sense and showed us what the characters would be doing in the future.  So many shows are abruptly cut off or stopped in the middle of a storyline that was supposed to be a lead-in for the next season, or even had the main character killed off...The writers and producers of &#34;In Plain Sight &#34; did it very well.

5.0,"I discovered this series after watching Robson Green play a clinical psychologist who explores the twisted psyches of serial killers on another police drama titledWire in the Blood - Complete First Season. Green certainly has a knack for portraying rather eccentric characters. In ""Touching Evil"", Green plays DI Dave Creegan who is assigned to the OSC (Organized and Serial Crime unit). After surviving a gunshot wound to the head, Creegan discovers a unique ability to get into the criminal mind. Creegan is assisted by DI Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker) and several others.Season 2 has three episodes:A Pupil of Murder - a reporter named Laney seems to have first dibs on the crimes of a serial killer who takes the hair of his victims as trophies. When the police catch up with the killer, Creegan's impulsive act results in a tragedy. However, even with the suspect in custody, the crime spree continues, and DI Taylor may be next on the list.The Caregiver - An ex-soldier is haunted by his experiences during the Bosnia War. He resorts to killing those who served with him, in a desperate attempt to erase those horrific memories.What Price a Child - Creegan gets intimately involved with a suspect in a child abduction case. Children go missing, and the police step up their efforts, focusing on several powerful men who are part of an international pedophilia ring. Meanwhile, Hawkins, father of a murdered victim from episode one has vengeance on his mind, and his target is not the killer, but DI Creegan whom he blames for the death of his beloved daughter. Trouble is, Creegan's own children may be targets too.Touching Evil is a gritty crime drama, and well worth watching for fans of the genre.",1318550400,2011-10-14
2.0,"Deadfall is a white noir, instead of being told in the shadows of the mean streets of the corrupt city, it takes place in the wide open snow covered wilderness. It is easy to identify that Deadfall wants to conjure up memories  of Fargo  or any other Cohen brothers movie for that matter, but ends up simply stuck a drift in it's own snow storm of tedium. This isn't a bad movie, per say, but it is middling, predicable and more often than not, dull. Which comes as a shame because the movie has a real great cast that is game for something more meaty.Telling the story of Addison (Eric Bana) and Liza (Olivia Wilde), a brother and sister team that just stuck up a tribal Casino. A car wreck leaves their driver dead and them stranded in the cold Michigan wilderness heading for the Canadian border.  They become separated and Liza hooks up with a stranger, Jay (British actor Charlie Hunnam), an Olympic silver medalist pugilist just out of jail and already on the run again. He wants to go home for Thanksgiving, but they end up stuck at a roadside motel for the night. She pretends he's her brother and he pretends she's a playboy centerfold, and somehow through all this they fall in love.Also add another subplot involving small town cop Hannah Becker (Kate Mara), trying to prove herself in a man's world and dealing with daddy issues involving the local sheriff (Treat Williams), who may be her father, but he is also a sexist, arrogant lout.Deadfall starts off very well with a great hook, but as it goes along it becomes tiresome and conventional. The early cinematography by Shane Hurlbut is excellent with a nicely done car crash and an exciting chase on snowmobiles, but like everything else in this movie becomes more pedestrian as it trots along.Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, an Austrian born director who won an Oscar for 2008's the Counterfeiters, making a very mild mew English language debut. Working from a half backed script by first time screenwriter Zach Bean, who manages yo fit more clich&eacute;s in a ninety-five minute movie than just about anyone this year. Bean's script seems cobbled together by bits and pieces of other movies, and not necessarily there best parts. It's plotting, it is rushed and there is little or no character development.Deadfall manages to almost descend into self parody with it's obvious and contrived ending that feels like the old Humphrey Bogart movie Desperate Hours, which itself was remade by Michael Cimino and starred Mickey Rourke, with a very special Thanksgiving twist. A holiday showdown in the snow.A very good cast is all that keeps this afloat. Eric Bana is superb in the central role, a tough guy villain that is easy to root for. Olivia Wilde proves she's much more than merely eye candy here, she is sweet, scared and sympatric in the role, she makes Liza simply more human, and this could be Wilde's best work so far.Kate Mara is excellent as rookie police officer Becker, she's smart and tough with the offbeat charisma that Mara is good at exhibiting. She's pretty, but not glamorous, and gives a clich&eacute;d role a more firm footing in reality, or at least she makes it appear so.Charlie Hunnam is just okay as Jay, a poor man's Tom Hardy the role is so underwritten that the actor is given little time to do much of anything, he's just there as the movie's handsome stranger, a rather dull protagonist.Add reliable veteran performers Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spaceck as Jay's folks, and Treat Williams as the sheriff, this highly capable cast really cooks. Unfortunately it adds up to more of a cold lunch than a holiday feast.Deadfall is a slight and unmemorable thriller, it's laughable in all the wrong ways and doesn't add up to a impressive Thanksgiving themed movie. Although it would be interesting to see what happens after diner, I mean some people have some explaining to do that could have added up to something more interesting than what we have here. This time of year you can do better. Give the gift of love and take some you care about to see something else.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1362441600,2013-03-05

A breath of fresh air, actually.Hope this one makes the cut to move forward.Thanks, Amazon!",1392336000,2014-02-14

3.0,This is a well crafted show with good performances and an okay script.  I made it thru the fifty minutes of this episode but was not intrigued enough to return to it.  I guess I have seen one too many shows like this with a hard boiled detective who is dedicated to doing justice but whose flaws get in the way of his own life.  This is one of the better examples of that genre but I want to see something that reinvents the game.,1391731200,2014-02-07
4.0,"Okay...I had no interest in watching this show before trying it on Amazon Prime.Definitely an adult guilty pleasure if you get the humor in it.  Forget the &#34;adult swim&#34; level animation.

2.0,It was not half as good as some here are rating it.  Must be family members of the cast and or crew.  It was also very boring and lacked any real gore other than a constant pit of dead corpses that look really good considering how long they've been rotting.  I also noticed there were no maggots on the corpses.  HMMMM  My final thought  - Lame-O-Rama.,1403827200,2014-06-27

3.0,"If I rated each episode individually it would be:Waters of mars - 5 stars  By far the best writing of all the episodes in the specials.Planet of the dead- 2 stars (although I will say that the black actor who plays the female general is absolutely superb in her performance.  Anyone know her name?)The end of time (both parts as one episode)- 3 stars.  This isn't as straight forward to rate because it has some parts that are great but for a large part they really weren't written that well.  The guy playing Donna's dad did wonderfully in his performance as always. I really love the master as a character for various reasons- just like the doctor he carries in him much pain and much joy as well (even though that joy is often from inflicting pain on others).  The defeat of the master in a previous episode was much more heartbreaking and dramatic as we saw The doctor suffer right in front of us when he once again became the last time lord.  This time it wasn't nearly as heart wrenching.  Also the saying goodbye of our beloved time lord was so drawn out (it basically started at Planet of the dead and in this episode he reminds us of the premonition every 10 minutes) that it became melodramatic.  Although the last words ""I don't want to go."" were beautiful and very realistic. All in all I found it dissapointing for a finale.",1343347200,2012-07-27

3.0,"I encourage the creators (Matt Shumway and Company)  to continue creating Sci-Fi movies. This Sci-Fi movie had a lot of potential and for an independent film; ""excellent"" set design and good use special effects!However, the ""acting"" delivery of the lines could of been better. It sounded like they were speaking from the script. As an professional actress (who has worked for independent film makers in the San Fran / Bay Area); I can tell by their line delivery.I think there needs to be more rehearsal time and work allowing actors to ""be in the moment"". The quality of the acting could of been a whole lot better. A lot of film makers/ directors totally do not get that.The story writing was ""ok"" but not sure if the intention was to ""cheese out"" towards the end. Also the VIP prisoner ""fight scenes"" did not make sense. If she was that dangerous, she would kill, not think, and move toward her next agenda. So those fight scenes felt empty.The story also seemed rushed. Nothing more captivating than, allowing the audience ""to be in the moment"" considering the films set design supported it.Sci-Fi if done well is one of the most difficult and rewarding art forms an film artist can accomplish. Like Horror; it is also one of the most difficult genres to be successful in.Sci-Fi is one of the most highly desired genres that people seek to watch and if you have the set design then take advantage of the ""environment"" that you have created. Sci-Fi is about tomorrow and the unknown. Its not about being scary; it about humanity and non-humanity in the future.This movie didn't give us any of that. It was a rushed story with no background for us to hold on too.If you look at ""high budget"" TV shows like Stargate SG-1. You will notice that this movie (Enigma) had a great ""Sci-Fi set design"" to work with (similar to big budget Sci-Fi TV shows) and a decent baseline story to work with.Low-budget does NOT = rushing the storyline or trying to finish the film in one day.For the next film you guys make: Please allow actors to fully understand the scene and the environment in which they are working in and also....please put more energy into the ""story"" itself.Lots of promise for you guys to hit it big on the SyFy network one day!!",1403913600,2014-06-28

5.0,"if you got the two Fallout 3 references at the end. So there's nothing new under the sun, right? Although I found myself quoting TV shows and movies more than once for clich&eacute;d dialog. Two in particular, ""If money is all you love, then that's what you'll receive."" Princess Leia to Han Solo as he's about to selfishly ride away when they really need his help. And, ""I knew there was more to you than money!"" Also, Leia and Han. The cool twist (SPOILERS) is it's his daughter who rides back into town with help.Nolan's hero journey is solidly grounded and he's surrounded by a good cast of metaphorical characters to play off. I especially like the sisters. One is the blond, beautiful and kind of innocent mayor and the other is the dark, sultry, definitely not innocent owner (and we are pretty sure Nolan won't have to pay for her services much longer) of the local whorehouse.So, plenty of stories to tell, with plenty of interesting characters play them out. Thank you writers for not hammering us with adolescent angst. Good balance of youth and adult story lines. Did you get the reference the mayor made, with the comment about keeping the trains running? Foreshadowing do you think?From Wikipedia: 'Fascism was really the basis for the New Deal. It was Mussolini's success in Italy, with his government-directed economy, that led the early New Dealers to say 'But Mussolini keeps the trains running on time'Fascism? In Defiance?Although, this show could easily get mired in clich&eacute;s it manages to avoid the fall with the dashing bad-boy with a heart of gold (and a killer smile. we will never tire of that crooked smirk on a handsome face) and his kick-ass adopted daughter.

This is pretty well made, appealing characters, perhaps a bit slow at times, and a very good King like villain in Big Jim. It plows the literary furrow that is King's bread and butter, unusual events that bring out the dark side of everyday life. The picture quality I have to say is great, and the sound as well, I was surprised and pleased to see it available on Prime. Beats watching it on Comcast's VOD with it's mandatory commercials.

A bad investment has cost him, his partners and shareholders their investments and now he wants to save face and still be seen as a brilliant hedge-fund manager.A series of mistakes can cost him his family, his freedom and his money in a matter of days and the elaborate plot unfolds. Can he manipulate the system to save all that he holds dear or will he face the consequences of all of his actions......This is a well written thriller that features multiple actors in the cast that are among the top of their field. It is a very good story about how a man with money can manipulate the system to overcome his serious character flaws and criminal acts.

She offered, and more a detriment to her than him, in my opinion, that he was trying to get out N Africa, but she stopped him by refusing to give a diagnosis of Diphtheria seems unlikely.  Her opinions are most spiteful and mean spirited and shouldn't have been included in the process of making this doc.  She obviously took a great dislike to the man Rommel.  I have known women like her and they are ball busters whose whole purpose is to serve as a Salome' or Jezebel not to mention one of David's wives.  They are bitter hard hearted and headed women, whose sole aim in life is to make men miserable!  They should; to be fair and objective; delete her interviews.  She's an olde crone and is by now roasting in the Fires of Hades for her meanness!

2.0,"The challenge with The After is that I have watched Lost, FlashForward, Invasion, Under the Dome, The X Files, Millennium, etc. This path of a group of random, odd people thrown together when some outside, supernatural force impacts our lives has been done before and a show must execute perfectly on the concept to not feel stale. This felt stale and uneven. It was interesting not knowing what was going on, but there were a ton of logic flaws with how things were being handled. The chaos outside of the parking garage seemed contrived and unbelievable. Had a day already past without communications, there would have been better organization and people would not have been walking around like zombies. It made for a nice visual picture, but was unbelievable. Also, if a day had past outside, why was it never addressed again? Shouldn't more time have past when our protagonist returned to the garage? The acting was good and the show looked spectacular, but the story needs help. It will either veer into the corny, logic problem realm, in which case I will watch one more episode and be done OR it will pull itself together and take us on a nice ride. Lets hope it is the latter.",1392768000,2014-02-19
4.0,This is a fun show to watch. It is the same kind of show as Prison Break or 24. Very suspenseful and eventful.,1369612800,2013-05-27

5.0,"Watch Breaking Bad from season 1 all the way through to get full enjoyment of it.  The character development is so subtle and wonderfully done that I am in awe.  This final season literally left me breathless, staring at the screen with my mouth hanging open, Ozymandias in particular.  REMARKABLE stuff!!",1385164800,2013-11-23
3.0,"Classic sf concept, pretty good actors, but the writers have zero understanding of tactical combat.  Characters continually do spectacularly stupid things, and some of the plot lines are insultingly dumb.  Chinese team taking over super secret super secure headquarters?  Sure.  Such cliche, boring, & dumb writing takes most of the fun out of the series.",1394323200,2014-03-09
4.0,"A well-acted series, to be certain. Ron Perlman seems to be forcing his role somewhat, starting in Season 4 and running into Season 5, but the other actors are well embedded into their roles. A lot of action, and the dialog is realistic. However, the law enforcement types are not as &#34;nimble&#34; as they could be, allowing for the Sons of Anarchy to run rampant over local, state and federal laws, encouraged by a bunch of misfit Feds and more. The MCs themselves are portrayed rather realistically... there is a great deal of violence and gratuitous sex that truly does not further the storyline, going overboard. This does detract from the overall enjoyment of the series. Definitely NOT family fare...",1388275200,2013-12-29
5.0,The guy who is cast as the 'alien in charge' does great acting.  Supporting cast all do a great job.  The kids do even better.  Very quirky and different.  I highly recommend this show.,1355961600,2012-12-20

1.0,"Honestly, I should have paid better attention to the 1-star reviews. I love both Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, which is why I feel terrible for what I'm about what I'm about to say: It was painful to watch. There wasn't anything even remotely laugh-worthy. I watched the entire movie hoping that there would be some redeeming qualities, but sadly - there were none. I honestly hate to say this, but please don't waste your time. I'm doing you a favor!",1405641600,2014-07-18

2.0,"I gave this series two stars to be kind.  It has very little if any redeeming value to it.  Those that like to see borderline pornography may enjoy he series but I am not one of those people.

3.0,"I love reality tv and this is great reality tv because the people are so over the top. There were times where my husband looked at me and said this cannot be real, people are not really this way right?  And then later he said wow I think they are real.  You just can't make this stuff up!  It seriously feels like watching a demolition derby train wreck spectacular.Intermixed is some pretty dancing too. The things the girls can do with their bodies is pretty phenomenal too.",1360454400,2013-02-10
4.0,"I was surprised and delighted with this excellent Norwegian riff on the ""found footage"" genre.  This time we have all the clips from a student's documentary on trolls put in chronologically order.  Shot in verit&eacute; style in the vein of films like CLOVERFIELD, TROLLHUNTER follows three persistent Norwegian film students as they travel to a remote mountain region in hopes of capturing a real-life troll on camera - a creature whose existence has been understandably covered up for decades by the local government.  They claim there's nothing to worry about - it's just a problem with bears making trouble in the more remote mountains and forests of Norway.  Yes, there have been attacks.  Local hunters and the film students' don't believe the disinformation and their determination pays off when they stalk a shadowy poacher and finally get him to agree to let them record his hunt, their encounters wit the fearsome giants and the troll hunter's heroics.This is the coolest monster movie I've seen in a long time.  Having to read the English subtitles while listening to the Norwegian sound track only added to the verisimilitude.  The beautiful cinematography makes ample use of strikingly beautiful, sometimes frozen, Norwegian locations.This entertaining and sometimes funny movie was written and directed by Andr&eacute; vredal.  Although everyone, including Andr&eacute;, is an unknown to US audiences, I understand the Otto Jespersen, the wonderful actor who plays the dour troll hunter, is a well-known satiric comedian in Norway.  The creature effects are top-notch and I even felt kind of sorry for the fearsome, deformed, gigantic, dumb, mutant trolls who are the last of their mythic breed.Among the several extras including a director's commentary, there's an interesting but too brief but fascinating featurette that shows the steps and ""wire frame"" schematics required to insert the seamless lumbering, fearsome, pitiable, digital trolls into the action.",1319328000,2011-10-23
5.0,"Yeh, Mary was off her game. It was predictable after the comments of her growing boobs and increased appetite. I have been to Pennsylvania and been to Intercourse among a few other towns with hilarious names. I love this show. It has so much imagination; with every conceivable situation.",1336694400,2012-05-11
3.0,Project runway is an advertising reality TV show about fashion. The episodes are scripted as are the judges' comments and indeed all of the dialogue and drama. It exists mainly to promote fashion products with the illusion of huge prizes. It's basically a chick show abounding with fantasy.,1382486400,2013-10-23
4.0,"While I LOVE Castle and have watched every episode I am really not liking the DC job thing that is going on, so far they have cut out a chunk of the cast and replaced them with unlikeable characters.  The stories are too NCIS and little humor that has been a large part of the show's appeal.I do understand that perhaps the NY cop situation needed some new blood or something, this is not working for me and I hope they go back to the old backdrop soon, I don't care for DC in real life, why would I want more of it in my entertainment.Castle and Beckett are still great but without the talented cast they had backing them up (not the boring/unlikeable current DC players) I don't know if they can keep the audience to keep going for another season.",1381190400,2013-10-08
5.0,This is one of the best series I've seen.  It's great to watch the streaming so I can watch episodes when I want.  The premise is different from all the usual cop shows.  The acting is good.  I like the characters.  Each episode has a complete case plus something is added to the backstory.,1370390400,2013-06-05

5.0,"Zen is an Italian detective show with the dialog in English, produced by the usual cast of European studios one finds turning out BBC/PBS shows. These are not fast action shoot-em-ups but more along the line of an Inspector Morse&#8212;there are actual crimes to be solved. What makes this short series stand out are the Italian sensibilities of the show; much different from a British police procedural, and refreshingly so. Every one is dirty&#8212;the cops, the politicians, the people in the street&#8212;but they still manage to live life with passion and a sense of style. When a new secretary (Caterina Murino) arrives at the police department the first thing the detectives do is start an office pool betting on who will bed her first. Aurelio Zen (Rufus Sewell), the lead character, tries to maintain his sense of integrity but the system is so corrupt that he gets credit for sabotaging his rivals in the police department when he actually did not (they tripped themselves up). The worst thing about Zen is that they only made these three episodes.",1384905600,2013-11-20

4.0,"Little Britain can be insanely funny though a few of the recurring characters get revisited a tad too often for me.  I tend to watch series online or by DVD so I get them in clumps which is a great way to watch serial shows but can make skit shows less funny over a marathon.  When you first watch you may find the narrator's voice to be familiar, Tom Baker does voice over work here in the US and he was one of the The Doctors.  The leads/writers are brilliant and if you watch the DVD then view the extras, Lucas in particular is an interesting person.  Walliams swam the Channel for charity.",1388793600,2014-01-04

5.0,"The brilliant Agatha Christie's &#34;Poirot&#34; and David Suchet were made for each other! They started out as great and grew into fabulous, as did Christie's characters. Suchet makes the formerly somewhat stuffy Poirot, especially as depicted in old movies, not as endearing as he is in these Masterpiece Theatre creations which make you want to invite this little man into your home and watch his &#34;little gray cells&#34; go to work. The series just gets better and better. My third wish is that it could go on forever. it is so good.",1393632000,2014-03-01

4.0,There are many shows out there that seem very much the same but I can't say the same for this one. I don't watch as much television because shows don't hold my attention for long and I am not sure where this one will go but so far I can't wait for the next season. So these people got isolated from their surrounding by some strange dome which appeared out of nowhere with no warning. Sometimes I am not sure about the supernatural parts of it but not to where I want to turn away from it. The cast of characters is interesting as their story unfolds and skeletons come out of the closet. Not sure if this is a good vs. evil kind of thing or some kind of moral test of the characters but so far I like it.,1390089600,2014-01-19

5.0,You are not going to be reading a book and watching Blacklist at the same time and think you are going to understand anything that's going on. Its a fairly simple core plot but it's the plot twists that make this one of the most original shows Ive seen in years.

5.0,"As someone about 3 weeks older than JFK, Jr, so I don't remember any of this happening in real time.  I would like to believe that this, more than any other documentary, was more evenly balanced.  It showed the POTUS at times very vulnerable and it showed Oswald as a man struggling with his inner demons, but also one who truly loved his wife and children.  We all have a &#34;picture&#34; of what we think Oswald was, because of what history says he did, but this showed the other side of both men.",1397865600,2014-04-19

5.0,"Fair warning up front this will contain spoilers from the prior seasons of the show, but no major season 4 giveaways.  Proceed with caution if you have not seen the others yet.The fourth season can really almost be considered an extension of season 3.  It is only 6 episodes long, and ties up the various loose ends that were left at the end of season 3.  The season starts out with Nikita on the run, wanted for murdering the president.  The remnants of Division are tracking her even though she abandoned them &#34;for their own good.&#34;  The last handful of episodes are really an attempt to clear her name, and take down Amanda once and for all.Overall I think the series ended when it should have.  It was easily the kind of series that could have gone stale if left on the air too long.  While I think they certainly could have got a full run of 22-24 episodes out of the season, there were not many more stories to be told in a Heroes vs Amanda storyline.  Like is the case with prior seasons there are twists in this one.  Not as many as in the full seasons for obvious reasons, but throughout the season not all is what it seems.  The show is ultimately brought to a satisfying conclusion, and even though not everyone makes it out unscathed, it does bring the series a sense of closure and puts each character in a believable place at the end.For those who get the blu ray (because Amazon lumps all the reviews together), it is a no frills all six episodes on one disc presentation.  There are no extras like in previous seasons.  Not even deleted scenes.  Pretty much all you get is the episodes and captions.  The A/V quality of the disc is very good however.  But if you only get the discs for extras then you may just want to go with the online streaming.",1400630400,2014-05-21

5.0,"An old story that has been done redone and well you know. Then this reincarnation of the classic terrible team from hell that can't win. Let us cheer for the under dog one more time. Oh please. not again, I know this story and I am going to throw my monitor across the room, I just know it! Well I lived in L.A. for twenty five years before moving to New York City and I grew up a mile from the football hale of fame and I cheered the Browns on for, well, ever. So out of nostalgia I braved this pilot. Wow! I enjoyed it, it was really ...good. The talent and direction were flawless. Not everyone understands just how critical the director is to a show. A director, at best conducts, sets the tempo, the dynamics, the energy and director Jay Chandrasekhar scores a touch down and two points with this film. writers Jon Weinbach and Jeremy Garelick stepped through the mine field of this genre and did a fantastic job of developing these characters in a sharp crisp manner that made the maximum use of the limit time allotted for a pilot. This team, writers, director and actors, marched down the field with first down after first down throwing one spiral pass after another to score again and again, they made me like and root for them. Kudos go to casting director Wendy O'Brien for putting this well balanced cast on the roster, VIP to her! I predict the actor who plays Danny will be a force in acting for many years to come, I tried to find his name but it doesn't appear to be listed by role, it must be in the opening credits but if you don't know then that is just a list of names without faces! please list by role I am an old guy I can't keep up with all these new faces.

3.0,"My kids (10 & 14) picked this pilot to watch with me. The cover picture looked interesting....sadly that's where it ends. The kids got bored & didn't stick around to watch the rest of the pilot. I think it's too ""wordy"". I almost wanted to ffwd to see what happens next. I got bored too. Not sure if this pilot is going to be animated or not, but I think it would flop if it was animated. Keep it real :) It has potential to be successful, because both boys AND girls can relate. I think the alien is the star of the show (and will get the most laughs). They should change the name. I mean ""Anne"" is kinda dull. I can't see kids (especially boys),bragging at school about ""ANNEbots"". Maybe something more cool sounding, or alien related would be a better title. Something more catchy than ""ANNE"".  blah. The show needs more goofy humor & less wordy nerdy dialogue. The science experiments can be cool & interesting (and safe to do at home), but it needs to move at a quicker pace. Lose the name ANNE, edit the wordy lines, pick up the pace & make the alien the star. Combine the science WITH adventure. Think on the lines of Sandlot Kids & Little Rascals.  Has the potential to be a hit....but needs more work.",1367539200,2013-05-03

5.0,"The complicated life of Walt Longmire, the Sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming, gets even more complicated in Season Two of a terrific series.  However, Longmire, an old-fashioned lawman with heart and grit, will have nothing to do with quit.  The audience will be treated to some excellent television drama in thirteen episodes plus some special featurettes.  And the show returns all of an outstanding cast.Several narrative arcs dominate the season.  One is Walt's battle for re-election with his ambitious deputy Branch Connally, who will tempted more than once to bend the rules to win, until it threatens the life of the woman he loves.  A second is an ongoing police investigation in Denver, run by a ruthless and tireless detective, which will overshadow Walt and best friend Henry Standing Bear by season's end. A third arc involves a man from deputy Vic Moretti's past, a relentless stalker willing to play hardball.  Somewhat, Walt Longmire will have to find a way to keep solving crimes in his county despite all the distractions.The writers have done a great job with Season Two.  The characters get deeper and more interesting.  Even the Ferg, Walt's youngest deputy, gets some quality screentime.

3.0,"I think the idea is cute but there seemed to be too much going on for my 2 year old to get and maintain interest in the program. Also, although the music used for the opening credits is great for the opening credits I think if you were to continue with development of the show you'd want to do a more toned down version of the music throughout the show as opposed to playing the full blown version. I only say that because it's a very &#34;busy&#34; song to play several times throughout a 20 or so minute segment and not have it be off putting. Also the transition between getting to know the characters and doing the creative ideas should be more seamless so it does feel like it's jumping from this to that to that. I think it was hard for her (my daughter) to grasp what was going on because the continuity wasn't quite there.

And, overall, worth checking out.There's not much I could say about it that wouldn't ruin plot points and all, yet I didn't see the first movie, though I did enjoy how this one went.So, the best I could do is a recommendation: if you like fast action, a great-paced movie, a foreign film, numerous twists and deep thought to the twists, and realistic fight scenes, and an eventual cast of eccentric people (including a woman who knows how to fight with her hair as a deadly whip) in the mix and a surprise twist at the end, this could definitely be for you.",1368144000,2013-05-10

2.0,"Paul W. S. Anderson's &#34;Pompeii&#34; is a throwback to all those sword-and- sandal epics of yesteryear that combined period-piece spectacle with generous dollops of bloodletting, action and romance. This 1st Century soap opera just happens to take place in the shadow of Vesuvius, the volcano that famously erupted in 79 A.D., burying much of the city and its inhabitants in tombs of molten rock and ash.Looking like he barely needed a change of wardrobe from his day job, &#34;Game of Throne's&#34; Kit Harrington plays Milo, a Celtic boy who, after he witnesses his family being slaughtered by Roman troops in the northernmost region of the empire, is forced into slavery and raised to become a gladiator. When he's brought to Pompeii to fight in the arena, he catches the eye of Cassia (Emily Browning), a thoroughly anachronistic, sassy, forward-looking, freethinking type who finds the officials in Rome to be all uncouth barbarians and who has no taste for such popular blood-soaked pastimes as fight-to-the-death battles in the coliseum. A ludicrously miscast Keifer Sutherland plays a foul Roman senator who tries to come between the noble woman and the slave.As befits the genre, &#34;Pompeii&#34; is just chockablock with stock characters, cheesy dialogue and corny plotting, though the movie does earn a few points for its unlikely and, dare I say it, even quite brave finale.But, of course, anyone who checks out &#34;Pompeii&#34; will be doing so strictly to witness, albeit vicariously, all the death and destruction visited upon the city and its thousands of inhabitants when Vesuvius finally blows its top. Apparently, overproduced, CGI-infested disaster movies are our milder, modern-day equivalent to gladiatorial contests. And in that respect, at least, the movie delivers the goods.There's one thing that &#34;Pompeii,&#34; fortunately, doesn't have in common with those toga-wrapped spectacles of the past - and that is their extraordinary length. So clocking in at a relatively brief 104 minutes, &#34;Pompeii&#34; has at least one thing going for it.",1402963200,2014-06-17

1.0,"&#34;Transparent&#34; is 1 of 2 of the new Prime series that attempts to combine a cutting edge topic with drama and way too much sex. I guessed from the beginning what the title referred to but that was not a turn off. Instead, it was just one twisted bad acted mess after another.

4.0,"There are a number of improbabilities and gaps in this plot. For one thing, I don&#8217;t think forensic voice recognition programs are nearly as precise and targeting as they are represented as being in this drama. What&#8217;s more, the ending is likely to strike viewers as being too generic and unlikely.Nevertheless, the plot set-up is gripping. I identified with the District Attorney&#8217;s dilemma from the start. In a bonus feature interview, co-star Samuel L. Jackson says that this movie project interested him because it promised to be everything he seeks when he himself goes to the movies. It promised to be entertaining, to take you out of yourself and put you directly in the plight of the characters in the movie, to challenge you afterwards to consider what YOU would have done in the same set of circumstances, and, as a bonus, to provide a sort of moral. The movie delivered for me on all those points.What&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s the added attraction of Gloria Reuben&#8217;s outstanding performance as a police detective. She does a wonderful job of showing the guarded suspicions her character has about what&#8217;s really going on. If I were guilty, I&#8217;d get chills from just her look. Her piercing gaze suggests to me that she knows &#8211; and that she knows I know she knows&#8230; Who&#8217;s going to make the next move?",1395446400,2014-03-22

3.0,"Summary:  A group of 100 kids comprised solely of criminals are sent to the earth to see if it is survivable.The premise is really interesting.  It is really cool that a bunch of kids are sent down to see if the earth is survivable.  It stays cool as long as you don't think about it too hard.Darn, I started thinking.  While this is a cool setup for a start of a new series, the problems with this premise abound.Let us start out with the very initial part of the premise, the space stations.  There was a deliberate vagueness about how the people came to be in the space stations.  If it was done on purpose, they would have laid in an adequate supply of back up parts.  They would have also provided ships with sufficient fuel to ferry the survivors back to the planet.  All of these supplies would have taken up a lot of room, which would limit the number of people allowed on the ship.  There was every indication that people would have been sent purposefully to the arks, since food, medicine, and other essential supplies would have run out long ago.  Another interesting aspect was reproduction and old age.  Reproduction was vaguely touched upon.  It was obvious that each family was limited to one child.  It was also obvious that due to a limitation of supplies that a sick child or a child born with a genetic anomaly would not be allowed to live.  What wasn't so obvious was that these parents could not be allowed to further reproduce.  In a closed system, any genetic mutations could have serious repercussions for the system as a whole.  It was also obvious that adults would have an expiration date.  Old age is a suck on resources just like illness.  The reality is that they could have spent a little more time on the ship, and this would have been a much cooler story.There were also problems that were not touched upon.  Let us start with gravity. Artificial gravity fields take a lot of power to create, and since they do want to return to earth, they would have to make fields that were comparable to earth.  Also, it would be essentially for bone development and growth in their children.  Radiation would also be a problem.  What protects the earth from ionizing and nonionizing radiation that is present in space?  Can you say ozone layer.  While there would be some protection rendered because the ark is still in the upper atmosphere.  The ozone layer would be unlikely to afford much protection-because the space stations would be outside of it.  No protection from the ozone means that this people are daily exposed to radiation from the sun and space.  They would have been more protected on the earth in a hole in the ground.  While these arks are a cool idea, they have a lot of limitations.  You can see why they would want to be vague about living in an ark in space.We find out that this mission is essential to assess the feasibility of returning to earth.  If the earth isn't survivable, the leadership on the ark will have to make decisions about who will be culled/killed so that the ark will still be able to support life.  Hmmm.... their decision is to send a bunch of kids who are largely comprised of untrained criminals.  They send no supplies with them and no means of communication.  That is such an excellent idea (sarcasm font).  They are provided no Geiger counters or meters to measure ionizing radiation.  Just because you aren't immediately losing your hair doesn't mean the radiation levels are safe.  They have no food and no weapons, and they have no immediate means of acquiring them.  They are directed to an old bunker, but after 97 years, there is no way to ascertain if the supplies are still viable, accessible, or even present.  Let's be honest, only in fiction would you send a team that is untrained and doesn't have the best interests of their community as a motivator to succeed on a mission.  This scenario lacks plausibility.  The show is designed to appeal to young viewers.  It is not designed to be plausible.  It is also designed to have many opportunities for young angst.The question you have to ask yourself is did the show have to be so stupid just to appeal to young viewers.  Ultimately, the answer would be no.  They knew that they had an insufficient number of pods for the population.  This would immediately remove the right of anyone over reproductive age of going, so this would make the cut-off probably around 35.  That would really be tough, but here comes the tougher part, the really young would also not be able to go.  If you are in a hostile land, small, crying children would be very dangerous.  This would make it unlikely that anyone 5 or under would be going.  It would also be likely that their parents would not be going as well due to their unwillingness to leave their small children.  And there is your 1200 people.They could have still had young people in the initial party, but they wanted to set up a scenario where there was a lot of mayhem.Here is the problem, mayhem and angst will only take a show so far, especially a show like this.  After a while, it starts to fizzle because you will only be left with the same mayhem and angst, and warring with the natives gets old fast.So they landed with no food, weapons, or helpful technology into a hostile world that appears to be rife with mutations.  Umm... if there were this many mutations in just a hundred years, it is likely that there is still a LOT of radiation.  Also, if mammals like deer are mutated, you would also be seeing mutations in humans.  You would also be seeing a LOT of new viruses and bacteria to which the little ark kids would have no immunity.  Oops, just another thing that was not addressed.Maybe the writers will be able to come up with a lot of new exciting scenarios to keep their audience transfixed, but honestly, I was starting to get very bored of the show.  By the time it had ended this season, it held no more excitement than the pilgrims coming to America and trying to survive.  And truly, the reason outlined for the fighting just felt forced.  Your ship killed some of our people.  I also am getting really tired of their romantic angst.",1404604800,2014-07-06

5.0,"INTO THE WHITE, also known as CROSS OF HONOR, is based on fact and in adapting the facts to the screen director Petter Nss along with co-writers Ole Meldgaard and Dave Mango have turned out a film that could easily have been a stage play, restricted for the most part as it is to the confines on one cabin. But then the vast beauty of the Norwegian landscape would have been sacrificed and it is that use of the bleak snow clad solitude that underlines the effects of isolation on the human response and survival under austere conditions.On April 27, 1940, while the Germans and the British were struggling to gain control of Norway's vast natural resource to aid their war efforts two enemy fighter planes were shot down over the tundra of Norway. We meet the German soldiers first - Lieutenant Horst Schopis (Florian Lukas), Feldwebel Wolfgang Strunk (Stig Henrik Hoff) and the wounded Unteroffizier Josef Schwartz (David Kross) as they struggle for survival, sleeping in snow caves and finally fining a deserted one room cabin where they settle in without much food and little comforts. Next we meet the British crew of the plane that crashed in the conflict with the Germans - Captain Charles P. Davenport (Lachlan Nieboer) and Gunner Robert Smith (Rupert Grint). The Brits find the German held cabin and join the Germans in a hostile relationship: there is a constant struggle of who is in charge, the Geneva convention rules of prisoners of war etc. But gradually the friction diminishes as the five men cope with finding food, warmth, and the care of Josef's arm, which has turned gangrenous. The facades of their military personalities fade into the unique personal needs of each and the result is an improbable friendship laced with angst, philosophy, humor, and mutual caring: in the end we are all equals and `enemies' morph into caring friends.As the credits role at film's end we are informed of the fates of each of the five men. The story is solid, touching, humorous at times, and carries a strong message about what war does to men's minds and It is only when isolated from the `badges of countries' that these unlikely men becomes bonded.  A very strong film. Grady Harp, April 13",1365379200,2013-04-08

The show switched locations to new mexico ,  which isn't that noticeable  Longmire will hopefully continue on and not get short changed like 'the glades' did.  We never got a real ending on that one.  except to think the lead character was dead.  Longmire is well worth watching.

3.0,"As a longtime fan of Stephen King, I went into TV's ""Under the Dome"" with an open mind, knowing ahead of time that many changes would be made to the original story.  What I didn't realize was that the writers' intention was to keep the most basic elements in place, then write an entirely new story that bears only minimal resemblance to the book.  Here's a laundry list of changes that I see an either unnecessary or downright absurd, followed by what I think is good about the show:1.)  Linda Everett from part-time cop married to physician's assistant Rusty Everett, both trapped under the dome,  to Linda Esquivel, Hispanic female police officer in a small Maine town (??) engaged to firefighter Rusty Denton who gets caught outside the dome.2.)  Phil Bushey from zombified meth cook known as the Chef who hides out in an automated religious radio station to a popular contemporary radio DJ with ambiguous ties to the gambling underworld (???).3.)  Junior Rennie from a disturbed, homicidal psychopath with a brain tumor who sleeps with women after he kills them, and who secretly despises his father, to a slightly off-in-the-head, somewhat psychotic, but also sometimes strangely reasonable young man who craves his father's admiration and respect.4.)  Big Jim Rennie from a Christ-driven mini-dictator who never curses to a slightly religious-minded mini-dictator who swears lightly.5.)  Julia Shumway from lifelong small-town newspaper editor to disgraced out-of-towner who scrapes up a job in Chester's Mill.6.)  Thurston Marshall and Carolyn Sturges from a May-December tourist couple who find two young dome-orphans named Alice and Aidan, to Alice and Carolyn Hill, a lesbian couple from L.A. who are in Maine to drop off their daughter, Norrie, at a girl's reformatory.  (?????)7.)  Norrie Calvert from town ""riot grrrl"" who is friends with Joe and Benny to the daughter of the aforementioned lesbian couple.8.)  Dale Barbara from fry cook with a troubled military past to mercenary with a troubled military past who roughs up people with gambling debts.  (??????)9.)  Angie McCain from pot-head waitress at the Sweetbriar who gets murdered by Junior to Angie McCallister, Joe's big sister, who gets locked in the Rennie fall-out shelter by Junior, then becomes Big Jim's blackmail pawn against his son.10.)  Dodee Sanders from pot-head friend of Angie who also gets murdered by Junior to Dodee Weaver, radio sound engineer and co-worker of Phil Bushey who gets murdered by Big Jim for knowing too much.  (?????)11.)  Andrea Grinnell from the town's Third Selectman who makes Big Jim's railroading of Chester's Mill more difficult to concerned citizen who has no importance to the plot.12.)  Pete Randolph from clueless cop promoted to chief to Paul Randolph, crazed deputy who fires shots at the dome and kills one his fellow officers, then leads the town on a manhunt through the woods.13.)  No Andy Sanders (town First Selectman and Big Jim's scapegoat in the book), no Carter, Frank, Mel, and Georgia (the rapist deputies), no Brenda Perkins, no Sammy Bushey, no Reverend Piper Libby, no Romeo Burpee...basically, all subplots from the book eliminated.Those are just some of the character changes, which don't even scratch the surface of the differences in the plot.  For instance, in the most inept stab at a plot twist I've seen on any show, a new character, Maxine, is created.  She's a femme fatale crime kingpin (who looks all of about 25 years old) who gets caught in the Mill, has illicit ties to both Barbie and Big Jim, and begins running a fight club to make money after the dome drops.  Can I just say .... BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Okay, now that I got that out of my system, I'll follow it up with a heaving sigh at the inane butchering of a pretty good book.  As for other changes, you have to ask, was it better in the book, or is the show an improvement?  Take the case of Officer Randolph.  In the book, a young boy drives at the dome on an ATV during a town gathering, shoots it, and blows out his own eye.  That's replaced by Randolph shooting the dome after the town pitches in to put out a fire and accidentally killing another officer.  Personally, I think the book version is more horrific and compelling.Two more quick notes on changes.  One, the death of Reverend Lester Coggins is far more dramatic and intense in the book, with Big Jim and his son teaming up to finish off the meddling minister in their house.  On the show, Rennie smashes Coggins's head into the dome and it's over.  Lame in comparison.  Second, the show offers the source of the dome as a mini-dome with an egg inside that the teens find in the woods, then they carry it around, hide it in barns and friends' bedrooms, find secret magic spots on it that are like keypads for their hands, find a butterfly inside, see the pink falling stars from the book, put sunglasses on it and take it to parties .... okay, that last one was ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" but you get the picture.On the plus side, a handful of actors stand out.  Obviously, Dean Norris as Big Jim is a highlight, Mike Vogel does well as Barbie, and the characters of Julia Shumway and Officer Linda Esquivel are mostly good.  Other than that, though, much of the acting gets annoying, especially the girl playing Norrie Calvert.  The seizure scenes she shares with Scarecrow Joe look like something you'd see in a comedy.  Ridiculous conceits, like Big Jim several times dispersing scared, angry crowds made up of the whole town, by saying things like, ""Everybody go on home and let us take care of things,"" then the crowd just drifts away...these moments pop up frequently.  Political sermonizing, like Carolyn telling a skeptical farmer something like, ""We're a gay couple with a daughter, welcome to the 21st century"" pop up seemingly to push an ulterior agenda and inspire massive eye-rolling.  Only a few of the book's original plot ideas remain in place for this show, and its saving grace is the suspenseful way the plot is presented, making expert use of today's propensity for serialized TV drama.  Also, even though so much of the plot is different from the book, I do find at least more than half of it compelling and suspenseful, such as the showdown between Big Jim and farmer Ollie Dinsmore, Big Jim's complex relationship with his son....actually, now that I think about it, just about all of the plotlines that focus on Big Jim, as Dean Norris is hands-down the best actor in this series.I'll be tuning in and hoping beyond hope that some positive changes are made when Season 2 premieres next summer, but right now, I'm worried that the writers will continue re-imagining so much of the story that they ruin it with droll like the Maxine character and subplot.  If they find a way to right the ship, make the changes work, and bring the story back to some similarity to the book (which I didn't see anything wrong with, anyway), I'll come back and upgrade this review.  Stephen King himself is slated to write Season 2's first episode, so we'll see what happens.",1388620800,2014-01-02
2.0,"This is just a generic, cookie cutter adventure series with the Marvel name slapped on it. The sole connection to the Marvel universe is the character of Coulson, who otherwise brings nothing to the show. There are occasional gratuitous references to the Avengers and the invasion of New York.The rest of the characters are stereotypes and none of the actors are convincing in these roles.

I love Castle and the bantering between Richard Castle, writer, and Beckett, detective. I originally started watch this program because I loved Nathan Fillion in the shows Serenity and Firefly.  This particular episode is about a science fiction convention and how it is discovered that Beckett while in college was heavy into Sci-Fi a particular show, similar to Star Trek.  This episode spoofs Firefly.  I can't tell you the end as it would spoil the hilarity you will enjoy.  So...funny...

5.0,"In its strong third season, NCIS-Los Angeles continues to capitalize on its excellent cast, as the NCIS LA-based Office of Special Projects conducts undercover operations against terrorists, spies, arms-dealers, transnational criminals and other threats to the Department of the Navy.Linda Hunt returns as diminutive and mysterious Operations Manager Hetty Lange, who continues to overawe the agents each week.  The original superb buddy team of Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J as agents G. Callen and Sam Hanna is joined by a second field team, consisting of Agent Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah) and LAPD detective Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen), who are still working on their often hilarious love-hate relationship.  Computer geeks Eric Beale (Barrett Foa) and Nell Jones (Renee Smith) form a third team.  The mysterious Nell seems to have an additional hush-hush role as cat's paw for Hetty, and will materialize on at least one mission brandishing a firearm with unexpected skill.The season opens with the thrilling conclusion to last season's cliffhanger, which had the team on an unauthorized rescue mission in Romania.  The four field agents will attempt to storm a criminal gang's headquarters to rescue Hetty.  In the process, they will have to cope with the manipulations of secretive acting Operations Manager Lauren Hunter (Claire Forlani in a recurring role), who seems to have her own agenda. The fallout of the mission will include, at long last, some shocking insights into the unknown past of Agent Callen, including unsuspected ties to Hetty.  An extended story arc in mid-season will feature a visitation by a sinster assistant director from headquarters, whose purpose will only slowly be revealed, and it won't be good for the team, especially Kensi.  An extended season-ending cliffhanger matches the team against a clever chess-playing villain (and blast from the past) who leaves the team in desperate disarray.""NCIS: Los Angeles"" is highly recommended to NCIS fans as a lighter and hipper version of the original show.  It offers its own exciting weekly storylines.  Its fun emphasis on character interaction will include Kensi's poorly-hidden jealousy over Deeks' relationship with an attractive female Mexican police officer, Sam's hunt for his missing and highly-prized personal classic car, or Nell tempting Eric to ""break the internet.""",1319241600,2011-10-22

5.0,While the finale of the series could be call ambiguous it also left a decent ending that will still leave many fans of the series happy enough so there should be little disgruntlement felt by them.  This season saw the removal of Sam Carter as leader of Atlantis and the Representative of the IOA placed in charge though he isn't the puppet many expect him to be. Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.  While we say goodbye to this sci-fi series which started weak but ended strong a sad farewell you can add this series to your other t.v. show dvd collection to watch again at your leisure and for the price very much worth it....,1349308800,2012-10-04

3.0,"Vikings is a tamer Rome.  (given the station, it is understandable)We will start with the bad:The characters are sometimes hard to follow as they seem to want to try and break the stereotype mold.  The obvious villain stays obvious, but the obvious turncoat(s) turns out good, but then not so, then is so, then not so again.  It made it a little tough to cheer for a character or not.  You feel bad for them one minute, then they completely go against the grain for seemingly no reason.The relationships built between the initial raiding party are hinted at being tight but the show does not bother to explore them and instead uses the raiding party as fodder to fuel other storyline developments.  They work like expendable family members.The fight scenes are just not that good.  You can see the obvious scene stops in each fight sequence and the over-all choreography is just too slow.  The actors seem like they are afraid to actually HIT.  You don't see the &#34;fighting like demons&#34; aspect that is talked about.All of that said...  The Good.The story, for me, was compelling though obvious.  Its an interesting look into the life of Vikings while following a potentially fictitious hero, Ragnar.  (People still debate whether he was real or an amalgam of other Norse heroes)  His son, unlike Carl in the walking dead, is not an insufferable pain to see on screen, and his wife actually adds something to the story.  The customs and legends are great and interesting to follow up on in your spare time.  The acting is pretty good, though Travis Fimmel's facial expressions tend to confuse the situation.  That said, I do like the way he is playing Ragnar.For a first season, it is not bad and I will be tuning in for a second season when it finally drops.  It is not good enough to rave over, or to rush home to see at it's regularly scheduled time slot, but it is good enough to watch start to finish via Prime.  Hopefully the second season will delve a little deeper into the opening sequence and provide a little more of the raiding that is talked about so heavily in the first season.",1389312000,2014-01-10
1.0,"If you do not have ovaries, you will completely miss any appeal this show has, and I hope you are only watching it to get into the pants of someone with ovaries who happens to be a fan.

It is a complete failure even in its attempts mock itself. The actors are all on their way out of the Hollywood meat-grinder and they know it and are not afraid to let the desperation seep into their performances.

5.0,"Well Sandra Oh is leaving the show--Christina is a bit tired I would think after l0 years of Greys Anatomy. The whole show is fabulous and every bit as good as ER was (in the olden days). The show has comedy, pathos, love, hate, good, bad and everything else you wish for in a drama. This last episode, at the very end we find out that Dr. Weber is speaking to a new cardio head and she mentions she was adopted. She had searched for her birth-mother....ELLIS GREY... who happened to be Dr. Weber's love interest throughout his  internship and graduation and a half sister to Meredith - Ellen Pompey who knows not a thing! This lovely woman is African American so Dr. Weber is pretty sure he is the father.This is a real con-um-drum (sp?) and it will be exciting to see it play out.I sobbed through the whole show because Derek has this wonderful job in DC working for the President and heading up his neuro research techniques  while Meredith does not want to move and her favorite friend has gone. This will be interesting and heartwrenching to see how it plays out but all  Seasons in this show are super good.

5.0,"J.J. Abrams has done the impossible by making a Star Trek film for everyone. It will appeal to long time fans (most anyways) and the unintiated alike. What really surprised me is how this is more of a character driven film than one relying just on action and SFX. The casting is outstanding, especially Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. Pine manages to get the essence of Kirk, but not being a parody of William Shatner. He is cocky, yet you know there is intelligence that goes along with his recklessness. Before watching this movie I couldn't think of anyone who combines the looks and smarts to play Spock other than Leonard Nimoy, but Quinto manages to pull it off brilliantly. Karl Urban made a very good Dr. McCoy early on, but they seemed to forget about his character as the movie progressed. The rest of the cast is good, but they are not given that much to do. I just heard on the news that most have signed on for two more movies, so perhaps they will all get their due in future installments. Eric Bana was the weak link here for me. He just wasn't a very intimidating villain. Maybe it was more of the character than his actual acting, but he is not even close to the legend that is Khan. Leonard Nimoy's role was pivotal and not just some cheap cameo, so that was nice.The story, while not mind blowing, is clever enough. For a time travel plot, it is rather easy to follow and I like how they made it an alternate reality to cover up any inconsistencies with the past series.The music (loved how they used the old theme music over the end credits) and SFX are very good as expected. There is also quite a bit of humor that works most of the time. My theater was pretty much full and everyone seemed to be having a good time during and after the movie ended. Star Trek is a well made summer blockbuster that has wide appeal and will likely spawn at least two sequels. So beam up to your local theater and prepare to boldy go where no man has gone before.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1241740800,2009-05-08
3.0,"This is a rather pointless ""horror"" film.A group of 20 somethings are out in the woods, some long distance from the road to clear an area for a large camp site for kids...one you can't reach by car. The cast introduce themselves as a way to quickly build character. As they clear the woods, accidents happen and this thing turns into a ""ten little Indians"" tale for no rhyme or reason.The acting was decent. The dialouge was well written. The plot flowed rather well in spite of some issues, but there was no substance to the story...or maybe I am missing something. Some films are made better by not explaining what happened (Yellow Brick Road), but it didn't work for me in this one. After watching a fairly decent film, I was let down by the ending, the last scene which caused me to laugh (by design). The closeups of the chainsaw showed it didn't have a chain but a serrated blade made to look like chain.The land was donated by a family whose little girl was murdered, which didn't really enter the film. Apparently the land they are on is cursed, but by what and why? Did the girl being killed curse the land or was that because of it? Or was one of the campers cursed or a victim of it? Or was it all fate? The film will need a sequel to explain this one.Parental Guide: F-bombs, near sex, nudity (Grindhouse girl Emmy Robbin)Safety Note: If you have something embedded in you, like a stick, the proper first aid is to stabilize the item and seek medical attention. DO NOT YANK IT OUT. That opens up the hole and causes bleeding. Also the proper way to insert foam ear plugs is to squeeze and roll the end of the plug going in the ear canal, pull the ear back, end then insert it. You don't just jam it in.",1363996800,2013-03-23

4.0,"The actors all did a wonderful job.  It was good to see they didn't simply show Ann Pettway as the villain, too - her action was wrong on many levels, and according to the movie, she still didn't seem to grasp the pain she caused to many, many people.  However, she didn't steal baby Carlina for malicious reasons, or to extract money from her parents, or to torture and/or abuse her.  She stole the baby because she couldn't deal with the loss of another baby through miscarriage, and in her grief and depression - walked out of the hospital with another woman's child to raise and love, and be able to receive a child's love.  As much as her action horrified an angered me, I couldn't help myself, I felt pity for her, as well.I cannot imagine the pain and anguish Joy and Carl went through, during the twenty-three years they were denied their child.  The stolen baby resulted in their inability to remain together as a couple, everyone's life was completely altered by the theft of this child.  I found the replay of Nettie's interview, where she stated she wasn't Nejdra, as that name had been forced on her, and she wasn't Carlina, as that name had been stolen from her - that being Nettie felt right, to be very poignant.My only complaint about the movie would be the final few minutes when they had the &#34;blurbs&#34; posted, giving updates on what has happened since filming... they flashed by so quickly, I didn't get to read them all!  I simply did a quickie Google search then, and read several articles.  I highly recommend this movie.",1392940800,2014-02-21

4.0,"This was a cute romantic comedy.  The characters are likeable and funny.The heroine, Katie, is a typical woman.  She's believable in every way because she isn't model-like beauty and she isn't a damsel in distress bull.  I liked this character very much.The hero, James, was also likeable.  But the writers could have developed his character more.  We don't learn much about why he decided to google about a place for his book.  Why he put so much detail about this Scottish Island called Hegg, calling it beautiful and all these other terms he used from a thesaurus. This book somehow became a bestseller.  And now the poor guy has writer's block.  But he is happy because he's about to marry a world famous actress (think Angelina Jolie).  But this woman doesn't want the press involved and with rightful reasons.  I just didn't really like her though. She comes off as needy and spoiled.The acting in this was great.  It does have an all star cast that bring their own funny little quirks.Kelly MacDonald (Boardwalk Empire: The Complete First Season&Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)) plays the likeable average Katie.  She is both funny and perfect for this role.David Tennant (Doctor Who: The Complete Second Series&Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)) plays James.  Now I liked David.  His romantic side is very likeable.  But I still expected him to lick his lips from time to time like he did in Goblet of Fire (played a bad guy with this lick habit).This movie is an enjoyable romantic comedy to watch if in need for something light and funny.",1350345600,2012-10-16
3.0,"The main reason I rented this was because of Lauren Graham. I have been a fan since following her through all the seasons of The Gilmore Girls, a show that is close to my heart, mainly due to Graham's brilliant performance. Sadly, her movie roles thus far have been rather lackluster, partly because of the secondary roles she has been playing, as in ""Evan Almighty"" and ""Flash of Genius"". In ""Answer Man"", Graham gets to shine a bit more, but I still felt her character deserved more exposure.""Answer Man"" reminds me of ""As Good As It Gets"", only it never quite gets a chance to achieve the brilliance of the latter. Like Jack Nicholson's OCD character, Jeff Daniels plays a quirky and eccentric character. He portrays Arlen Faber, an author whose one book ""Me and God"" created a sensation and became a bestseller, cornering 10% of the ""God"" market. Yet 20 years later, Arlen feels he has not really learned anything nor gained any great insights, so he shuts himself away in his Philadelphia house downtown, living a reclusive life, shunning all his fan mail & interviews, much to the chagrin of his literary agent. Feeling frustrated with all the self-help books that fail to lift his spirits nor grant him any useful perspectives on life, Arlen carts the books away to a used bookstore run by a recovering young alcoholic Kris (Lou Taylor Pucci in a wonderfully nuanced performance), only to be refused (as Kris doesn't have any money to buy Arlen's books). To cut a long story short - Arlen hurts his back and seeks help at a chiropractor's which is owned and operated by single mom Elizabeth (Lauren Graham). The pair start to bond but the relationship is complicated by Arlen's eccentricities and inability to reach out to people who need him and Liz's own personal problems.Meanwhile Kris the recovering alcoholic begins to show up at Arlen's home seeking advice in return for taking some of Arlen's books off his hands.The various story arcs do intersect quite well, but the characters lack sufficient development - so Arlen is seeking answers...but why exactly has he allowed 20 years to pass by, and his whole romance with Graham almost seems contrived at times. Graham's personal problems are alluded to but never fully explored, and her interactions with her seven-year-old son seem unbearably awkward and even a tad fake at times. Pucci's character was the most likable in this movie, in that he elicits the viewer's sympathy and makes one want to root for him in his battle against the bottle, yet even his role seems to lack true depth.""Answer Man"" is interesting and engaged my attention, but it is also quite forgettable. I would certainly recommend it as a rental especially for those who like Lauren Graham, Jeff Daniels, and Lou Taylor Pucci, but it doesn't compare to some real gems like ""As Good As It Gets"".",1259539200,2009-11-30

5.0,Longmire is a unique western flavored modern day cop/mystery show that really develops the characters. Sheriff Longmire is an enigmatic character that is modern with a touch of the old cowboy spirit and ethics. He has the soul of a native american and it comes to light in odd ways.Every show has a really good mystery and it has taken two seasons to really show Longmire's mysterious dark secret. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Longmire's best friend. His character is as interesting as Longmire's. The whole cast is great.The writers of Longmire really know how to develop a story and keep you engaged. I've thanked my friend many times for recommending this show. By the way... This is a very adult show and not for young children.,1396569600,2014-04-04

5.0,"*My husband and I had just caught up with all the past shows on White Collar and were twiddling our thumbs wondering what we could watch together. Nothing violent or gorey (my preference) and nothing too cutesy or overly romantic (his preference). This fits the bill!I I was 'iffy' with the pilot but liked the main character well enough to give it a second chance. I am glad I did. My husband and I both enjoy this show-it's funny, interesting and the characters are very engaging! Very little blood or gore-great for me since I am squeamish and don't typically watch 'doctor shows' becuase they are too graphic. This is just well-written and fun to watch! So far, nothing offense.

5.0,"Don't be fooled - this is NOT the new Teen Titans. Not that there was anything wrong with that show, mind, but this program is decidedly not geared solely toward the younger generation. This is true despite the fact that it revolves around teenaged superheroes. For one thing, the adult Justice League is never far away from the action. Batman makes frequent appearances, Black Canary is the team's trainer, Captain Marvel is practically a member, and there's a slew of cameos by virtually every other prominent hero in the DC universe (and quite a few of the lesser-known ones). So if you were disappointed that ""Justice League Unlimited"" was being replaced by a show with a younger cast of characters, don't be.Unlike many other shows featuring teenaged characters, Young Justice actually makes good on its promise to show growth and character development in its cast. We see these kids struggling with realistic, believable issues as they seek to become worthy of the Justice League. Yes, there is some romance, but it's handled in a refreshingly subtle fashion. The humor is almost always spot-on. And aside from the characters, the plot is incredible. There's a strong emphasis on an overall story arc in which the stakes get higher every week - especially as we learn that nearly all our beloved young heroes have big secrets. There's an air of darkness to Young Justice, though I wouldn't say it ever quite gets oppressive enough to cost the show its family-friendly label. The drama is quickly building towards a climax that will shake the whole universe in which the show is based. So I recommend you start catching up now - you won't be sorry.",1334275200,2012-04-13
2.0,"I have issues with monster movies where the female lead is always dressed and looking sexy tousled, her hair and face just so, even as she sweats her way from one near-death to another. That was the funny part for me. I laughed. There is no chemistry between these two as they try to make their way home to the US from the alien-infected jungles of Mexico. Yes, the movie tries to make a social commentary about immigration and keeping the Mexicans out. Here, a huge wall is there to keep the aliens out, unsuccessfully, it turns out. I'll credit the film with not overdoing the scares. There is more threat of scare than actual scare. The aliens looks like giant shrimp, and while not entirely believable, they look okay for cheap special effects. The other effects are better, such as the wreckage left behind where the aliens have been rampaging. The script stinks, and the two lead actors are bad. Should you watch? Maybe. Just don't expect much.",1332201600,2012-03-20
5.0,"Having watched every episode of Burn Notice, my wife and I, along with several friends and family members, are completely hooked.In a way this show reminds me of another series we thoroughly enjoyed 20 years ago, Stingray. Although Stingray was completely under the radar, and Michael is always blip number one, there are still similarities. Michael's skill at going undercover and improvising a role comes to mind. Also, Stingray's stories were a trade in 'favors', and Michael and friends often help someone as a favor, or for only expenses. Both had secretive but evidently quite successful histories in secret ops.One of the things I enjoy most about Burn Notice are the little 'spy tips' that grace every show. Some of them make sense, some are utter nonsense, and some of them I'm not too sure about, but they're all fun.Another thing I like about it is the way in which the 'bad guys' often come to grief in very satisfying, often funny ways. The late 2nd season episode where Michael foils a bank robbery is hilarious.Whether it makes sense all the time or not, obviously the writers of this show care, and are putting a good effort into each script. That makes up for any sins and makes for a quite entertaining show.Season One obviously contains the ""origin story"" in the pilot, which is a big advantage. However, this series is remarkably consistent throughout its run, and all the episodes are of very consistent quality as well. Although there have been a few stand out shows that I particularly enjoyed, I can't really think of any ""stinkers"" that I had to overlook. USA Network just keeps coming out with many of the most entertaining shows on TV over the last few years, and Burn Notice is part of that group.",1276992000,2010-06-20

1.0,"Much of the current cast is unlikable: the two new ones are 1) crazy, and 2) bland; and I would like to see the pretentious and over-bearing Heather booted as well; her arrogance and sense of entitlement has become incredibly annoying. I think Heather has exerted too much influence over this show because she is Jewish and so are the show's producers, and that is one tribe that sticks together. Heather pretends to a kind amiable character that she does not possess; she has now twice kicked another cast member out of her house when her or her husband's comments rebounded back on them (and who can forget the infamous ""intervention"" Heather staged when she viscously blindsided Alexis while on vacation). I miss Alexis too; maybe she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but she had a good heart (more than can be said of Heather), and Alexis is the greatest beauty that has appeared on any of these house wife shows. I think her beauty is why Heather was so jealous of her; that, and the fact that she is pointedly Christian and Heather is Jewish. I strongly suspect that Heather had Alexis blacklisted. Apart from being eye candy, it was fascinating to watch as Alexis fought for parity in her marriage. They should bring Alexis back. I don't think I can stand another season of Shannon; she is bat s*** crazy (0f course, I'm sure Heather will have her fired anyway). The other new one is just a bland version of Alexis, who knuckles down to Heather (as much of the cast is now doing...where are Tamara's smart aleck wisecracks?  She keeps her mouth shut because she's scared of Heather and of the power she wields over the show). I don't think I'm going to continue to watch with the current cast. Besides, they are so scared of Heather that they cannot be themselves.",1402790400,2014-06-15

Reminiscent of &#34;HOUSE&#34;, I see a lot of parallels (scruffy beard, drug use, arrogance, inspiration (often the final clue to the mystery) from his associate(s), and general genius) which I enjoy immensely.  I had the opportunity to watch the Pilot and early episodes again.  Watson (I LOVE Lucy Liu) was a little rough in the beginning -- but it takes time to establish the chemistry.  They are a PERFECT pair now.  These are very well (but not perfectly) thought out mysteries and Holmes, Watson, Gregson, and Bell all work amazing well together.  Two words: WATCH IT!

3.0,"I caught this film as a free sneak peak on HDNET in my home theater a week or so ago and it does seem to play better on a big screen. For a film called ""Monsters"", this film shows very little of them. This may have helped the film to created some atmosphere when the land roaming octopus with squid like tentacles is shown, but the acting and dialogue aren't good enough to carry the film. I wasn't a big fan of 'Cloverfield because they used the POV camera in ways that didn't seem natural and if they had used the POV camera in that film like they did here, it would have been a better movie. The POV camera works, when used as a tool and not the sole viewpoint in a film. A good example of this is 'Quarantine or {REC}.I did like the atmosphere when the monsters are on screen as there is a haunting quality about these huge things. For there size they didn't make much noise and they seem to come out of the black sky eerily! It's effective, but where a film like 'District 9' had too much over the top mayhem, this film is a little too tame. I think it's a film worth seeing, but it isn't anything I would watch more than twice. I think that horror and sci-fi films like all the films I mentioned above(including this film)are all worthy entries in the two genres as they are taking a new avenue to the classic atmospheric tales that scared me as a kid, rather than just being gory or full of jolt shocks to make up for lack of story.",1289952000,2010-11-17

5.0,"Journeyman is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the BEST television shows ever produced. The concept of Journeyman is brilliant, the marketing was abysmal, the ratings were satisfactory for a freshman show, the over-all quality of Journeyman is superb. But don't think Journeyman is just a show about time travel. It's so much more. Journeyman is a show about a heroes. Dan Vasser is the hero who goes back in time to help right wrongs. Livia is his hero partner who helps him. Katie Vasser is his hero wife who, through no fault of her own, finds herself married to a time-traveling man who, coincidently is time traveling with his ex-girlfriend. This show could have taken so many low roads with this issue. But never once did it slip into the little nasty things other shows use to pull people in - illicit sex, bad language, drug addiction. Journeyman was one of the few shows in many years that showed humanity at its best. We need MORE shows like this, not less. Why NBC canceled Journeyman is a mystery to many, many fans who continue to proliferate all over the internet, months after this show was canceled. I say to NBC: remember Star Trek? Now, FOX owns the rights to this show. We can hope that Fox does a better job and has more respect for this diamond of a show that got coal treatment. For the fans of Journeyman, WE were the ones who lost. But NBC? They deserve to be in fourth place amongst the networks. They are the real losers here.

5.0,"Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut, and the glossy, well-made series looks wonderful in the format.  Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.  Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us.  Spectacular, and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it's first season run.",1232236800,2009-01-18
5.0,"I had gotten season 1 & debated about getting any other seasons. The show was very well done but the character of Bones was very irritating as she was clueless to everyday life, & only spoke & related to things in scientific terms. (I realize this was the ""joke"" of the show but it was really annoying to me.)  Friends told me that it got better as the seasons progressed.I got season 3 BEFORE getting season 2, as I didn't think it would make much of a difference (& it was cheaper at the time too). My friends were right, Bones isn't anywhere near as annoying as she was in season 1, she's more normal.  The only thing with jumping from season 1 to season 3, apparently I missed a LOT in season 2. There are (now) new characters (Booth apparently has a history with one of them) & there are many new story lines. Season 3, I find out Bones' father (played by Ryan O'Neal) was arrested in season 2 by Booth. There are other story lines I need to get caught up on as well from season 2.The show is very well done, although the corpses are rather gross & disgusting - and sometimes they are way too graphic. There are several extras on this DVD & there ARE subtitles for the hearing impaired.  Also, this DVD set has a ""bonus"" of the first 4 episodes from season 4.  I have ordered season 2 (so I can see what I missed). Season 3 is MUCH BETTER than season 1.",1395446400,2014-03-22

3.0,"So, I like the combo pack distribution method. You get both the Blu & the DVD in one simple package. Good stuff.It comes with basically one special feature, an AMEX sponsored ""behind the scenes"" featurette. Other than that' it's just the movie, and maybe a few trailers for other movies.That said, the movie itself was pretty middlin'. Not great, not terrible. But, in the end it really didn't amount to anything. Backstory was vaguely interesting. Supposedly some evil things dwells in a hollow tree and causes people to commit suicide, or something?You never actually see the supposed ""thing."" As with so many ""found footage"" films, it's just a bunch of people running around screaming about things you never actually. But it's in the dark so it's a little creepy. You keep expecting something to jump out of the dark and go ""Boo!"" Sadly, the only thing going ""Boooo..."" is the audience. Nothing ever really happens... The backstory isn't ever entirely explained, the characters are kind of boring. There are lots of shots of nothing. Like watching the windshield wipers, or pointing the camera at seagulls, or pointing the camera at the ground while walking (or running screaming). There seem to be a number of ""cinematic transitions"" that have no real explanation within the bounds of ""how a handheld camera works."" So, either the 'police' 'edited' the video to make it more interesting, or well obviously it's a 'movie.'In the end, there was just too little going on, too many scenes of nothing interesting going on and no explanation for everything that happened and you never actually SEE anything scary it's all just the psychological terror of running around in the dark and THINKING you MIGHT see something scary.Can't really recommend this over any other 'found footage' flicks. It's moody / atmospheric, if only 'cause portions of it at filmed in the dark. Otherwise? Not a whole lot going for it.I'd rather recommend watching the originalBlair Witch Project, theParanormal Activityseries, or a personal favorite,Grave Encounters, which actually gives you the creepy visual stuff so many others are lacking...",1361318400,2013-02-20

5.0,"I don't like sports.  I like shows centered around sports even less.  I gave this 5 stars because the cast and the writing has me hooked with the pilot.

5.0,"The original Star Trek series took time to establish itself as the premiere franchise it is today. The movies steadily improved the characters and special effects, building on a large canon of established Trek lore.  The best movies gleefully embraced this rich history; the failures ignored or contradicted it. Star Trek is simply too big to reinvent, and J.J. Abrams knows it.  So he did the next best thing by tweaking the established universe of Star Trek just enough to carve out his own little patch for the movie.This is the beginning of Star Trek re-imagined as a futuristic Earth that incorporates the go-go 60s with iPod style.  We see Kirk as a kid on the farm, Spock struggling with his half-Vulcan nature and Bones becoming a crotchety windbag--which, it becomes quickly apparent, he always was. We witness Kirk's solution to the Kobiyashi Maru, Spock's acceptance to Starfleet, and the construction of the Enterprise.  In short, this is a true and proper launch of a Star Trek movie, from the beginning, so that all those non-Trekkies won't feel like they missed out...But if you are a non-Trekkie, you missed out.  There are so many nods to Trek lore that my head nearly exploded. SPOILER RED ALERT.Sulu fences! There's a splash of light over the captain's eyes when he sits on the bridge, just like the original series. Red shirts die! The same sounds beep and bleep in the background, from the sensors to the transporters. There are several Wrath of Khan references, from Spock's famous last words to creepy worms that take control of your brain. There's even old-style Romulans and Klingons.  Fans worried that Abrams was going to remake the series in such a way as to make it unrecognizable can rest easy; this is the Star Trek we know and love, dusted off and buffed to a 21st century shine.The plot involves time travel, a guest cameo, and references to the central conceit of the series: Spock follows the rules, Bones doesn't, and Kirk floats above it all, waffling between the two ideologies and blazing his own path as his ego suits him. The movie has no qualms about portraying Kirk as a womanizing jerk or using him as the butt of some hilarious slapstick. It also isn't afraid to push the envelope with the aliens, going beyond makeup to ensure they're just unnerving enough for you to notice them even if the rest of the crew doesn't. This is more than just a new Star Trek, it's Star Trek done right with a bigger budget.There are some flaws.  The villain is one dimensional. Uhura's headstrong personality has to carry the burden of embodying all females in Trek, which begins to grate. Winona Ryder (age 38) seems to have wandered onto the set to play Spock's (Zachary Quinto, age 32) mother. And an uncharacteristically vengeful tactics from the good guys at the end of the movie borders on ""ludicrous speed.""But you know what? I forgive all that.  This movie made Trek worth watching all over again and reminded us why it's okay to travel through time and space, encounter green alien hotties, and bed them.  Because it's FUN.",1241913600,2009-05-10

5.0,This is one of the most underrated shows on TV. I have converted quite a few people to this show who now all love it. I did the same thing with Breaking Bad before it blew up and became a culture phenomenon. Hopefully this show will gain more followers who discover it.  While this isn't on the level of breaking bad it is still a very good show.,1388361600,2013-12-30
3.0,Not badly acted. Script and tension building work . I love the ever pervading atmosphere of an ancient labaryntine New York  apartment complex. One huge apartment anonymous and lost but strangely still in the consciouness of wierd or irate neighbours is very creepy although a faithful attentive doorman presides.The tenant has been advised to squat the apartment in order to uphold a very cheap rental agreement from grand-mother until it goes to court. Meanwhile tenant is mysteriously intimidated.Now this is supposed to be film probably on the paranormal. But ruined by a soon apparent wacking great hole in the back of a wall with a large space going up and down the side of the building....yes  a miscief-maker hired by a determined landlord could well be entering the apartment  which kills off the spooky side of the film.Secondly if the tenant can get the doorman to hire and let in an exterminator then he sure can let in a builder to cover said wacking great hole. There other hole is in the cognitive frontal lobe of the producer to miss this.,1341360000,2012-07-04
5.0,"Plunge into the dark, gritty, wet world of the northwest with this murder mystery that never lets up. Certainly this is a plot driven story, one about a girl who goes missing and is found dead. Mix in some political intrigue, family drama, and some wicked cop tension. Now you have a great setup. Use great direction and sound design, you take it up another notch. Keep the pacing going without losing your breath and you're almost there. Finally, great acting of finely tuned characters and you have a great show, which this one is. What I like most is the seriousness of the drama. A murder isn't treated as some abstract thing. It's real for everyone involved: family, cops, and so on. The effects are devastating and far reaching, as they should be. You won't find very many &#34;pretty&#34; people in this show like those handsome and beautiful actors who portray cops and perpetrators in other venues. This one gets down and dirty. So real, you'll be soaking wet by the time it's over.",1401235200,2014-05-28

4.0,Although I would call myself a sci-fi buff I truly enjoy a show that challenges our mindset.  Years ago (probably 58 yrs.) a comic strip had a detective-Dick Tracy- with a wrist watch that was also a camera and a communication device.  I have lived long enough to see something similar to it come to life.  Long before the first spaceship went into orbit Flash Gordon another comic hero was circling the distant planets in a spaceship.  Sci-Fi for many is boring for me I enjoy seeing the imagination of men/women become reality.,1396051200,2014-03-29

3.0,"I really want to like this show and certainly the actors are by and large, very good in it. But the dilemma of time travel is really too hard to overcome and this series is so cavalier in its treatment of the issue as to keep me from enjoying it as much as I am predisposed to. After all, SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!! Kiera worries about changing the future but just about every more she makes, like the episode when she stopped a serial killer, could be changing that future drastically. She should have watched &#34;City on the Edge of Forever.&#34; And then there is the matter of tone. Just about all good series learn to vary it from episode to episode, to go from almost slapstick one week to somber and sad the next. The change in tone gives weight to all the episodes and makes the somber ones more somber.  But in this show, by and large, every episode is somber. If someone had a belly laugh anywhere in the two seasons, I missed it.",1376092800,2013-08-10

I was a huge fan of Deadwood and thought he was great in that.  Justified has a lot of action in it and I think the reason is his Deadwood character seems an awful lot like Raylan Givens.

The writers have rounded out the character development of each  personality by this fourth season so that viewers can either love or hate them with vigor. Wishing this exciting program would never end is not realistic, but I do! It does not stay confined to a few locations, but we travel the world over in beautiful and rather horrible scenery and settings the average person would never see or set foot in.

Most lines just came off flat or inappropriate to the character or situation.  Watching Mike Vogel and Rachelle Lefevre is about as exciting as reading the label on the back of a shampoo bottle.

5.0,"The title of the film is deceptive.  Jason Statham plays Joey Jones a returning Special Forces soldier who committed atrocities while stationed in Afghanistan.  Living under a cardboard box on the London streets Joey salves his guilt in booze and drugs.  He develops a relationship with a fellow homeless woman, Isabel, who later disappears.  Joey finds refuge in an abandoned flat that is conveniently vacant while its owner is away for business in America.  Cleaning himself up he is noticed by some Asian mobsters when he bounces some rowdy soccer fans from the restaurant he's working in.  Joey is quickly hired as a debt collector and becomes flush with cash.  It is while plying this trade that word filters to him that Isabel was working as a prostitute and killed by a vicious john which causes Joey to seek revenge.  You ask yourself is this redemption or retribution?  Ah, there is a twist.  While on the streets Joey forges a bond with Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek), a nun who works on the streets feeding the poor.  You wouldn't think there would be a connection between the two but Sister Cristina is doing penance for an incident in her past life in her native Poland.  For this there is a kinetic bond between the brutish Joey and the beatific Cristina that is quite tender and beautiful.  You also ask whose redemption is it, Joey or Cristina's?  For those who would dismiss Statham as a lightweight, some have argued he can't act, should take note of his work here.  When given material he can sink his teeth into as he has here Statham elevates his game.  Statham has never had a female co-star of the caliber of Buzek and she draws out of him emotions you never thought him capable of.  This film is helmed expertly by Steven Knight and grittily lensed by Chris Menges who won Academy Awards for his work on ""The Killing Fields"" and ""The Mission"".  This film may disappoint a lot of Statham's core fans but those who are charting his progress as an actor this film is a revelation.",1380844800,2013-10-04
4.0,"Last year the entertainment world hit a major road block. Movies were put on hold and television shows were asked to cut their seasons short. Many dissapointed fans were very upset and of course what do they do they point their fingers are the wrong people.One of the shows that unfortunatly went down hard in the writters strike was Heroes. After an incredible first season we were left with an extremly short second season with a sub-par plot. Blame the big heads of entertainment, blame writters, heck blame all the people that destoryed our economy, but don't take it out on the people we tune into every monday night to see their adventures. I have to give Tim Kring and company an A for effort as they managed to fit an entire story into a span of 12 episodes, that's as long as an  entire season on HBO people! I loved the new characters that they brought into the show like Maya and Elle. Of course I will watch Kristen Bell even if it was her on a cheesy reality show. I loved how they brought us inside the Company and showed us the origins of how and why it was formed. I think the only downside for me was Peter's story in the whole second season. I do beleive if they had entire 22 episode season there would have been much more to his story. Now as we are about so enter Season 3 dubed 'Villians' I feel that Heroes will be back in it's groove and redeem the show bringing it back to it's awesome glory.",1221523200,2008-09-16

The supporting characters are wonderful in their respective rolls too. However, these productions should be viewed by mature audiences as much of the content may be objectionable due to strong language, sexually explicit shots, and graphic violence.

The lead character is quirky and even believable considering he survived 12 years in prison as a convicted cop.  His search for the &#34;real&#34; killers of the crime he was convicted for is very convoluted and involves his partner's father.  The production quality is very good.  Even though it is a crime show  (murder) , we don't feel depressed after watching.  It doesn't dwell on the gory.  I recommend this show.  Wish there were more episodes.

5.0,"....hard to watch because of the terrible scenarios that are either super embarrassing or super heinous, or a combo of the two, lol. Still one of the funniest shows out there, and certainly one of the few that make a real attempt to take you outside your comfort zone and force you to acknowledge some of the worst aspects of humanity. There really isnt anything else out there that I can think of that is anything like this show. This season in particular was better than season 7 I think. At this point though, the seasons pretty much lack relevance. It's each individual episode that will take you somewhere you may or may not want to be, and is as irreverent as possible while doing so.",1390089600,2014-01-19

5.0,"This is based on a true fact of Chinese history, and John Woo, a master at film-making, has taken full advantage of computer-generated skill to present us with vast armies, flotillas of warships and - of course - one of his favorite stars, Jet Li.The film is awesome and spectacular, and no one has mastered the concept of a moving camera as well. Gone is the stationary tripod, and Woo keeps his camera hovering over and around his characters almost constantly. This is an epic winner.",1395446400,2014-03-22
5.0,"Yes, I'll have to agree with a majority here. I began watching this on Netflix recently by word of mouth & it's a really good show. The cg animation style reminds me of Aeon Flux or some other European style graphic art with it's kinetic colors & elongated body's. It features an intelligent story to compliment the equally enthralling visuals. Highly recommended to scifi or animation fans. Not unlike Fringe, this is surely to become a fan favorite too.

5.0,"This is the 2nd season/series of the rebooted Doctor Who featuring Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor, and he does not disappoint in the slightest.  Very impressive acting and the character has a feeling of being very genuine and very authentic.  The show continues to thrive and is both fun and entertaining to watch, and some of the stories, while outwardly entertaining, also really make you think about things in ways you otherwise might have overlooked - which I feel is true of several seasons/series of Doctor Who - but it certainly continues in this one.  This year again featured the Ponds, Amy and Rory as The Doctor's companions.  Excellent special effects as usual and great writing, but superb acting, especially by Matt Smith.  Matt Smith may have been the only person who could have adequately followed David Tennant's 10th Doctor in the iconic and legendary role.

Every other site slams this movie with honest reviews, IMDB has this as 4 of 10 stars with 673 votes. Put two and two together here folks. You saw the trailer right? If not, go see it, and you will know this movie is going to be horrible just from watching that. Horrible acting, bad editing, dodgy sound, ugly lead actresses, dumb plot, and made by two girls no one I know has ever heard of. What where they popular on a public access show they produced in a town that all 32 residents living their watched it? So why is there reviews here praising how much they love them? Sounds to me like one of the following possibilities.1 - One or both of the twins wrote a review or two here.2 - Some pervert just heard it was female twins and went nuts obsessing over it.3 - Friends of friends of friends... you know, ""like my movie on facebook guys!!!""4 - It's just a bunch of jokers having a stupid laugh.5 - Drunk or mental conditions apply to the reviewer.6 - Watched the wrong movie.Add a 7 if you have any more thoughts :D",1403395200,2014-06-22

4.0,"Eran Creevy has written and directed a fast-paced, desperately confusing film that is tough to decipher and in many ways scorns credibility.  But if action packed dark thrillers fill the bill for you then WELCOME TO THE PUNCH certainly will.  Just be prepared that a lot of the story begs indulgence until the very end.The film opens in medias res with a robbery where one perpetrator Jacob Sternwood (the always reliable Mark Strong is a very sold portrayal) wounds eager detective Max Lewinsky (James McAvoy looking a bit scruffy with a wannabe beard) in the leg. Three years later the story begins. Now `former criminal' Jacob Sternwood is forced to return to London from his Icelandic hideaway when his son Ruan (the very handsome and sensitive and underused Elyes Gabel) is involved in a heist gone wrong. This gives detective Max Lewinsky one last chance to catch the man he has always been after. His partner is a female version of Max - Sarah Hanks (Andrea Riseborough)- and the tow are under the leadership of detectives Thomas Geiger (David Morrissey) and Harvey Crown (Jason Flemyng). Events begin to change with eh entry of a new criminal Dean Warns (Johnny Harris) and his presence begins to open doors as to who is really a good guy and who is a bad guy. As they face off, they start to uncover a deeper conspiracy Jacob and Max both need to solve in order to survive.The cast is uniformly fine, including the bit parts played by such actors as Daniel Kaluuya, Ruth Sheen, Daniel Mays and Dannielle Brent.  The story involves good cop/bad cop, transformation of images, political snafus, and a lot of firepower.  The plot is often too muddled to decipher but the action is fast and the acting is super.

5.0,"Okay, I was very uncertain about continuing this series after finding out that not only did the show lose Mitchell's character, but George and Nina too! However, because I have yet to see any bad acting whatsoever in this series and I've become seriously hooked on its particular weird cross of Supernatural meets Monty Python I decided to stick with Season 4. And I'm very glad that I did. Both the new actors who bring the characters Hal and Tom to the show bring their characters to life and continue to charm me. I don't really think of them as replacements for the ones who've gone, but simply new friends in their own right. And of course Annie is lovely and sweet, but shows us in this episode that she isn't quite the pushover that she used to be. The first few episodes of the season were a bit shaky for me with so many new people coming onto the scene, but this episode is the one where the new set of friends finally, really click. You get the sense that Annie has once again found a home with her new vampire and werewolf friends and the three are united in their efforts to keep a young baby safe from other supernatural forces that want her dead. Sorry, not giving anything away. If you want to know what I'm talking about you have to watch the show.Without giving anything away I'd say if you had been shunning Season 4, because you can't reach for the remote without sobbing then it's time to dry those tears and keep watching. Because the one thing this show isn't ever going to be is dull and boring.",1335830400,2012-05-01

I don't like the Vato angle, though Jimmy Smits is great, and I am not huge fan of his. I dunno... once Opie died and Otto bit off his tongue, i think that was the end for me. The violence doesn't seem to have a point, it just seems to be for the glorious sake of violence.

2.0,"I'm a bit torn in my evaluation of the new thriller ""Rites of Spring."" As a low budget shocker, it leaves a lot to be desired with a clunky screenplay that raises more questions than it answers. But I also appreciated that the film attempted to meld two different film genres into one story. If not always successful, it was something that I'd never really seen before. So I'll give writer/director Padraig Reynolds points for originality. ""Rites of Spring"" is really two different films. One is a standard heist picture and one is a horror story. Neither is particularly well developed or spectacular on their own, but it's the mash-up that keeps things interesting. My head is telling me that the movie should only rate about two stars. My heart, however, is pushing me toward three stars just because the idea behind the film is rather bonkers. And I like that! I didn't love ""Rites of Spring"" and probably wouldn't view it a second time, but I enjoyed seeing the two stories collide!The first plot thread revolves around the unexplained disappearances of young women that have plagued a small community. Two girls out for a night are abducted and soon find themselves in a treacherous situation. The creepy fellow that grabbed them seems to be preparing them for a ritual sacrifice. But for what? And is there any chance of escape? The other story revolves around a gang of losers that decide to kidnap a wealthy man's daughter to extract a fortune in ransom. Of course, not all goes as planned. There are some major trust issues and personal agendas within the group. Before the evening is through, they'll have to determine just who is playing whom. But wouldn't you know it? The abducted girls are on a property adjacent to the where the kidnappers are holed up. So a night of crime will soon collide with a night of horror. As the body count escalates, it becomes a battle for survival. Will anyone endure until dawn?My biggest complaint about ""Rites of Spring"" has to do with a lack of genuine plot development. Nothing really makes much sense in the telling. Neither story, as written and presented, would be satisfying on its own and that's a near fatal misstep. The kidnapping scheme is rather ridiculous and we never know how these guys got together to do something so extreme. Meanwhile, the horror story gets the vaguest (and most over-used) of explanations. Reynolds sets up these two separate scenarios, but each one feels a bit lazy (especially if taken alone). Trust me, aside from the mash-up angle, you've seen it all before and you've seen it better. At a brief 81 minutes, however, it is just nutty enough to hold your attention. About 2 1/2 stars. As I said, I'd have been happy enough watching this for free, but it's not something that I'd recommend as a blind purchase. KGHarris, 11/12.",1353024000,2012-11-16
4.0,"This show has some charm about it. It seems to branch off into two storylines -- two mobile app developers try to sell their dating app to a Silicon Valley legend. One short, chubby programmer tries to get a date with a coworker with the assistance of a older, uninhibited pal. The show had a nice balance of technology and human elements. It's very similar to Big Bang Theory, a show I don't like, but isn't bogged down by the laugh track, odd relationship between 4 successful adult males, and focus on sexual obsessions -- well, at least not entirely, not yet. If it can not become BBT, it could be interesting.",1368057600,2013-05-09

Logic holes so big you can drive semi trucks through, horrid dialogue, pure teen formula show complete with theme music for scenes to give &#34;mood/meaning&#34;.  How something like this saw enough production to make it live is beyond me and shows just how little studios think of teenagers and the public in general.  Either that or our culture really is that bankrupt and intellectually exhausted to where shallow teenage antics are considered worthy story material no matter how stupid the presentation.  I could go on, but you really are wasting precious minutes of your life watching this.",1402185600,2014-06-08
4.0,"Oddly enough, this handsome co-production (BBC and HBO) of ""Parade's End"" isn't even the first adaptation of this wartime saga that I've seen this year! BBC has also dusted another version from 1964 out of their archives for DVD release, and I watched that one prior to settling down to this most current version. Although it has no particular bearing on my comments about this interpretation, it might be of interest to you if you love the story. It features nice performances (Jeanne Moody is merciless as Sylvia) and boasts a young Judi Dench as the second female lead Valentine. I love Dench, so it was a win-win! Ford Madox Ford's ""Parade's End"" is an epic tale of love, scandal, marriage, and war. It is also about propriety, integrity, and retaining gentlemanly values as the world crumbles around you. It has a very moral center which is why the 1964 version didn't even feel particularly dated, and this lovely new adaptation is nicely stylized between the modern and the old-fashioned. The original publications were actually a series of four shorter novels released between 1924-28 that were pulled together and packaged under the new title of ""Parade's End."" And pretty much, with this journey, you're getting the bulk of the tale as related through the first three of these novels (the fourth is largely dismissed critically).There is no denying the extraordinary efforts that the creators have employed to make this prestige piece a can't miss proposition for adult audiences. With beautiful production values, vivid lead performances and an incredibly literate script from premiere playwright Tom Stoppard, ""Parade's End"" presents a powerful, but not overstated, character journey set against the backdrop of World War I. We pick up with the characters prior to the war, and leave them on the other side. In between, though, everything changes about the lifestyles to which they have become accustomed. The star is Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Christopher Tietjens. Tietjens is an upright aristocrat trapped in a rather complicated marriage to Sylvia (Rebecca Hall). After establishing the unpleasantness of this pairing, the story has Tietjens meeting a free spirited suffragette (Adelaide Clemens). The remainder of the story follows these three principles, and assorted other characters, as they navigate a world ravaged by war.Brief Synopsis (No major spoilers, but don't read if you don't want a quick outline of events):Told in five parts, the story begins in 1908. In the introductory chapter, we meet the three central characters. As Tietjens attempts to be the proper gentleman in every circumstance, the cards seem stacked against him. Cuckolded by a vicious wife, intrigued by a new love, and trying to be a supportive friend, he finds himself in the middle of drama and scandal that is completely unwarranted. Playing off themes of class and gender, Tietjens is almost victimized by propriety and the results are very personal and devastating. These complications lead to a stint in military service while the war rages. He gets stationed in France and later in Belgium, the conflict is just one more component in his constant struggle for understanding. Plagued by moral and social constraints, the war only compounds these concerns. It is almost a physical manifestation of an internal battle. While he will see some fighting, the biggest challenges still come from within. But as the war comes to a close, Tietjens must return home and try to reconcile the horrors he's seen. But into whose arms will he find himself? The war and his recent experiences with Sylvia have really taken a toll, and his soul is battered and bruised. As he recounts the trauma, the confession serves as a catharsis. But is it too late to claim a new life?End SynopsisThe supporting cast is filled with great and familiar faces. Not everyone, though, has a lot to do. Miranda Richardson, Claire Higgins, Rupert Everett, Janet McTeer, Roger Allam, Rufus Sewell, and Jack Huston are among some of the more recognizable faces. Rebecca Hall elicits some sympathy as Sylvia (not an easy thing to do) and is quite good. She has been rather inconsistent or unremarkable in some of her past roles (one of 2012's worst performances in Stephen Frears' terrible misfire ""Lay The Favorite""), but she acquits herself well here. Of course, it helps that she gets all the great withering lines! The piece, however, is just one more showcase for the increasingly impressive Cumberbatch. His versatility and talent are becoming a force to be reckoned with! He is fantastic throughout in a challenging role. A slight miscalculation for me was Clemens as Valentine. Supposed to be a strong suffragette, she comes off a bit wan and less interesting than those around her. Overall, this is a dignified period piece that takes its time. It requires patience and rewards it. It may not be for every taste but I, for one, was more than happy to take this emotional sojourn. About 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 3/13.",1379462400,2013-09-18

5.0,"I have read so many seemingly misguided reviews that I almost don't know where to start.  I should start with what my children thought of it.  They were thrilled with the colors, the hidden numbers, the catchy tunes, and loved that there was an older sister and younger brother.  They are the younger twin sisters (4) of a 7 year old boy.  While one was afraid of the ""mean kid,"" the other was not.  We have one who is a bit ahead academically than the other, and this was enjoyed by both.  The math was beyond the one, but the other is just getting in to math so she loved it!My kids don't know racism.  People remark about the watermelon floor.  My kids LOVE watermelon and thought it was hilarious that a floor would be named that.  It's just a cute show.  I don't think anyone needs to read too much in to it.  If you want your kids to think it's racist to have watermelon with 2 african american characters, then explain it to them.  If you are offended the boy's name is Sam because you think it's racist and not just a cute name to match with Sarah, then don't watch it.  And if you don't like the kids shown with electronics because they can't be responsible with them in the first place, then use it as a chance to explain to your kids why the concept is silly.  If you don't like that the ""mean kid"" is white because it ruins your kids self esteem by not giving him a role model, then be the role model YOURSELF!Or simply let it just be a cute, educational cartoon and let your kids be kids.

5.0,"Most Americans fell in love with the mole terrorist thriller ""Homeland"". What most of them do not realize is that this series was originally created for Israeli tv by Gideon Raff and called ""Hatufim"" (Prisoners of War) and then adapted to American tv as ""Homeland"". Raff is obviously a very talented guy and he now is debuting a third show, ""Tyrant"", on FX channel.This time he has set the show in the Middle East, not America, but the central character is an American doctor who is the son of the tyrant who runs the country. This forces everyone into speaking English which will please those who hate reading subtitles.I can tell this is Raff's work as there is a lot of similarity among his series. In this one, a tyrant in an Arabian country gets his son to return because his nephew is getting married. However, the son does not want to be there as his father, as an oppressor, is against everything in which he believes. He ran away when he was 16 years old and is now an American doctor, a pediatrician.The only ""off"" part is his extremely annoying American family, his wife and two teenagers, who are with him. They are complete stereotypes of Americans as is the American ambassador.  I frankly wonder if Raff's planning to kill some or all of them off since he has made them so annoying.Raff's strength in this series is in portraying the people of the Middle East, not Americans. The doctor's brother is the heir to taking over the country. He embodies all of the worst characteristics of everyone in the family. He is as bad a tyrant as his father but he has no strength of character and doesn't think things through. The father does not have these faults. The brother acts before he thinks and it is always the wrong move. The father realizes the wrong son is slated to take over but short of killing the heir, there is no way to derail his ascendancy. Meanwhile, there are many other people in this country who do not want the son as leader and they are growing in number and revolutionary acts.I admire all of Gideon Raff's work. I have seen all of these series. ""Tyrant"" is playing now on FX and I am up to date on the episodes. I recommend you watch all of these series.",1405036800,2014-07-11

The one thing I have to say that I feel anyone can tell is that these supposed chefs aren't chefs at all,  we have one contestant supposedly who had almost eight years of culinary skills and they still couldn't cook a steak right?  If you want to actually see real chefs check out the cooking channels Iron Chef this show is just about a bunch of wannabes trying to pretend to be good cooks just for their fifteen minutes of fame and a chance for a comfy position,  I mean you can't help but laugh as Ramsays tears into the contestants as they spoil the entrees and dishes in rather spectacular style most of the times and you can't help but laugh as some of the impostor chefs mess up their cooking from mashed potatoes to salads.  At the end it really isn't so much about the contestants but just watching as Ramsays goes about criticizing the ineptitude of these fake chefs,  and while it's enjoyable it also becomes annoying too somewhat as you watch the background backstabbing of these people when they're forced to choose someone for elimination from the show.  So if you're looking for a soap opera cooking show with lots of shouting, bad cooking, and basically lousy chefs here's the one for you but for a true cooking show challenge Iron Chef is really the only way to go...",1293235200,2010-12-25

4.0,"They are a quintessential spot within the series.  They are running out of steam for show ideas, and are reaching in a few directions.  If they can find a good focus and get the writing solid they can go a few more seasons.  The series is still enjoyable, but I worry about where it is going.  The characters of course are excellent and bring you into the show.  If this series fails it will be for the writers and not the actors and actresses.  Enjoy.",1401494400,2014-05-31
5.0,"Helen Mirren is in my mind the best actress of our time.. I cannot think of a film where she did not shine!  She is able to take on the personna of the character she is playing, she is believable, honest, intelligent, and quite lovely.I recently reviewed the first couple of episodes, and in the first series, the difficult time that DCI Jane Tennison had breakng into the old boy's network, comes full force. The smirks, the lies, the deceit from the men who were so afraid of a woman taking over. When she had her first win, and the men in her department greeted her with cheers and champagne, I ffelt tears in my eyes. I was a woman in the 60's and felt the discrimination and had the bottom pitching. I knew exactly what she went through.  Tom Ball who plays DC Otley, the most despicable liar of the entire team has his comeuppance and none too soon. The other big distinction between the time Helen Mirren plays Tennison and now, is the amount of smoking that took place. A clig in everyone's fingers was not out of place.  We see a little bit of the personal life of Tennison and we cheer her on. She has a difficult time. Always well groomed and well dressed, Tennison is the kind of woman we all want in our lives as a mentor and friend.From an early review of 'Prime Suspect', I found this from the New York Times, ""THINKING back to the impression Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison made when the British crime drama ""Prime Suspect"" first reached America in 1992, it's easy to focus on strength: the hard set of her jaw as she took on the sexism and cronyism of a London police force that, in real life, had only four female detectives out of a total of about 500 at the time."". Sets the mood for the series.'Prime Suspect remains one of my favorite series, certainly because of Helen Mirren, but also the strong, wonderful character she plays, DCI Jane Tennison.Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-01-12State of PlayThe Debt.",1346457600,2012-09-01

2.0,"If one earthquake could destroy an entire South American city, and unleash the worst of humanity to wreak havoc on innocent people, then don't go. I'm not sure what the message of this movie is, except that South American cities may have lax building codes, and many old buildings, that are ready to collapse. I guess that's true, but the rest of the story seems to be some kind of portrayal  of the consequences of sin, and the risk of chance.

3.0,"Interesting. An attempt to diagnose psychosis and its origins through mayhem and impulsive violence. Intense, twisted, disturbed. But, like so much of life, only one side of the story. I'd hate to live in a universe based on these types of movies. Everything would be very serious, very grave and your life would be in danger every minute, from sources both natural and unnatural. Life on the edge. What put it there?",1397260800,2014-04-12

1.0,"Disgusting, revolting, socially unacceptable, morally reprehensible.America at a new low.This is the worst kind of presentation. It is demeaning, insulting, insensitive, moronic, vile and absolutely valueless. In the first five minutes we get apparently really drunk people on-camera trying to be entertaining - not - and then just to show the true veracity of the premise, one of the actors throws up on screen and they SHOW it.I hope everyone involved in this disgusting piece of tripe has a life full of karmic consequences for this bizarre and terrible, terrible idea.Amazon - remove this foul piece of pap before it turns away more customers - what were they thinking when they did this - oh yeah, they were drunk...yeah that's what I want to deal with, drunken mediocrity, vomit, misinformation, and the insane idea that anything in this is &#34;funny&#34; - it is not, it is an insult to decency..",1405468800,2014-07-16

Savino's also charged with expanding the empire of the mob.Randy Quaid plays Ralph Lamb (based on a real character) who was appointed sheriff because of his Army MP stint.

5.0,"I love these people. I've never met them. Not in person. But I love it when I get to be with them for 20 minutes or so every time I watch an episode of New Girl. These wonderfully quirky individuals are hilarious, warm, and messed up. I thought I was weird, but when I watch them I feel a bit more normal. Which, now that I think about it, is not necessarily a good thing. I'd really prefer to be where they are.",1382140800,2013-10-19
5.0,"Loving season 2! The first few episodes of season 1 had me watching with lights on. Season 2 hasn't been as frightening in the ""ghost story"" sense, but it has been terrifying on many other levels. The asylum setting (and the people who may or may NOT belong there) gives me alot of anxiety. The storylines are interesting. The writing is sick, twisted, and brilliant. And the acting is superb--Jessica Lange rocks it once again as a deranged and vindictive nun and Sarah Paulson is a sight to behold. This is not a continuation of the first season (come on people, do you NOT have internet access?!). Some of the actors are the same, but their characters--and the storyline--are completely different. If you are not enjoying season 2--you're doing it WRONG!",1352332800,2012-11-08

4.0,"Exciting but short of riveting. Possibly because plot is very complicated. Treachery at so many levels requires near superhuman organization which conspiracy wonks are so quick to embrace. If you buy into the possibilities this is a very entertaining series. Acting is superb. If we think the ending leaves us with many questions about the future-- I embrace a quote from a famous philosopher. &#34;Oh, how our problems are soooo complicated. But the answer is so simple&#34; -- dr Seuss.",1361404800,2013-02-21
4.0,This show's going to take a while to develop but it's headed in the right direction.  It's starting to find its legs and is different from all other network comedies with sharp dialogue and adult situations.  Greg Kinnear holds the show together and he has a great supporting cast including the talented John Ortiz.,1393891200,2014-03-04
1.0,"Willow Creek is by far and wide, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The universal acclaim it gets from top-notch critics is alarming, if not terrifying. In fact, Willow Creek's high ratings is the only ""scary"" thing about this movie you will find.When a new found-footage flick gets dumped in theaters, the first word that comes to mind is gimmick. This type of film making attempts to create suspense the cheap way, in light of budget constraints. Very few films are better off having been filmed like this. Chronicle is the only recent one that comes to mind.There have been many, and I mean *MANY* advancements in this film style since The Blair Witch Project. Unfortunately, Willow Creek is so shoestring, that it is more or less a step back into 1999. The budget (if there is one), is not conducive to a monster movie. Let alone Bigfoot, the least terrifying monster anyone can make a movie about.The obvious payoff would be an actor running around in a fur suit, making horny gorilla sounds. If done correctly, the blurry footage would reenact the infamous Patterson-Gimlin sighting. Willow Creek does not end this way.***SPOILER ALERT***Instead of a cheap monkey costume, or even a furry ape hand, the Bigfoot of Willow Creek turns out to be more than one. What the movie does show us is a female variation that is basically a fat 40-something with slinky tits hanging down to her waist, wearing nothing but adult diapers and what looks to be some sort of necklace (an alligator foot?), that was purchased at the nearest truck stop. That's it, no joke. The rest of the final scene involves loud growling and screeching coming from an unseen Bigfoot party as the star couple is mauled and dragged to their death. This entire sequence involves the cameraman's video recorder zoomed in on tall grass as it's dragged along with its owner.Does Willow Creek break any new ground, add something new to the genre, or deliver anything in terms of entertainment value? FNO! Garbage like this should not be green lighted. There are porno's with more exciting dialogue than this. GRADE = F.",1402012800,2014-06-06
4.0,"I got turned on to this show by my co-workers and it is a great show. However, I find myself disliking most of the main characters. They are supposedly good guys, but will sink to the lowest levels to save themselves. The show is well written and very suspenseful, but most of the characters' behavior and actions just turns me off. In this series, no one really wears the white hat.",1372723200,2013-07-02
4.0,"So far, I like this series, and the study of that period's mode of conduct and manners.  I liked that these rigid norms could be overcome at times by prayer and care for fellow creatures.  Old familiar faces of actors doing period pieces.  Judi Dench is truly versatile.",1393632000,2014-03-01
5.0,One of the best series I have seen so far. The lead character is so twitchy and so out there you sometimes feel the same pain he's going through and are thankful that he has someone to help him through the adjustments he has to make while solving crimes and trying to live his life outside of the office.,1385510400,2013-11-27

So far I have watched all but the first episode (which I will get back) and the second one (Hooters - no need for me to bother) and what can I say?? For reasons I don't have time to share now (but will later) I THINK THIS SHOW IS WONDERFUL!!!! :)If I had children (especially growing teens) THIS is the show we would be watching on Friday nights!!! (Of course, it would be followed by a fun movie or an evening of games.)What better way to encourage discussion then to see the unscripted (whoever did the research -- thank you very much; I was wondering about that) lives of some Americans who are STILL working hard -- day to day -- expecting NOTHING from ANYONE! Granted, I often wonder how many people they don't show, but the ones they choose to show?They inspire me to continue to believe that American isn't becoming like the third world country I just got finished spending 4 years in. They remind me that there REMAIN some who have will and determination to give their best in order to accomplish what they ARE being PAID to do.What more can I say? So far, so good!Thank you (producers) for giving me hope in the midst of a world full of deteriorating ""entertainment!""",1368057600,2013-05-09
2.0,"'The Canyons' is one of those films you hear about, that is so bad that you have to see for yourself. Plus, it was supposed to be the comeback of Lindsay Lohan. What I kept thinking when I saw Lindsay Lohan was the amount of bruises on her legs that were apparently not covered by make-up. It was sloppy, and that is exactly what the film is, sloppy.What we see is the underbelly of Hollywood. The scummy, seamy side. A young, would be starlet, Lindsay Lohan, being kept by a millionaire porn star. Sex with differing couples, or with men whom the porn star has promised a night with Lohan. The plot is thick with wanna be's and with actors working as waiters and bar tenders, selling and playing with sex and drugs on the side. Everyone seems to be a little 'off' is it the drugs or are they all mentally ill? No matter, thus is not a good film. I am not sure if it ever made it to the big screen. Lots of hoopla, where nothing delivers.Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 11-05-13",1383609600,2013-11-05
4.0,"Deb/Jane is doing her thing again this season. Season 3 ended with Stacy telling Grayson that Jane was really Deb. I've been watching the free episodes, but when Stacy dropped that bombshell, I had to buy season 4.This season had its usual share of Ally McBealish cases. I like the weird verdicts and all of the singing - what can I say? I'm a sucker for musicals. What isn't so easy for me to digest is Brandi's role as Parker's baby mama.  Brandi will always be Brandi to me. I can't imagine her in an acting role.  Also I don't get how easy it is for Jane and Grayson to sleep around with other people when they know they really want each other. It's like two dogs in heat circling around each other.Well, finally on the very last episode of season 4, Jane is about to marry Owen (who by the way, I don't think is a good match for her), when Grayson tells her he's in love with her! They kiss, and then at that exact moment, Owen walks in, see them, clutches his heart, and....wait! I can't tell you what happened. You gotta watch it for yourself!And let's hope that there is a season 5. As of this moment, Lifetime has not decided to pick the show up for a 5th season.

4.0,"Based on its price and existing reviews, I decided to try ""White Collar,"" Season 1 and believe me, it was worth all 1,900+ pennies.  The story revolves around a classy master thief (played by Matt Bomer) who strikes a deal with the FBI agent (played by Tim McKay) who caught him twice, all in order to avoid going back to jail.  The agent works in the FBI's white-collar crime division in New York City and the master thief is there to provide a criminal's perspective to each case.  Catch is that the thief is confined to a two-mile radius by an ankle bracelet and needs to locate his missing girlfriend.  Tiffany Thiessen (of ""90210"" fame) stars as the agent's wife.  Great cast works well together.  Solid, believable scripts kept me interested and jonesing for season 2.  Could be filmed in L.A. for all I know, but looks like NYC to me.",1327968000,2012-01-31

2.0,"All the parts were there for a truly fine series.  Good actors awesome budget...  well ok maybe not all the parts.  The story lines while interesting were executed poorly and the special effects just didn't do justice to the show.  What really stuck out to me as unacceptable were the fight scenes.  Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new ""strength"".  In the fight scenes she couldn't fight here way out of a wet paper bag.  One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise, no broken bones nothing.  When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing.  She can take a punch better than ALI ever could.They say the writers strike condemned this show to one season.  I really doubt that.  I would not purchase a second season.",1381363200,2013-10-10
5.0,"Very good movie.  Very moving.  I think everyone should see it.  It is a shame that this real life drama took place but it does teach on what is still going on in this world.

5.0,"The writing, the directing, and most of all, the acting in this show is amazing. I wish I could talk as eloquently as Boyd. What's fun is that everyone seems to understand him even though it's set in the hills of Kentucky where one would expect there to be little or no education. I think Boyd is my favorite character followed by Raylan. Now, there's an actor. With his squinty eyes and facial expressions, he often doesn't have to say a word for you to know what's going on in his head. And, just about everything that does come out of his mouth is riddled with humor or sarcasm. If you get him to smile, he just lights up the room. I love this show and wish it wasn't coming to an end.

4.0,"IT's rare for a filmic version of a comics persona/series - much less a classic of the &#34;pulp&#34; novels of the early 20th Century -  to keep the feel of the original intact. While it has some flaws, Solomon Kane manages to absorb the viewer as the novel does and yet bring some of the &#34;telegraphic&#34; feel of the comic as well. If you want a nice escape from reality on a rainy afternoon, this is a good choice. It ain't great art, but that's not what one should expect of fantasy-adventure. Purefoy is believable, the bad guys are really bad, the good guy is conflicted and therefore interesting, and the production is lush with nice special effects and a whole lot of wicked costuming.",1361404800,2013-02-21

And why does escape seem to involve tramping over snow-covered mountain ridges, sensuThe Lord of the Rings?

2.0,"I was skeptical going into this movie. Nothing really good can come out of Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere when they want to ""denounce"" corporate greed. Everything was clich&eacute; in this movie. Down to the donation of 2 millions to a cancer research foundation, that will be used to make the doctors more rich and famous for nothing. They will use the funds to have ""meetings"" in exotic places in order to ""share the information"" (I haven't seen a scientific meeting downtown Detroit in a while). They will use the money to have big dinners and share big awards between them and patting themselves on the back. No drug that will cure a real disease will ever come out from these big donations and galas. In spite of this, people still believe that they are doing the right thing by donating money to these foundations. What a waste!The plot is somehow complicated and we are not getting a real answer because the movie just ends!  Robert Miller (Gere) is a hedge-fund magnate (immediately you think he is the bad evil guy who deserves to die!) who has manipulated the books because of a bad investment (where else, in Russia) that cost him 420 millions. He wants to unload his company for approximately the same amount of money to replace the money before somebody checks the books (I guess he thinks that somebody who spends this kind of money, will not check the books first for accuracy,...but that is another story). One night while driving with his mistress he falls asleep and gets into an accident. She dies and he tries to cover up.Taking lessons of ethics and behavior in life from Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon it is quite amazing. I knew immediately even before the movie started that their goal was to denounce corporate greed and arrogant behavior. They didn't succeed in their goal since his mistress is not portrayed as a great person and we don't know much about her, just that she is of French origin. His wife is a cold selfish person that nobody should care about, and he is not greedy, he is just trying to cover for a mistake. They didn't want to make a real thriller or a mystery movie. They could have taken that route. That would have been a much better film. But they decided to make a (bad) propaganda movie. Just another complaint about people with money.  But wait: aren't they also arrogant millionaires that give their money to hedge-fund managers to make more money? And when I watched the extras I saw a patronizing Sarandon and a serious Gere lecturing us about the problems of the world and what is ethical or not.  What a bunch of pretentious hypocrites!Richard Gere performance is the same as in ""Pretty Woman"" or ""an Officer and a Gentleman"". Average, nothing special. When I heard rumors of him going for the Oscars this year against Daniel-Day Lewis in ""Lincoln"" it made me vomit. This film was already nominated for the Golden Globe which is a prelude to the Oscars. The only reason they will give him an award for this pathetic performance in this pathetic movie, is because everything is rigged in Hollywood and they want to promote their anti-Wall Street propaganda. Really don't understand why the Hollywood people will bite the hand that feeds them. I don't think that the average Joe buys their propaganda: ""white collar corruption"", ""corporate greed"", ""fair share...fair share""...blah, blah, blah. These are clich&eacute; sentences that only minimum educated people (...like the occupy Wall Street moronic crowd) believe. This is totally illogical. Nothing in this film deserves even the mention of an award. And please people, get Susan Sarandon some decent clothes. She was dressed with rags like a homeless person throughout the movie. In contrast, Brit Marling was very classy (we can tell that she already worked on Wall Street) but Susan Sarandon...was really very casual (to say the least) for a hedge-fund magnate wife.The only bright moments in this movie are the performances of Jimmy (Nate Parker) and of Detective Bryar (Tim Roth). Great acting and really great presence. But still, trying to manipulate a picture and make up a poorly pixilated license plate was really cheap and sad. Anybody can do much better these days with a computer!Two stars only for Nate Parker's performance that really saves the film from the abyss where it really belongs together with the entire pathetic script.",1356134400,2012-12-22
2.0,"If you loved The Vicious Brothers and their film ""Grave Encounters,"" they're hoping you'll flock to buy the next chapter of their horror saga creatively titled ""Grave Encounters 2.""  Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Grave Encounters"" was a reasonably effective (if not spectacularly original) entry into the horror arena.  It does seem that every low budget scary movie of late thinks that this is the go-to genre of filmmaking, so it's becoming more difficult to distinguish inventive works from the overcrowded pack.  This sequel employs the same device to carry out the story.  And it is just so tired already!  But as long as the movie has something fresh to offer, found footage can still make for a thrilling visceral experience.  I may not have hated ""Grave Encounters 2"" as much as some--but after a reasonably promising set-up, the film seemed to implode on itself with a lunatic (and ill conceived) final act.The movie takes place roughly two years after the events of the first movie.  A film student (Richard Harmon) is obsessed with the footage of the first film and decides to see if the events depicted were real or not.  As any remarkably sane person would do, he assembles some friends to break into the psychiatric hospital represented two years prior.  Even if everything is real (which he believes), his knowledge of the place and its monsters should provide plenty of clues for survival.  There isn't much more to tell without revealing spoilers.  I'll just say that the introduction (which takes a VERY LONG time) is handled well enough, but a major twist in the hospital kind of derails the franchise.  Very little makes sense after this revelation and the film just gets loopier by the second, and not in a particularly good way.I liked that there is a distinct connection to the first film. Here, The Vicious Brothers made a smart decision.  This movie presupposes that you've seen the original.  Although you can certainly watch this as a stand alone, the finale will lose some of its impact.  But maybe that's a good thing as I really thought that this was the weakest point in the series so far.  If you remember the stylistic differences between ""Blair Witch"" and its abysmal sequel, some of the same mistakes were made here.  It's almost too meta, too referential to the original and so it loses a unique voice of its own.  And with the choices made in the conclusion, it defies the logic of the first picture and this is always something that irritates me.  KGHarris, 3/13.",1362096000,2013-03-01

3.0,"Season 3 of this once great show continues the decline.  And instead of one story arc, it contains two distinct stories.In ""Villains,"" there is a mass escape of villains from Level 5, a detention facility used by The Company to house evil people with superpowers.  Noah Bennett (Jack Coleman) gets to work trying to track them down.  He's surprised to see his new partner is Sylar (Zachary Quinto) who is trying to give up his murderous ways and get back on the straight and narrow.  Can they catch these bad men?  Will Sylar remain a hero?The second half of the season found our characters on the run.  ""Fugitives"" found now Senator Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar) heading a task force aimed at bringing all those with special powers in ""for their own protection.""  Of course, he's failed to mention his own unique powers.  Leading the charge against him is his own brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia).  Will Nathan see the error of his ways before everyone is captured or killed?The problem with this season lay in the story telling.  When the show was actually good (back in season 1), the episodes spent time with the characters, letting us get to know them so we cared about what they were doing or why.  That really drew me in.  Here, we are forced plot points with cardboard characters.  Heck, I had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what to whom it changed so often.  And I just don't care about the characters the way I used to because there is no depth to them.Then there's the case of Sylar.  Don't get me wrong, I think Zachary Quinto is a great actor.  But the way they keep including that character in events is forced and makes me wonder if we'll ever actually go somewhere with the story.Yes, I am still intrigued to see where they are going next to keep watching, but just barely.  They seriously need to make some tough decisions about how to best move the story forward and then stick to it, or they will continue to lose their audience.",1251763200,2009-09-01

It was interesting and did not overload the viewer with too much at one time.

3.0,"First off, let me say, I am not a fan of hand held first person POV movies. It started off with the Blair Witch Project, and I have hated films like it ever since. But something about the trailer to this one looked interesting, and I'm glad I didn't turn my nose up at this one now. V/H/S starts off with the POV cam type of thing where a few guys are smashing things up, and preying on women by ganging up on her and forcing her to allow them to expose her body on cam. I think it was something about them getting paid to do that for money to sell it to internet site perverts and sickos, or something about that. I have a feeling this might be why so many reviews here are for 1 star, because at this point of the movie I was ready to turn it off too and dismiss this as being a POS if this was what the movie was going to be about.Luckily I held in there and got past that crap, and the story gets better as these guys are asked to break into a house somewhere and steal a VHS tape. These idiots record themselves doing this, but that's when this thing starts to get better. As a couple of the guys explore this house looking for a specific tape, another one is left to view what tapes have been left around to try and figure out which tape it is this person who has asked for it wants.One by one they start watching a tape left in this house, and it then shows the footage of what is on the tapes. Each tape is something different, that is horrific, weird and paranormal. It's kind of like little short horror movies, each being different, but each being shot from a hand held camera, or vacation type of video.It ranges from a couple of voyeurs who try to expose the wrong girl, to a couple on vacation who probably should have given a kid a ride, next is a Blair Witch knock off of a killer who can't be filmed for some reason, to a haunted house where something strange is happening upstairs. I think there was more?Overall, by the end of the film, I thought it was a pretty decent movie. It didn't try to claim the footage was supposedly real, so I went in without that seed of wanting to roll my eyes at everything and say &#34;who are these filmmakers trying to kid?&#34; but surprisingly I'm saying the opposite to what I often think of a lot of movies, and that is the first half of this movie is not so great, but the second half picks up and really goes full steam ahead with some decent short stories.the end scene is a bit of a let down, as it pretty much had the same ending as Blair Witch, which by the way, did I mention I fricken hate that #1 over-hyped P.O.S? Or does #1 go to Paranormal Activity? Hmmm... hard choice. So by saying that, if you too hated those movies, and these Cloverfield kind of shot films, then take my word and just give this one a go. Maybe skip the first 10 minutes or so, it's useless footage if you ask me, but once the ball starts rolling, you might be like me and actually find that there is a lot more here then just an attempt at a cheaply made movie. I don't think this one was as cheap as some people might think?Actually, I think I know what it is that makes me like this more than the other ones I mentioned now... it's probably because it actually shows things, whether it be by SFX, CGI or camera tricks, at least they show you kills, ghosts, and decent FX shots. Unlike Blair Witch or P.A movies where you expect to see something, and there is nothing there to see but someone being thrown across the screen on wires and you are expected to be scared simply by noise effects and screaming. This one shows the lot, and is an enjoyable ride to the end.Give a rent or DL at least before dismissing it as just another cheap attempt at low budget horror.",1362787200,2013-03-09

The trouble is, the fact that it has such a questionable feel doesn't bode well.It has good graphics. Yay. But that will only last a little while. That's short term thinking. Here is where they could have made a four star product had there been better story or voice acting to back it up. Can Stark get any higher-pitched?The Cartoon has very limited plot. We're treated to merchandising sales pitches in cartoon form. ""Here's some gear we'll soon have on the shelves, and you kids are going to buy it because the Avengers are on it."" The jet house, the team and the anti-avengers. All set ups for marketing. It's like the suits in accounting wrote the script.One great argument for a one star rating is that the characters are not very likable in this version. There is no room for each character's story, and thus as the team comes together they feel two dimensional and presumptuous. It is far less likely for the audience to forgive negative personality traits if we understand how the characters came to their conclusions.It's frustrating how, despite all their powers the Avengers keep getting whooped by the Red Skull and his tool flunky Modok. And yet, despite almost wiping the heroes out one second, Tony waves a magic wand and utterly and completely defeats the enemy, but somehow misses capturing them in the ensuing kerfuffle of petty Avenger-whining.Iron Man: Tony keeps saying that it was a unanimous decision to ax the Avengers, but then Hawkeye accuses Tony of breaking them up a second time. Everyone either attributes no leadership skills or way over the top ability and nothing in between. Unfortunately, Tony pulls a boner trying to save Cap where he doesn't really do much, kind of lackluster, throwing blasts around vaguely until, BLAM, suddenly he's got everything all figured out and, hey, perhaps he really DID know Cap was really alive and not disintegrated, but, no, he didn't know, and it wasn't us mistaking unrequited genius for a lack of talent. Stark comes off like a wiener who uses people when he needs them, and then cuts them loose and sends them packing the second they're not needed.Captain America in this version is the most wishy-washy, no spine-having-est, oops-I-let-myself-get-shot-and-died-est, would-have-been-spanked-by-the-red-skull-and-left-for-dead-had-not-iron-man-blundered-into-the-frozen-tundra-and-saved-me-est, non-Avenger-est Avenger of all time... except for Falcon, of course.Hawkeye: Not as cool, tongue in cheek as I would imagine. Aside from his purple sun glasses he could be a generic Green Arrow clone.Thor: Let's solve a bunch of problems, but how? Faulty toaster, can't get bread out? Mjolnir! Leaky faucets? Mjolnir!! Can't get a date on a Saturday night? Mjolnir!!! Is there nothing this hammer can't smash? How about a nail, like into wood to fix something. Nope. Asgardians SMASH... Oh, wait. Isn't that the line of...The Hulk: Slightly more intelligent than previous incarnations, but TRYING too much to be like the movie without actually BEING the movie Hulk. Banner MADE the Hulk in the Avenger's movie. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is the best out of the three Hulk-featuring movies, but this show does not even mention that the Hulk HAS an alter ego. He's JUST Hulk. This cartoon has Hulk constantly pulling the unexpected punch or finger flick that made audiences of The Avengers chuckle when Thor went flying in that museum. But this Hulk is also described by his fellow heroes as stinky and foul breathed with no personality other than an intense desire to smash things.Black Widow: Eye candy. She's there to strut in a skin-tight leather suit and bend into a pretzel for mid-puberty teens. Otherwise, there's nothing this version did that a really fit chauffeur could not have, even the nay-saying.Falcon: I know little about this character, but, and I hate to say it, but it feels a bit like a ""token"" to me. He's not the War Machine we've come to know. More like an intern who eked out a salary by being in the right place at the right time. He is NO replacement for Black Panther, who is NO ONE'S token. Black Panther earned his place in the Avengers, and he deserves to be there.In fact, all of these characters get dissed by Iron Man over and over and still hang on his coat-tails like he's passing out free puppies and snow cones. Even Widow, who is just self-aware enough to hate Tony and herself for dripping maudlin on his nice, shiny robo-boots, is compelled to hang on his every command.Um... Is that it? Geeze! Where's Wasp? Ms. Marvel? Antman, or Yellowjacket, or whatever. Come on!One last thought on storyline. The effects here play the vital role in holding this series, but it's not a good casting choice. Bring in a story arc that goes from one end to the other and isn't just a bunch of this guy vs. that guy. Put some thought and heart and effort into the writing and stop worrying about how much to mark up the cheap piece of plastic out of which you'll be making the new Avenger Jet.Justin Bently has a point about not comparing this series to the previous one. Really, this is a whole different animal. There isn't a tie in with the last one like, ""Ok, THAT happened, but now THIS is happening."" It's a reboot, which means that they got to a point where they felt the last series got way off track (presumably) and now they want to completely remake it in keeping with what they've got going on in their current arena. I just can't see how, if it is indeed an attempt to bridge the gap between movies (primarily because they know with all the individual sequels in the works it is going to be a long, long time before the next Avengers installment hits the box office and they need to keep up interest) it is, in my opinion, a feeble attempt. I have seen the Avengers movie a dozen times (more for my kids, really, but I like the movie, too), and this just doesn't have the same personality. For one thing, no one ever seems to change their clothes except Stark. Not even to go to sleep at night. Those costumes must REEK!",1375920000,2013-08-08

4.0,"I didn't check out any of the &#34;pilots&#34; Amazon Prime was testing over the summer and only decided to watch ALPHA HOUSE when I had a half hour to kill one afternoon.  What I saw surprised me.  While not laugh-out-loud funny, I found the pilot chuckle-worthy for the most part, very well-acted and written, in other words, it was like passing time in pleasant company.  So I've kept company with this for another 7 episodes.  It's not as funny, for instance, as HBO's VEEP, another current series about political hijinks and low buffoonery, can be. but it also doesn't suffer the same dry patches that show does.  Good that Garry Trudeau has found a way to keep me amused on a regular basis again, and kudos to Amazon for delivering a low-key but highly watchable new show.",1388275200,2013-12-29

4.0,"I found the pilot amusing yet predictable. The characters were stereotypical, but the plot shifting kept my interest.If I watch this as a regular series I think I may get bored with the repetitive storylines, assuming the writers don't expand the characters and go into new storylines.",1392076800,2014-02-11
4.0,"Season 10 of ""Hell's Kitchen"" was well-produced and kept up suspense week after week. The main memory I have of it, now that it's over, is that this was the most mean-spirited group of competing chefs ever. Of course, they're all competing for a life-changing prize, but in all previous seasons there was at least some sense of fun and camaraderie, a ""we're all in this together"" attitude. Not this time! The situation got to the point that a few times they simply could not work together, so the kitchen had to be closed with diners going away hungry.Also, I wonder about their qualifications. When you see a supposedly trained chef week after week failing to cook sauteed scallops correctly, it gives one pause! It's not hard. I've done it. What gives?Each episode reeked of meanness and animosity. I hope that Season 11, if there is one, has competitors with at least a bit of humanity and humor about them.",1349568000,2012-10-07
4.0,"This is another of what are often called ""small films"" - often by independent production companies but, as in this case, produced under the auspices (and funding) of a national film board (of which there is none in the US). ""Stella Days"" (the title refers to the name of the movie ""venue""  - THE STELLA - I won't call it a ""theater"" - that Martin Sheen , as a priest, wants to open in a small Irish village in 1956.) was produced by the Irish National Film Board (with some participation from Norway, if I remember in the opening credits.) Much of the cast is Irish though the American stars are Martin Sheen and Stephen Rea.). Sheen's accent is not as strong as the others and some of this is excused by giving his character a plot device where he lived in the US for 18 years, thus softening it.I'll defer to the other reviewers here to give you more of the plot - though I watched this DVD with no advance preparation or knowledge - except to think, from the packaging, that it would be similar to 1988's ""Cinema Paradso"" (it isn't).  I enjoyed the film - as I like ""small films"" but thought it could have used some tighter editing (it still only runs 90 minutes). The ""side story"" of electricity just coming to homes in Ireland as late as 1956 was interesting but only tangential to the plot. What really surprised me was how the filmmakers approached the ""money-tizing"" of the Catholic Church. ""Bigger churches are better"", ""We need to raise building funds for a new church even though the old one is perfectly fine"" and how the church gets involved in politics. I'm not a Catholic and wonder how a religious Catholic would view this angle which is prominent in the film.I'm glad I saw it but wouldn't put high on my ""must see"" list.The DVdhas only one bonus: A three-minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette, which spends nearly the first minute with scenes from the film itself.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",1356998400,2013-01-01

5.0,"Another season of mystery and western beauty! Walt Longmire is my hero and I am totally hooked into the Longmire books and TV series. The third season starts where season 2 ended, thanks. We were left hanging with Henry in jail and Branch was shot and hanging by a thread! Walt had his hands full with crime and mystery in his own family - Martha his wife's untimely death and &#34;whodunit?&#34; The episodes are produced & directed admirably! The acting is spot-on with Robert Taylor owning the role of Walter. Lou Diamond Phillips was a good choice for Henry Standing Bear.  The supporting actors in this series have been stellar in their roles. Bailey Chase as Branch Connally gets more development this season - finally. Graham Greene reappears as Malachi and currently heads up the underlying thread of evil crime. Graham is one of my faves! Henry is betrayed by Deena ManyCamps - no surprise! There are terrific character sub stories in these series. Then there is the location cinematography . . . totally gorgeous! Sweeping vistas, mountains, fast running rivers, snow and ELK +! The Longmire series on TV or in books is a winner! Craig Johnson's writing and style from the books does make it into the series!",1405123200,2014-07-12

The series does a great job of developing the characters throughout the first 11 episodes.  I was glad to see that Nash (the Indian American programmer genius) didn't fall into the usual stereotypes and that Mikki is a complicated mess of emotions created by a runaway mother (played by Sandra Oh in one superb episode).  Ed Begley Jr is hilarious as George Murchison, the CEO of the combinator that funds BRB.  Some very topical references here to the current tech scene: Valleywag, various apps, and Snapchat's house on Venice beach.  I really hope Betas gets renewed for a second season.",1390176000,2014-01-20
3.0,"A Black man who hangs in front of a liquor store gets killed.  A Latino in a car gets killed by a white guy.The Black guy's case reminds me a bit of the tragic Jeffrey Dahmer murders.  Dahmer killed a Laotian boy whose brother he molested years earlier.  Here, the Black man is killed by the same man who put him in a wheelchair.  On tape, they show the Black man refusing treatment when a bullet grazed his body.  If he had sought treatment, maybe he would have no longer been in the murderer's sight and would have lived.  This may be a lesson to those who fear hospitals and taking care of themselves medically.The other case involved a Latino guy, a white woman, and a white dude.  When one officer states that he suspects prostitution may be an underlying matter here, his white female colleague responds, ""A white guy and a Hispanic fighting!?  It had to involve heroin!""  It turns out she was right.  However, I don't understand how the race and gender of the combatants were a signal of that.  The white guy actually ended up being chivalrous: he tried to take all the blame so that his female partner wouldn't be punished.  However, his female partner easily cracked.  It didn't take but a second for her to start crying and admit that this was a robbery gone wrong.  I don't know why folk on this show are crazy enough to steal from dealers, but this isn't the first time it's happened.One police officer is a chunky, Latino guy and it was funny to me that his last name was Osorio when ""oso"" in Spanish means ""bear.""  The white murder suspect says something shocking.  First, he said, ""Could I face the death penalty?"" and then he says, ""May I please face the death penalty?""  Perhaps this can be something from which drug addicts can learn.  I also hope the suspect gets the psychotherapy that he so obviously needs.",1313798400,2011-08-20

4.0,"Review based on first 4 episodes.I was skeptical at first, expecting this series to focus more on the Romeo and Juliet love story between the two leads. Thankfully, they move past that relatively quickly, which is a good thing since Matt Lanter and Aimee Teagarden have ZERO chemistry.  The focus is more on the clashing cultures of the humans and the aliens.I like that we explore the alien culture in-depth, and we discover that there is just as much diversty within that culture as within the human culture (i.e., just like not all humans are racist jerks, not all the Atrians are benevolent pushovers).  I am much more interested in Roman's story: trying to figure out what his dad was up to prior to his death, getting involved in the politics of his people, and trying to keep his fellow Atrians in line in order to make life better for all Atrians.I hope The CW renews this series, because it is good.",1395446400,2014-03-22

3.0,"As a fan of the original Bionic Woman, I am appalled by the liberties taken by the writers in this show. First of all, they have completely altered the story of Jamie Summers, the original Bionic Woman. The story presented in the series is COMPLETELY different. I don't undertand why they didn't just change her name.Second, the acting of Michelle Ryan is not the best. Still, I do think she is doing the best she can with what she has been given. But, she displays no emotion, barely any tears when crying. Her face looked completely emotionless when her fiance died or when she was at his funeral. The show just doesn't deal with her emotions. They have concentrated so much in the action and the lines that they have forgotten an important part of television, facial expressions and body language. The younger sister seems to be the only one displaying an emotional range in the show.The show is not that cohesive. They do not explain certain things. Why was the sister sentenced(?) or prohibited from using computers? The show just doesn't tie in things together.The show has a very nice visual style (hence my rating of 3 stars) and I think it has some potential, but a lot of things have to be fixed. These facilities, very low budget by the way, where she trains have really bad security and look like a basement. They should vamp up these settings and make them more hi-tech. The plotlines and the writing should deal more with how Jamie feels about all of this. She took everything so matter of fact (except for the initial screaming after her operation). Someone needs to wake her up and say ""Woman, you are Bionic! React! I would also like to know how she knows all these fighting techniques. Was some computer implanted into her head? I mean, she did not train for that long!In conclusion, the show has a lot of things that need fixing.

The acting is superb and the direction and production keep the viewer coming back episode after episode.  This series is unique in that MPD or Dissociative identity disorder (DID) has never been approached before on television besides the old movie Sybil.  United States of Tara gives a much more realistic view of how a typical family might deal with this.It's dark, it's funny and I found myself watching episode after episode in almost one sitting.

4.0,"This November, A&E;'s popular ""Duck Dynasty"" is getting an actual DVD release.  While the show has been available to purchase for quite some time, it was previously being sold as a DVD-R on demand product.  That means that it was pressed onto discs when you purchased it as opposed to it being packaged for sale at a store near you.  Well, I guess they sold enough units to make it a viable DVD release because, for those that haven't experienced the show, it's coming out in a three disc set.WARNING:  BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHICH VERSION YOU ARE BUYING!  They are both still for sale on this site and all of these reviews are lumped together under both.  So read the description carefully if you want the new version with a Bonus disc of extra footage.Other than the extra disc, the Season One release still retains the fifteen episodes of the show's premiere year for a total running time of approximately 5 1/2 hours.  The DVD also has a Spanish subtitle option.In short, ""Duck Dynasty"" is one of the new brand of reality programs that adheres to a pretty expected format.  Shows that employ a similar formula can be found all over the cable airwaves on channels such as Lifetime, A&E;, and even History.  I mention this up front because, like many of its cousins, this is a show that you will absolutely love or violently despise.  It introduces the Robertsons, a Louisiana bayou clan that has built a sporting goods business empire called Duck Commander.  They are living the dream as an unlikely success story.  As you might anticipate, though, this family is populated by wacky eccentrics espousing down home wisdom.  Are you laughing with the Robertsons or at the Robertsons?  And does it really matter?As with the other shows in this genre, many of the escapades seemed designed for TV (as opposed to being natural).  Once again, though, I'm not sure that it matters.  The hook is that you want to see this clan (that you might describe as hillbilly or redneck) thrive in humorous ways.  Although everyone in the family is quite different, there is an underlying respect and love that makes this warmer and more affectionate than you might think possible.  Either the show is for you or not.  If you've never seen an episode, I might suggest catching one on TV where they rerun frequently or watching one on-demand here to see if it is to your liking.  And if you love the show, nothing else matters.  But remember, be careful which version of this product you are buying!  KGHarris, 10/12.",1351555200,2012-10-30
4.0,"Alpha House was a show that I really enjoyed and able to watch the episodes back to back since Amazon released the full season together.  I think Amazon is on the right track with this first outing of original television programming.  The show takes a humorous approach to how things work or more factually don't work within  Congress.Alpha House follows four Senators who also live together in Washington, DC.  The show features John Goodman as Senator Gil John Biggs, Matt Malloy as Senator Louis Laffer, Jr., Mark Consuelos as Senator Andy Guzman, and Clark Johnson Senator Robert Bettencourt.  John Goodman acts as the glue within the show and he definitely carry's the show.  The shows topics vary from episode to episode but basically revolve around Re-election battles, looming indictments, party fighting, and a lot of drinking.I enjoyed the show and I would definitely recommend it.Thank you for reading my review",1386201600,2013-12-05

4.0,"For those of us who unfortunately have not seen the original BANLIEUE 13 - aka DISTRICT 13 - (made in 2004 with the same crew except for the director - Pierre Morel), some of the background information that usually follows in a sequel is missing and according to many, the sequel here BANLIEUE 13:ULTIMATUM - aka DISTRICT 13: ULTIMATUM is not as strong a film.  And perhaps that allows the viewer to appreciate fine French film making without the comparison!Luc Besson (of the Trasnporter series et al) wrote this script (or rather, this plan of choreography, as there is not a lot of spoken dialogue in this fast-paced thriller) and Patrick Allessandrin directs a story of a region of Paris (District 13) that is cordoned off the rest of Paris by a group of five warlords who manage to control the drug ridden violent region.  Basically the tale is that of two men - Captain Damien Tomaso (Cyril Raffaelli) and undercover cop of the 'good' police and Leto (David Belle), an ex-thug who in the previous film infiltrated a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb.  That was supposedly in 2010.  The film opens some years later when District 13 is now in control of power over the government and the 'bad police' are attempting to destroy the area and rebuild according to their greedy plans.  The action is the story and the action is immensely exciting!  David Belle invented a discipline known as Parkour, which consists of moving quickly and efficiently in any environment, using only the abilities of the human body, and though his acting credits are minimal, he is stupefying in his live action role. Belle and Raffaelli are the reasons to watch this thriller as their screen chemistry is magnetic.  Other standout performances in the film include the much tattooed Elodie Yung as Tao (the principal gang queen), Philippe Torreton as the much oppressed President, and the evil appearing Daniel Duval as the nemesis who turns the keys of the plot.The cinematography is superb, the musical score is French rap music that while it suits the mood of the film becomes irritating in its repetitiveness.  In all this is an escape film that is high on excitement is not very high on intelligent dialogue.  But put Bell and Raffaelli together and the combustion is authentically credible.

5.0,"Helix is a good, fast moving tv show.  The show is not about zombies as some have stated. Instead it's about a corporation of immortals who want to wipe out the world with a virus.  The sets are great here and the show is well worth keeping up with.  As you try to figure out what's happening..  Hopefully the series will get another season as they plan to have very different storylines and perhaps different characters each season.  Helix is worth watching as there is nothing else on tv like it.  Scy fy did a great job with this one.  the acting is good as you would hope and it's cool to have a Japanese lead in a American tv show. Helix will give a good sci fi fix and it's engaging a quick paced too.  l",1395619200,2014-03-24
4.0,"I never watched Eureka while it was on TV so Ive spent the last few weeks binge watching and now I'm wondering why I wasn't watching it when it was on the air. Overall its a pretty good show, but having watched it all in a short amount of time has given me a little perspective too. I felt like the show was least interesting during the last part of season 2 and most of season 3, with a pretty good rebound for 4 and 5. I also enjoyed watching the show get a little more serious towards the end and wish it had more of that throughout the series. Yes, you have to suspend your disbelief a bit when it comes to the science and how Eureka manages to practically blow up the earth every episode, but its fun to watch. The end of the series was also one of the best that Ive seen for many tv shows out there and think they did a great job connecting the beginning and end of the series. I love the characters in the show and think they all did a great job playing their parts and working well together. Nathan Stark was a good character that I was sad to see leave and I really liked seeing Fargo go from being annoying to really being pretty bad ass at the end. The one real issue I had with the series was the Carter/Allison relationship just didn't work for me. Early in the series I could see it, but once she went back to Nathan Stark I disliked ever seeing them together. It really felt like Carter should have ended up with Tess or even Lupo more than Allison, but again, that's a storyline that goes back to the beginning of the show so we all knew it was probably going to end the way it did even if the show evolved to the point it probably shouldn't have happened. Overall Eureka is really fun to watch and worth seeing if you havent already.",1374105600,2013-07-18

5.0,"Midsomer Murders was rather refreshing after watching police procedurals such as Wire In The Blood: Completely Wired - Series 1-6 Collection [NON-U.S.A. FORMAT: PAL Region 2 U.K. Import] and Touching Evil: Complete Collection. The two latter shows are great crime dramas, but much more gritty and gruesome than Midsomer Murders.Amazon Prime members are able to view Midsomer Murders' episodes via instant download for free and I must say the stories are engaging and interesting. Set in the bucolic English villages in Midsomer County, the murders that occur here(at an alarmingly high rate, one might add) are in stark contrast to the serene beauty of the English countryside.DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) resides with his wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) in the country town of Causton, where the Criminal Investigation Department is located. Tom is a meticulous investigator and an astute observer of human nature. His methodical investigative methods and keen eye contrast with his young DS Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) who is not very PC and often blunders to the wrong conclusion regarding the identity of a particular murderer.There is a Gothic feel to many of the crimes, which is enhanced by the unique music chosen to accompany a particular episode. At times, certain scenes seem overly exaggerated, but to me, they only add to the charm of the show. This is a great example of atmospheric crime dramas with a wonderful ensemble cast and riveting storylines. Midsomer Murders will appeal to fans of British cozy mysteries, where blood and gore take a backseat to wit and humor, and the focus is on investigations set amidst a bucolic, close-knit setting.",1321920000,2011-11-22

5.0,"You know, I don't normally put my review titles in all caps. But what can I say? This show is... well, BRILLIANT! I've always thought that there are far, far too many five star reviews here on amazon. But if there ever was a show that genuinely deserved a rave, this is it.Archer is a wonderfully absurdist frolic for strictly adult audiences. Fundamentally this show is a giant spoof of 1960s spy thrillers; a spoof made for decidedly 21st century sensibilities. It's the show Get Smart would have been had all the characters been perpetually high on crystal meth.In fact, the characters on Archer are all selfish, petty, and utterly and completely venal: the three great ingredients from which comedy is made. They seem to think and act more like deranged adolescents than grown-ups. Deranged adolescents with access to firearms. Add all this together and you get some idea of the flavor of the show. Archer is very much in the spirit of the original Williams Street adult swim cartoons, but is never merely derivative of them. Which of course is exactly what you'd expect, given that this show is produced by Adam Reed, whose previous producing and directing credits include both Sealab 2021 and Frisky Dingo. Indeed, Reed's voice credits go all the way back to the original Space Ghost Coast to Coast.But while a similar sense of humor can be found throughout, Archer definitely has a flair all of its own. Visually it has kind of a pseudo-realist ""ligne claire"" (clear line) style that matches perfectly with the creatively anachronistic world the characters inhabit. Cell phones and other contemporary technologies may abound, but jet-age fashions still prevail, and the KGB and the Soviet Union remain major adversaries.But the first thing long time hard core animation fans will notice is that voice of H. Jon Benjamin brings its own uniquely laconic comic genius to the title role of ""Archer"" himself. Many of us remember Benjamin best as Coach from Home Movies. Others may recognize his voice from various bit parts in Family Guy and the Venture Bros.. But wherever you know him from, I for one am overjoyed that a suitable vehicle has finally been found for this great talent.Better yet, Benjamin is complemented by scarcely lesser talents such as Aisha Tyler, a standup comedian who plays Lana Kane, another top operative at the same spy agency; and Jessica Walter, who plays the head of the agency - who also just happens to be Archer's mother. However, I should stress that this rather unusual combination of relationships is never reduced to mere sit-com hijinx. Archer is the kind of show were things get genuinely disturbing. In fact, this is one of those rare shows where the entire cast is incredibly strong - and backed up by an equally strong writing team, too.What more can I say? See it!Theo.",1288310400,2010-10-29

While Monica & Chandler having babies was nice and giving Phoebe more play early on the season as she marries the laconic Mike were nice touches the misses were felt such as having Chandler become so dispassionate toward so many situations (other than the baby) to the point that his character was moving toward being unlikable and having Rachel stay behind for Ross (why!?!?!?) didn't allow for a settled closure to their relationship and maddens me!Still, a series that was brightly colored and deftly dipped into deep emotional territories without becoming heavy-handed or maudlin.

5.0,"Every bit of the drama on the show is just WOW really they did that. I have been following the show since the beginning. I'm also a NCIS LA fan when they did merge the two shows (NCIS LA and NCIS) together in a episode in Season 6 or 7, I think, well not really a merge of shows yet but more of an Intro to NCIS LA. The show's characters really seem to work together very well. Also I will say this much they do seem to try to keep the foul language to a minimum which shows good character, example for children that watch the show. Cause shows with foul language every other word just shows that it's such low class with writers with poor language skills. So with this show as far as keeping the language tame in comparison to many other shows I would let my children watch this over the others just for that reason alone. This show has class and I for see them being successful in it's 11th season and beyond.  I believe whenever NCIS has it's final episode NCIS LA will continue and maybe last just as long, and maybe they should have the two shows do more merging once in a while cause these days the left hand in the military knows what the right hand is doing. And in many cases they work hand in hand together. Both Shows are Excellent. I own all the episodes from start to present. Starting from season 1 to present, of NCIS. The TV pass really helps keep the price down to do that and much easier to manage my library on line than on a book shelf. If you like CSI, 24 or shows like it, this has it and then some, tons of action, and drama as well as some comic relief.If this was a book, it would be like one of those books that you start reading and just can't put it down until you get to the end. It's that good of a show. And if you are just starting out watching I'd highly recommend you go back to season 1 and start from the beginning cause you'll have many missing pieces to this puzzle. If you wanna to do it cheaply by just watching them all til you get to this current season and you haven't sold yourself as to how much you like it, I'd start with a Net flicks account DVD's and do 3 or 4 at a time and start there, then go Amazon or start buying a season at a time and get a TV pass for the current season. If you have little time to watch TV and can watch that much at once then I'd get the TV pass now for the current season so your rates are low per episode. Watch the net flicks til your as far as you can go then switch over to Amazon and if net flicks don't have season 10 yet, If by then you like it you'll want to buy it on instant video and might even buy the others as well so you can go back and watch anytime you like. Lots of times it's cheaper to if planning to own it all to buy them on the Amazon Instant Video then you don't have a bulky box with DVD's in it that can get scratched or broken plus, if your downloaded version from Amazon gets corrupted you can re-download it free, if your DVD gets broken you can't get a free replacement.DVR's and Amazon Instant Video (AIV) of which you can get a TV pass and never miss an episode which is great. DVR's no TV pass it will record what it see's on TV but if you like recording commercial's and  weather reports, or special news or the president talking DVR might be your thing. (AIV) Plus the bonus by having it digitally I can watch it anywhere I have internet or download it on to your PS3 or PC or a Memory Stick or external Mega 1T drive or bigger and have all my shows and watch them with out the internet once downloaded (so when power goes out one night and your laptop is charged up you could watch your favorite shows you downloaded {using the Amazon UnBox Video program of which is a free download on Amazon (AUBV)} out of your Video Library on (AIV), which is great when traveling. Just plug in the PC to the Big Wide screen TV or projector and watch the show and have a family movie night. Anyway the other good thing is when the big storm happened on the east coast last year. The Stations had blocked out the shows and was cutting in doing News so what ever the episode was didn't get to see it with the DVR but with the TV Pass I was able to watch it. Other bonus don't have to worry about the DVD getting broken. I love this Idea of the TV pass and instant video's It's nice No more storing massive collections of video tapes or DVD's anymore I can keep my collection downloaded to my PC and easel look up and find the show I'm looking for in one big large file with all my shows on it. I haven't tried the cloud thing yet but I'm  thinking of giving it a go. Over all this Show Rocks never a boring episode at least not yet. If you want to watch it and keep it TV Pass the way to go. You'll have your collection before those waiting for it to go DVD. As far as  storing my (AUBV's) I like using the Memory Stick mainly because if something happens to my hard drive on my PC I'm protected with it on the stick. I imagine the cloud thing would be just as nice in that respect. So I say Enjoy it once you start doing it, it might be hard to stop using the Amazon Instant Video or the Amazon UnBox Video on your computer, Tivo, ps3, or Roku which is nice cause with the Roku you just need internet and no downloading required with it. Anyway it's lots of fun, and really easy to use even for us old guys in our 50's. Enjoy you'll love it.",1379808000,2013-09-22

I watched it in a marathon over a cold winter weekend. The second season kept my interest and I watched it over another winter weekend. It is still interesting but not as much as the first two seasons. I didn't like some of the character changes and some of the original character such as Hudson & James Bellamy became a bit irritating to me. If you liked seasons #1, #2, #3, #4 & Downton Abbey, give it a watch. I watched it to finish out the series. It is not as good as the previous seasons. I will say that the last episode with Rose Buck, Jean Marsh, leaving the house was sentimental.

4.0,"Arrow - The First Season  [548 2014-06-20]Summary:Oliver Queen - rich playboy - is ship wrecked then marooned for five years on a remote island. He returns home with a crime fighting agenda using the disguise of a hooded archer. His purpose is not clearly defined, something about bringing to justice individuals on a list of urban exploiters from a notebook handed to him by his father - just before he blew his brains out. Needless to say Oliver gets some push back from the local authorities, the underworld bosses, his mother and his pals.The creative team for ""Arrow"" had to somehow integrate a comic hero - The Green Arrow - and a contemporary action TV series utilizing, of course, real actors. How well this concept has been successful is a judgment left to the individual viewers, but as of the date of these comments the show has been renewed for a third season. As they say vox populi vox Dei.Content:The Season One package consists of 5 disks and 20 episodes originally show on the CW Network during the period October 2012 through May 2013. Also included are several special features on disk 5 that I founding modestly interesting.Positive Comments: Many episodes include deleted scenes, which are not to be missed. Some are quite lengthy and are interesting and informative concerning that particular episode. The deleted scenes are identified with an icon next to the episode titles - a helpful viewers aid. Season One developed a few reoccurring themes which added to the interest of the show as the episodes were viewed. Each episode tackles two plot lines: one detailing Oliver's misadventures on the Island during his 5-year involuntary vacation and that episodes justice seeking adventures. The action sequences are quite intensely interesting. One of the season 1 features informs us the Olive has no ""super-hero"" talents but damned if I could tell how a human being could survive some of the jams he falls into. I watched the DVD in sequence and with the deleted scenes and the few extras ""special feature' found it was worth the purchase price.The Cast: Steven Amell as Oliver Queen is more that adequate for the demanding emotional and physical role he is cast in. David Ramsey as John Diggle Oliver's sidekick is a plus.Negative Comments: Each episode uses the identical ""canned"" introduction - I wish there was a way to skip over this redundant intro. There are a number of important plot events placed in motion in season 1. If you miss several shows you may by scratching your noggin asking what's this all about. Not the show you can skip and come back too. I found it hilarious that all the young ladies and men in this show were just knockout beautiful and handsome - and, oh yes, dressed to the nines - just unbelievable.Recommendations:To be honest this show is mindless viewing candy. I found it entertaining but refrained from trying to look for any kind of plot logic to the drama. Just enjoy the nice looking people, convoluted story line and wild action sequences.",1403222400,2014-06-20
5.0,"DCI Tennison gains her staff's acceptance but all is not as conciliatory with the murder investigation of a black corpse found in a black neighborhood. London's citizens and police force have some race issues. Then there's Jane's hot new ""sleep-with.""""PRIME SUSPECT"" is also available, boxed as ""The COMPLETE COLLECTION"". A bargain compared to individual segments. If you are just finding Prime Suspect, you WILL want all 7 years. Not just tales of cops and murder, but in-your-fact realistic cop activity, which was done with so much realistic detail, it was the show to change British (and world) crime shows forever. It is the gritty type of show that all mystery film and TV now try to duplicate. Police drama was changed forever by Helen Mirren and her role as Jane Tennison.Be aware, the cases may not always end to your satisfaction--just like real life crimes and punishment. But you will be on the edge of your seat while you watch. Compelling viewing, ruthless in the detail, definitely not for children and the squeamish, blatantly course visually and in dialogue, but oh, so realistic. This show has won 7 Emmys and always includes guest stars aplenty.Helen Mirren makes the show as Tennison. Obsessed, work-driven, feminist attitude, course, in-your-face drive, compellingly believable, more man-like rather than the occasional romantic which does exist, she's a drinker, and she almost never smiles.Subtitles for this series.Tennison not only colors outside the box, she makes the box.",1314403200,2011-08-27

4.0,"I have always been a fan of Leslie Mann, ever since her turn as Matthew Broderick&#8217;s love interest in 1996&#8217;s &#8220;The Cable Guy&#8221;. She is inherently cute and charming. She&#8217;s the kind of actress that no matter what she is doing, you can&#8217;t help but love her. While her characters from movie to movie don&#8217;t tend to vary all that much, she is still absolutely perfect in &#8220;The Other Woman&#8221;.Mann plays Kate King, the wife of a multi-million dollar business start-up expert. Her husband is always travelling and if you paid to see the movie or in the least read the title of the movie, you most certainly know what is going to happen. Insert Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz), who thinks she&#8217;s met the man of her dreams and Amber (supermodel Kate Upton), who joins the shenanigans as well.The thing about &#8220;The Other Woman&#8221; is that if you know anything about the movie and/or have seen the trailer, you pretty much know everything there is to know about it, except for how it ends. That is probably the biggest downfall of the movie. The movie isn&#8217;t all that complicated once the relationships are all exposed. Also, there are a few too many montage and music video moments that would have been better served with just natural sound, especially an emotional and important scene near the end.On the good side, &#8220;The Other Woman&#8221; may have its problems with simplicity, but it goes miles upon miles upon the charm of its stars. Mann, Diaz and Upton are electric together. The scenes that they spend together bantering are extremely realistic and natural. There wasn&#8217;t a single moment watching them that I pondered upon the fact that they were just acting; even Upton, who&#8217;s only played bit parts in two other movies. They were like sisters and it came across.Personality goes a long way with me in movies because it is those things that we connect with and relate to as an audience. While this may primarily be a movie that takes man bashing to a new extreme, anybody who has been in a fidelity situation will relate. Leslie Mann makes this movie worth viewing in her own right. If you don&#8217;t ride along with her emotional roller coaster and fall in love with her, you don&#8217;t have a pulse.",1398384000,2014-04-25

It was much different in my perspective from the past seasons, but that does not mean you don't get great music, dancing and acting as you have gotten in previous seasons. I was wondering in this season how they were going to continue on after some of the main characters graduated, but the writers did a great job and kept the plot moving on, not in a forced way in any sense. The plot in this season was compelling and made me want to continue watching from episode to episode which is exactly what I was hoping for when I started watching.

There is enough going on to keep the kids entertained (age 10) and there is a lot of humor geared towards adult viewers.  And anyone with kids knows, finding shows like that is a real plus.  That said, there are usually one or two episodes in each season that we don't let the kids watch due to more adult themes, but all in all it's a pretty safe bet.

There are supposedly several types of trolls, but viewers get to see only 2 types briefly. The filming pretty good quality, but there is little suspense as you know this is supposed to be found footage, thus the viewer knows from the start that the film crew didn't survive the super fast and confused attack at the end of the film.  I thought it was a fun idea to use the troll concept, but the idea was wasted. Most of the film is trying to locate living trolls, chasing the clues, and then there are the quick moments during which we actually see a troll. The CGI is good but goes by too quickly to enjoy.

2.0,"Here we have your standard creature feature with nearly every cliched element represented. You've got a group of cocky youngsters in a lake where there's no cell phone reception. You've got a curious mismatch of personalities, from the creepy loner to the blonde tease to the nerdy filmmaker wannabe and (of course) the alpha male joke. I mean, jock. You've even got a wizened old man who warns them about impending danger (they ignore the old fart, natch). Watch as they take a row boat into the middle of a lake and begin getting picked off, one by one, by some kind of giant, carnivorous fish.Let's start with the only thing that works. I almost gave this movie one star but I decided not to solely because of the performances. These kids aren't portraying any group of seniors you'd ever want to know in real life, but at least they threw themselves into their roles wholeheartedly. The majority of them did pretty decent jobs, so kudos to the cast. It's too bad that the writing and directing were so completely inept that it turned the acting into frosting on a turd cake.This is not to say the characters were any good. You've got Johnny, the morose moron who actually knew about the fish and didn't try to stop his so-called friends as they gadded about in the water. He spends 90% of his screen time sulking, scowling, and pouting for no real reason. It looked for all the world like they cast him just to give the film a poor man's replica of another Johnny -- Depp. Watch him emote! And demonstrate a total lack of responsibility or skill! There's the nebbish Zeke, who spends the bulk of the film either pitying or glorifying himself. There's three other people, including that blonde who is just plain enough to flirt shamelessly with everyone. The end result: they're all horrible jerks.I blame the script. The film is trying to make a point, believe it or not, about how loyalties and friendship can be strained when death is on the line, but it makes the point in a bumbling and repetitive way. Plus, given that every single one of these people is despicable and annoying, there's absolutely no ""will-they-won't-they"" tension to the story. In fact, roughly forty minutes into the film I found my allegiances changing over to the fish. ""Hurry up, fish,"" I thought. ""What are you waiting for?"" Instead of providing some kind of sympathetic figure to give the tale forward momentum, you've got people yelling and crying and endangering each others' lives for no reason other than because it's dramatic. Or supposed to be.Speaking of forward momentum, let's talk about how it takes five healthy kids something like ten hours to paddle a boat approximately two to three hundred yards to shore. The film wants you to feel like they're trapped in the middle of this lake (the fish quickly dispatches of their oars, but only because they idiotically use them to jab at the thing whenever it gets near), but it seems highly unlikely, since we are shown that the stuff they throw out of the boat (junk food, etc.) washes up on the shore hours before the end of the film. Even if you accept that the boat is somehow in a dead zone, they come up with the bright idea to vote people off the boat to distract the fish so that they can then paddle with their hands to the shore. The first time they do this, it buys them a paltry thirty seconds of time. But they keep doing it, over and over, and -- what a shock -- it never gets them anywhere.With a concept like this, viewers will be astonished less by the B-grade effects of the fish (when it's underwater, it seems pretty well done, but it surfaces enough times for you to sense that it's a glorified balloon) or by the violent turns these friends make, and more by how everything is essentially the result of stupid people being stupid. That's only good cinema if you're making a comedy. Sometimes B-grade horrors like this can be so bad they're funny, but such is not the case here. The film is a joke, for certain, but it takes itself so seriously that it inspires less friendly enjoyment and more irritated head shakes. If they remade it from the fish's point of view, it would probably be silly enough to be good times, but as it is, it's nothing but fairly talented young actors pouring their hearts out for weak, watery schlock.",1374710400,2013-07-25

4.0,"Peter Cameron's story SOMEDAY THIS PAIN WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU is coming of age tale that is, at turns, funny, sad, tender, and sophisticated. As adapted for the screen by director Roberto Faenza with Cameron and Dahlia Heyman this becomes an experimental film that will delight many and confuse some. The cast is excellent and once the audience moves into the rhythm of the narrated story it is difficult not to re-live youth and pull for the lad whose story this is.James Sveck (Toby Regbo) is a lonely young teenager who is tortured by his grossly unstable home environment and is fraught with hating people, suicidal thoughts, depression, and the preference for solitude.  It is the summer before he goes off to college at Brown University and he is conflicted: his vain lothario father (Peter Gallagher) insists that he go to college, his gallery owner mother (Marcia Gay Harden) has just returned form Las Vegas and her third failed marriage - this time to a compulsive gambler (Stephen Lang); his sister Gillian (Deborah Ann Woll) is writing her memoir and falling for an older married Polish professor; and James is working with his mother's gallery director (Gilbert Owuor), trying to make since of art, people, relationships and the chaos of the world that confuses him - the last thing he wants is to enter the college world. His mother lines him up with a Life Coach (Lucy Liu) and slowly James begins to come to grips with a past bad memory and to learn to accept who he is as someone worth living. James only loving connection to the world is his grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) and from her he learns a lot about the vagaries of life and how to cope. The story is told in the first person narration which helps give an intimate inside view of James as he works through his life at the therapy sessions which his parents insist he attend and it is in this manner that we learn about James's past and present through the stories he tells and his recounting of previous therapy sessions and the ambivalences and uncertainties of adolescence.The film manages to balance teenage angst and relationship failures with an equal amount of drama and comedy.  This is one of those films that linger in memory long after the final credits. Grady Harp, October 12",1350172800,2012-10-14

I Watched the 1st two episodes and turned it off in the middle of the 2nd one.It's scripted and stupid.i.e. - They really want you to believe that the one brother (on his own) flooded out their loading dock so that ducks would come and they can test out their duck calls!!! Really!!!Even though the opening of the show, shows them at a local lake hunting ducks...with their duck calls.If they want to test their calls, why not just go to the lake? Instead they flood their loading dock, with a hose. That had to take a couple of days easily.Dumb show.",1396396800,2014-04-02

5.0,"Perhaps being an Army Brat and remembering the 'stories' of WWII makes this all the more poignant. To listen to these men recount their memories is to recognize the bonds formed during combat. Friendship and trust that has remained through the years and been passed on to their children and grandchildren. Their training began in Georgia and saw them through places that have been immortalized in  films . . . 'A Bridge Too Far?' Yes, Operation Market Garden was a reality for these men. Their stories  allow one to follow their path from army training,  airborne training at Ft. Benning,  Georgia,  even more training in England, their landing at Normandy, and finally 'back home.' These men should be listened to for they have so much to share. The narrative is well done, includes interviews and photographs. Listen, if you will, and remember!7 January 2014: Now that I've viewed other Tim Gray Amazon instant videos, I decided to view this one again. The members of 'Easy Company' certainly had a great deal to contribute to the understanding of other WWII serieses. A venture into the past with this 'Band of Brothers!'",1378252800,2013-09-04

He takes on cases that often have excellent plots and the interaction and caring of his staff is wonderful. This is a mystery/drama above all else, but can be funny and touching at the right times.

4.0,"first, i could watch anything with Andre Braugher in it.  he was abaolutely wonderful in the latest ray romano vehicle about three middle aged friends.  i was sad when that show was cancelled as he had done a brilliant job as the son taking over the family business, he plays the captain of the nuclear sub here. however, i am worried about some of the rest of the casting, there is a huge remaining cast which seems to have been primarily picked for looks over talent, especially all of the women in the cast. Andre Braugher going head to head with ray romano is one thing.  his being stranded on a tropical isle with a cast which looks straight outof a lifeguard show is quite another.the premise is interesting but sticks us with this huge cast on a tropical isle. essentially, a US nuclear sub goes rogue with Andre Braugher at the helm. it is now at war with the US and is located with 17 nuclear warheads on an island formerly occupied by NATO. the ship went rogue when it received a possibly bogus attack order to annhilate pakistan.this show could go either way but it needs a fast infusion of other first rate acting talent.",1349395200,2012-10-05

3.0,"THis is a somewhat low key, hard scifi film.  It doesn't go for cheap thrills or preposterously silly outcomes, but instead follows a mystery to the end with few frills.  That being said, there is plenty of action and legitimate fear, the joy of discovery, and realistic tensions and relationships within a team that lives in close quarters for a long time.  It is well done.As with many goods works of scifi, there is a mystery that must be solved that is essentially scientific.  Beyond the question of searching for ET life, you have to wonder what happened to the mission.  Their work is extremely dangerous, which is very well portrayed, but their inspiration and mission propel them forward.  I liked the way that the recovered transmissions were put together in a kind of retrospective documentary that reveals what finally happened in tiny bits, saving the most significant for last.THough there were few known actors, I also thought the acting was well done.  It's just that they were techies and scientists, whose concerns were rather recondite, but whose passion is apparent.  They bonded as a team, cared for each other, and felt losses very keenly.Overall, I would recommend this for renting but not purchasing - you probably won't want to watch it more than once because it is so low key.",1386633600,2013-12-10

5.0,"Another great season of this compelling show. This time the Hour reporters are on the trail of corrupt police and politicians. In the process of getting at the truth, betrayals abound, none more so than when the characters betray themselves. Hector wants to live life in a shallow puddle, as does his trophy wife Marnie, but both achieve an almost heroic status by the end of the show. New head Randall Brown is a breath of fresh air, albeit a neurotic one, and his chemistry with Lix is great. Line up the paper clips, everyone!  Bel goes through several crises of her own but finally comes to terms with her feelings for all the men in her life.True hero status goes to Freddie in the end, for the issues he tackles head on, even if he does make some serious blunders, especially with new character Camille, the worst part of this otherwise excellent show. The supporting characters that help put the program together round it all out nicely and make this a fascinating glimpse into the dawn of modern Britain as it became. Can't wait for the next season. British TV and acting at its best.",1376006400,2013-08-09

4.0,"I enjoy the shows. it is well written and acted. The one point that makes me uncomfortable is the way they have to lie to their children. The children are absolutely young Americans and their undercover communist espionage agent parents are making them live and believe a huge lie. It is very uncomfortable for me to watch this big lie, go on and on and casts a shadow over what should be a good spy story. The parents never seem to face this part of their lives or the effect it will ultimately have on their children. I think this is one of the most real and difficult aspics of the program the writers will have to deal with. If they don't they are missing what could be the most important and poignant part of the story. We already know about espionage and counter espionage. What we don't know is what goes on underneath the surface. That is the real story.",1395532800,2014-03-23

4.0,"Surprisingly good movie!  Let's be real, though.  The story is a bit predictable--but not totally so.  The love story is rushed and a bit melodramatic--but not vomit-inducingly so.  Relationships form naturally.  The scenes are believable and enjoyable.More importantly, the action is highly entertaining.  The fight scenes are well-choreographed.  The special effects are impressive!  When the volcano starts its troubles, wow!  You will get to see some incredible disaster scenes.  While you wait, you get gladiator battles worth re-watching.  Good violent stuff.As far as the acting goes, you can expect solid performances.  This is not B-movie trash.  Very well-done.  The settings as well  are beautiful and gritty, very accurate.Definitely worth renting.  This is not a waste of money by any means.  Yes, it veers from history a bit.  But not enough to complain.  Pretty close to the horrors they suffered in real life.",1400630400,2014-05-21

5.0,This show was really good. Everyone did a great job on it and as you can only imagine Charlie did a great job playing the long lost (or imprisoned) son in this movie. I was curious what he would be like apart from sons of anarchy but I was definitely not disappointed. In addition I can not remember the actors name but he plays the criminal in this flick and he also did an incredible job. I would definitely say that it was well worth watching. In fact I will probably watch it again.,1353024000,2012-11-16
5.0,"This season continues to please with it's twists & turns. When characters behaving predictably, it is believably so. The last episode clearly shows that the season ended and the producers pulled the plug without completing the story line, leaving the audience wondering what happens next?

However, she solves cases brilliantly.  Watch this, you will enjoy it.",1370476800,2013-06-06
5.0,"Loved this movie, every second of it! You really have to let your mind go when you watch this, you have to be very open in filling in blanks too as even though there is a story here its deep dark and very surreal in every way, if you have a good imagination then this is certainly the movie for you, the story starts with the alien almost being born as such on our world and we see her going around picking up men to feed on them, like species in a way I guess, the death scenes are weird and surreal, the whole movie is bleak and it has an eerie soundtrack which really sets the tone great, probably one of the best scores this year, Scarlett Johansson is amazing and looks amazing, there's not a whole lot of dialogue here, most of the time the actions and the surroundings do the talking, Johansson is fully naked in some scenes and looks stunning but it all relates to her character, as the movie goes on she begins to change and almost loose herself and gets caught up in the human side, well there's a few ways to looks at it really but I leave that up to you to decide, we do finally see under the skin towards the end in a beautiful CG scene, like I said this is a love it or hate it movie its not like your usual sci-fi and don't follow conventional rules of a movie, it leaves blanks and slight confusion so be alert and absorb everything you see so you can come up with your own final conclusions, very artistic movie that's well made and acted by the beautiful Johansson, certainly worth checking out if you think you can handle it.",1405382400,2014-07-15

3.0,"The star (his name escapes me) is somewhat pretty and he knows it. He could use some humility lessons. Come to think of it though, at his age, I was probably the same way. I was reared in Florida and the one thing I remember about &#34;The Glades&#34;, and no native I remember ever used that term, is the smell. The odor was a funky, stifling, brackish, oppressive almost indescribable stink that always repulsed me. The only individuals that liked the odor were the critters that called it home.All the actors in this series seem to be aware of themselves and of course the ever present camera. Only occasionally do they become lost in their roles. This may be due to the sometimes weak plots. I mean I doubt I could get interested in a case about illegally imported, endangered birds. Of course it's a serious problem but not one worthy of a crime show plot. Still sometimes, the installments are mediocre enough to watch. I guess that's the reason I still tune the program in.",1396396800,2014-04-02
4.0,"certainly this a good glimpse into the future. However it may be ten to 20 years later or so then the date for this shows reality.  However , the cars would certainly not be gasoline powered. I don't know if these are in the show though.  Anyways it's a attractive show about a cop and his android partner. It is still a basic cop show but today effects allow us to see a reasonable view of what the future may hold .  Of course in 25 years someone may be watching this and commenting on how it's either too advanced or not enough! This will be lucky to be renewed unfortunately.  It's expensive to make and the shows characters need more development, the captain character should feature more into story lines probably.  Still it's a good show and worth watching. I hope it gets a chance to make it to next year. It's no blacklist though, it's more mundane , but it's still great to have a well made sci fi show that could actually become reality someday.",1389484800,2014-01-12

1.0,"I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the ""hype"" surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media.  This show is another one of those ""con"" jobs.  Sorry, folks, but this show is just plain lousy.  It's depressing.  It goes nowhere.  The characters constantly bicker and fight.  Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, unsympathetic.  In short, this show was torture to watch.  And still believing the hype, I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3, hoping, praying, the show would somehow get better.  It doesn't.  The premise is good.  It could have been a good show.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikeable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that does not evolve--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good.  Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad in this.  His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry.  The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show.",1336867200,2012-05-13
5.0,"It's that vaunted chemistry and the rich emotional content, and it's those terrific touches of humor. In ""The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond"" there's a great throwaway moment brought about by a publisher's crediting part of Temperance Brennan's success as a mystery author to her looks. Brennan decides to quit writing, and here's Booth talking fast to change her mind:- Brennan: ""I don't want to be a sexy scientist!""- Booth: ""Well, that's like me saying I don't want to be a sexy FBI Agent. We can't change who we are!"" And then Booth starts quoting a published review of one of her mysteries. One of those perfect throwaway moments.World-renowned forensic anthropologist Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan is as brusque and tactless as ever, as confounded by the subtleties of social decorum as ever (or as Sweets exclaims: ""She is wicked literal!""). Bones is still very much that intimidating icy intellect, still a wounded soul, and still solving murders. FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth is still the one with the people skills and that well-developed bump of intuition. More onions are peeled in this season as we learn even more about the underpinnings of our core characters. The absolute big draw of this show is that sizzle between David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel, their fabulous interplay tantalizing and frustrating the viewers. Could this be the season that they get together? Well, kind of, sort of. Taking what the show is giving, I wallow in their ever evolving relationship.Staying on the personal, Hodgins and Angela are trying to move past their break-up. ""The Skull in the Sculpture"" demonstrates that Angela is more ready to move on than Hodgins, and if you thought Angela was a free spirit before, well, now...  This episode also has Sweets demonstrating the best way ever to fire someone. Young FBI psychologist Lance Sweets, by the way, becomes a regular cast member in this season, and I like him more and more as each episode progresses, even if Booth and Bones continually treat him like a pesky little brother. Even Dr. Saroyan's past is delved into.Zack Addy, apprentice to the Gormagon Killer, has been institutionalized, which doesn't keep him from strolling out to help the squints on a baffling case. Still, this gives rise to a running theme, that of the rotating roster of interns as Saroyan and Bones attempt to fill Zack's spot, and the fun thing is that each of these interns comes with baggage. There's the morbid one, the excessively chirpy one, the one constantly dispensing trivia, etc. The most martyred one may well be that repressed intern who insists on keeping things professional at all times - except that, the squints being a tight bunch, he keeps getting exposed to a deluge of innuendo and gossip in the workplace.***Possible plot SPOILERS begin***There isn't really a running mystery arc to tie these episodes together - no one like the Gormagon Killer running around, for example. But that doesn't mean that the cases aren't gripping; some of them are really interesting. The season opens with ""Yanks in the U.K."" (or, as I like to call it, ""Booth Vs. England""), which plants Brennan and Booth in jolly old England, investigating a murder and running into a British version of themselves. In ""The Passenger in the Oven"" Bones and Booth are on a flight bound to China and have only four hours to solve a murder before the plane lands and Booth loses jurisdiction. ""Double Trouble in the Panhandle"" has Booth and Bones infiltrating the Big Top as ""Buck & Wanda and their Knives of Death,"" and their circus act is actually fraught with more suspense than in just about any other scene in this season.Some other favorites? In ""The Double Death of the Dearly Departed,"" Bones and Booth steal a corpse due for cremation from a funeral home, Bones believing that the body had been ""translated,"" which is Booth's made-up code for murder. ""Mayhem on a Cross"" unveils some dark stuff about Sweets' past, this episode also featuring the return of the awesome Stephen Fry as FBI shrink Gordon Gordon Wyatt. It also had me cracking up whenever Bones insisted on correctly pronouncing ""skalle"" (the Norwegian word for ""skull""). ""The Hero in the Hold"" features the return of the Grave Digger serial killer. ""The Princess and the Pear"" plonks Bones and Booth's temp replacement in the world of comic book conventions, and Bones finally gets another chance to flash her martial arts mojo.In ""The Critic in the Cabernet"" Bones drops a bomb on Booth and Booth gets advice from a cartoon character, a frivolous conceit which goes on to have a terrifying payoff. Finally Season 4 closes with a quirky fantasy episode featuring a re-shuffling of roles. In this reality, Dr. Saroyan and Booth's brother are homicide detectives and Booth and Bones are a married couple who run a nightclub and who end up as suspects in a murder case. It's neat that just about everyone is in this one.***Possible plot SPOILERS end now***BONES - SEASON FOUR comes in six discs and includes 22 of the 26 episodes.

5.0,"This is the best reality detective show I've seen so far anywhere.  They don't use recreations, just the real thing, video, photos, evidence, etc, of the actual crime.  We get to follow the real gumshoe of tracking down the evidence, interviewing witnesses and family and friends, to see if there is enough to take to the DA and get a grand jury to indict.  Totally a new type of detective reality show and I sure hope there are more seasons to come.  If you are a reality detective junky like me, this is a must see.",1404000000,2014-06-29

She deserves credit.,1399852800,2014-05-12

3.0,"First-time director Tom Gormican, who also wrote this R-rated screenplay, gives us three buddies in the process of growing up (you are supposed to write what you know...smile...). They have a New York City pace to their repartee: very quick, acerbic and witty. The actors mastered the art of interrupting and talking over one another in a very natural way, while still managing to convey their dialogue. Not an easy task...We enjoy:* Zac Efron (&#34;The Lucky One&#34;) is Jason, one of our young men on the make, determined to stay single and &#34;live the life!&#34; He designs book covers.* Imogen Poots (&#34;A Late Quartet&#34;) plays Ellie, the gal he sees in a bar and diverts from a pickup artist so HE can pick her up. She conducts poetry seminars.* Miles Teller (&#34;The Spectacular Now&#34;) is Daniel, who works with Jason. He makes sure no one underestimates him; he has braggadocio down pat!* Mackenzie Davis (&#34;The F Word&#34;) Our tall, slender Chelsea, however, can see right through Daniel's smooth talk.* Michael B. Jordan (&#34;Fruitvale Station&#34;) plays Mikey, a young doctor who is in shock over his wife's infidelity.* Jessica Lucas (Lots of TV) is Vera, Mikey's estranged wife; she's just looking for more &#34;spontaneity.&#34; Who knew?Some things impressed us: all of our young adults have jobs; no one lives with his or her parents, although they all get along with them just fine; these are NOT stoners, not one hint of drugs is seen, and there are no pressing money problems. HOWEVER, the comedy is juvenile and raunchy, the language is profane, the behavior is VERY R-rated, and, I blush to admit, we laughed out loud regularly.No car chases, no guns, no blowie uppie stuff and the nudity is pretty much played for laughs. All in all, even though it was funny, it made me grateful that I do NOT have to go through these modern-day dating rituals. Yikes!",1393545600,2014-02-28
5.0,"The overall look (lighting, cinematography) of the show is great. The werewolve makeup relies too too much on sideburns and contact lenses.  The scripts, while slightly meandering, keep the intensity up to make you want more. Since the show is geared for the young MTV aduience, the cast is of course beautiful, but manage to hold their own. A very good sci-fi series which is a rarity.",1395014400,2014-03-17

5.0,"Started watching Walking Dead because I follow Chris Hardwick's Nerdist podcasts and pretty much enjoy most everything he gets nerdy over so I thought I had to at least give it a chance since he was such a huge fan w/his Talking Dead show. I watched Season 1 & 2 on Netflix in just two days and was so hooked I started paying for each episode on Season 3 via Amazon Prime... it was REALLY hard to wait for new episodes once I caught up with the season about mid-way through. I do not consider myself a big horror fan but this show is different (like everyone else says), the pace is basically perfect, and what I really like is all the twists and turns the characters take, and that no character is ever truly safe in this war zone like, zombie apocalypse world... no random red shirt appearances on this show for sure and every character whether you love 'em or hate 'em, well you never know how long they have!I do wish Amazon carried The Talking Dead after show as well. We haven't had cable for a year now and between Netflix, Hulu+ and Amazon Prime streaming/purchasing I am all set and only pay for the shows that really matter to me, like this one! Can NOT wait until Season 4! Seriously, you are missing an historic TV phenomenon if you aren't watching the Walking Dead!",1366329600,2013-04-19

3.0,This season we have once again dug up previous players only this time they threw in a family member as well.  The two worst decisions ever made by the producers of Survivor were when they brought back Jon Dalton in Survivor: Micronesia and if you watch the show you know how that went... and this season they brought back Colton Cumbie.  Really?  Well that went south quickly enough we weren't subjected to his whining for long.  So far I am not impressed with this season.,1382918400,2013-10-28
4.0,"I have been an enthusiastic fan of Justified since the pilot. I love all of the characters, and the actors and acting are first class.

5.0,"This show is so much fun and has lots of interesting characters that anyone who watches it will not be sorry they did so. Timothy Olyphant is Excellent in the title role as a US Marshall.

3.0,"""Ong Bak 2"" is a very misleading title. The film stars Tony Jaa of ""Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior,"" but ""Ong Bak 2"" is not a sequel. ""Ong Bak 2"" follows a totally different story with different characters and is set in different time. (Perhaps the only element that these two films have in common is a huge statue.) But be assured, Tony Jaa remains the same, as powerful and strong as ever, though you may not like some part of his new film, as I will explain later.Set in the 15th century Thailand, ""Ong Bak 2"" follows the story of Tien, a courageous young boy caught by a slave trader. Young Tien is in fact a prince whose parents have been murdered by a traitor. To survive and get revenge, he joins a group of bandits ""Garuda's Wing"" led by Chernang (Sorapong Chatree) and learns various fighting skills among them. After hard training, grown up Tien (Tony Jaa) is appointed as commander of the group.Tony Jaa's martial arts actions themselves are as amazing as ever, something that will never disappoint. For the new film Tony Jaa employs a wide variety of martial arts styles, plus many kinds of unique weapons such as nunchucks. Though some fight scenes are slightly repetitious, they remain thrilling throughout. Dan Chupong (""Born to Fight"") briefly appears as ""Crow Ghost"" and they provide an impressive battle scene at the climax. As to the acting, well, Tony Jaa is OK (a little too intense at times) and Sorapong Chatree steals every scene he is in.What is really regrettable is that the film considerably changed its narrative style from the original ""Ong Bak,"" in which a simple storyline really worked. Though ""Ong Bak 2"" (co-directed by Tony Jaa, later with Panna Rittikrai, Jaa's mentor and choreographer for the first ""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector"") has a lot of thrilling hard-hitting actions and incredible stunts (one involving running elephants), its revenge story, which should be simple and straightforward, is a bit too complicated and serious with a twist which I think is unnecessary. Also, the film ends rather abruptly, which is disappointing, but maybe I should wait for the next ""Ong Bak"" film.Obviously ""Ong Bak 2"" has better production designs and costumes than the first installment, but what we really need is Tony Jaa and his actions. Certainly ""Ong Bak 2"" gives it, but not in the most effective way.",1263600000,2010-01-16

5.0,"I am always looking for series to binge watch. My criteria include good writing, serious character development (usually all of the characters have &#34;flaws&#34; like the rest of us). Justified goes beyond those with fantastic dialogue (bordering on the poetic), great characters and acting all without taking itself too seriously. (No way so many dead bodies would go without notice in rural Kentucky).It is a series that my husband and I enjoy together. Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins are certain due to remain major actors in the future.",1394841600,2014-03-15

4.0,"I watched this show because I enjoy watching good dancing and the fast-paced, witty dialogue in shows like &#34;Gilmore Girls&#34;.  I knew this show was written by the same woman so thought I'd enjoy it.  Overall, I do enjoy it.  Some episodes are significantly funnier than others, and I wish Michelle drank a little less, but fans of &#34;Gilmore&#34; will enjoy.  I look forward to seeing the relationship between Michelle and Feeny deepen.",1360540800,2013-02-11
3.0,"""Centurion"" is what is called a ""hack and slash"" film from Neil Marshall, director of ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent,"" which means there are lots of gores, mutilated limbs and dead bodies. Blending raw violence and beautiful landscapes, ""Centurion"" has a potential for a sweeping saga with action, history and romance, but somehow the film itself, though it is not bad, ends up with dissatisfaction because of the generic storytelling and flat characters.Set in the second century Britain, a band of Roman soldiers is left behind the enemy lines after the surprise attack from the Pictish warriors. Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), who had survived the Pictish raid on the Roman frontier fort, is entrusted by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) of the Ninth Legion with the task of bringing the six survivors back to safety.Michael Fassbender is as brilliant as ever though his heroic character (and the romantic subplot) is underwritten. Olga Kurylenko appears as a fearsome warrior riding on a horse (and she doesn't speak a single word). She is not bad, but those who expect her to play another sexy ""Bond Girl"" as in ""Quantum of Solace"" might be disappointed.For me, the biggest problem with the film is that though ""Centurion"" delivers a few thrilling action scenes, the story itself is not that thrilling. We see a group of characters chased by another group of characters, but the chase scenes drag on, are at times repetitious, sometimes even look as if borrowed from somewhere else, like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""""Centurion"" is a blood-soaked period action that could have been better with fleshed-out characters and a tighter story.",1295913600,2011-01-25
4.0,"A movie that defies both facile description and easy categorization - is it an anarchic comedy, a sci-fi thriller, an apocalyptic, end-times parody? - ""John Dies at the End"" plays like a bad acid-trip caught on film. The Don Coscarelli scenario, based on the novel by Don Wong, focuses on two buddies, Dave and John, who become unwittingly involved with time-tripping, mind-reading, astral projection and a whole host of creep crawly creatures after each is injected with a strange black liquid given to them by a Jamaican mentalist. But do David and John have what it takes to enter the trans-dimensional portal and save the world from the evil forces attempting to cross over from the other side?Don't fret if you can't make heads or tails out of this manic and amusing tribute to the surreal and the absurd; instead, just sit back and enjoy the ride as director Coscarelli hurls us from one bizarre experience to the next. And you'd have to look far and wide to find better companions for the duration than Chase Williamson and Rob Mayes, two talented youngsters who not only slip right into the anarchic spirit of the enterprise but provide the grounding in reality that is so crucial to making this kind of thing work.",1373155200,2013-07-07

3.0,"I still love the show, but it gets really silly sometimes.  How many times can an FBI agent's wife be involved in a case?  It just seems so hokey how much they involve her in the cases and how she'll go all gung ho into a very dangerous situation with no weapons...and yet they always make it out ok.I love Mozzie, he keeps me coming back for more episodes!",1390867200,2014-01-28
4.0,"""Monsters and Mysteries in America"" is a surprisingly good series shown at Destination America. It features interviews with people who claim to have encountered various paranormal creatures, plus reconstructions of the events.The producers have made absolutely no attempt to verify the various stories. They could be absurd tall tales, for all we know. Despite this, the show works. Some of the people on it are pretty good story tellers. Regardless whether you believe in monsters or not, you will probably find this to be entertaining, certainly on a rainy day!I admit that some of the supernatural beasts shown on ""Monsters and Mysteries"" are just too bizarre to be believable. Come and meet the Sheep-squatch (you heard me). Or how about Justin Smeja, the man who claimed he shot a Bigfoot in the Sierras? (John Muir would have a few unkind comments about *that*!) The shape-shifting werewolf Rougarou of Louisiana is another sure attraction on our tour, as is the Honey Island Swamp Monster, a Bigfoot-like creature with webbed, reptilian feet. A couple of classical cases are also revisited, including the alien attack on Sutton's farm in Kelly and Mothman of Point Pleasant.Are we really supposed to believe in these yarns? Perhaps not. However, the complete lack of any sceptic versus true believer confrontation actually makes them strangely relaxing to watch... Four stars for what might become a piece of modern Americana.",1376265600,2013-08-12

2.0,"Don't be fooled by the hype in the trailer preview it looked great so I rented it thinking oh boy this is going to be a great film. Couple buys a house in a nice neighborhood, first day there nice but weird neighborhood guy keeps poping up climbing in the window etc, he is funny though, The husband seems oblivious to reality at times. The wife is pregnant, weird creepy things start happening it becomes scary. 2 Priests come to do an exorcism, she goes into labor has the baby but in reality there were 2 fetuses 1 a horrifying devil with horns etc, the other human Why I say moronic is when the baby devil bites the guys neck though having time to he doesn't do anything right away when a normal person given the chance would grab it by the throat trying to hold it away from them plus the priest could get it with the holy water etc I would. People are made to look stupid in parts of this movie which to me detracts from what could have been an awesome movie if the idiotic stuff had been cut out.I must admit some of it was comical from the stupidity. The actors are great liked them",1379980800,2013-09-24

5.0,"This show is about a large close-knit extended family constantly spending time together and dealing with the crisis's of everyday life, and absolutely NOBODY can keep a secret.  They mostly seem to be in hectic stress mode and the show is highly emotional.  BUT you like these characters and invest in them quickly and are thus willing and eager to share their joy and pain and all the garbage that is part of life.  There are also some good examples of a good marriage in this show - which is GREAT as so few of us get good role models there in real life.Craig T. Nelson is the father of 2 sons and 2 daughters, and he and his wife are hiding marital problems from their kids. The eldest son has a wife, a teenage daughter and a young son with Asperger syndrome (sort of a high functioning autism) and is highly depended upon by everyone to be ""the fixer"" in every situation, the other son is single and something of a commitment phobe who just discovered he has a 5-yr old son he never knew about (who by the way is a really adorable kid), Lauren Graham plays the older daughter who at age 38 returns home to live with her parents and start life over after having divorced her musician/junkie husband - with 2 semi-delinquent teenage kids in tow (a son and a daughter), and the other daughter is a lawyer trying to squeeze in some ""mom"" time with her daughter and her husband is the perfect handsome who gave up contracting/construction work to be a perfect stay-at-home dad to their little girl.The whole cast is fantastic and the show absolutely holds your attention. (And I am thankful to have another series to watch the incredible Lauren Graham in!)I didn't get to see this show on TV, so I was thrilled to be able to watch it on Amazon Prime (pretty much back to back and minus commercials!)  This show is a great dramatic series!",1348531200,2012-09-25

4.0,"NO SPOILERS:The highest rated TV program in 2013 (with a score of 92) according to Metacritics was the French series ""Les Revenants"" (""The Returned"").  ""Resurrection"" is the latest USA TV offering that is hoping to capitalize on the success of its foreign doppelganger (I.E. ""The Bridge"").First and foremost, props for not simply providing an English translation of the French script.  While the premise is the same, there are some differences in the set up.As perhaps one can surmise by the title, ""Resurrection"" is about people who have died, returning to the Missouri town from where they are from and at the same stage of physical development as when they died.  The show kicks off with 9-year old Jacob waking up in a rice paddy in China, 32-years after he apparently drowned in a river adjacent to his home in Missouri.At the end of the first episode there was another resurrection and in coming weeks there will be more.While the first episode of the French series was superior and offered greater shock value, ""Resurrection"" had a good opening episode.  On a personal level, it is quite the achievement to get my 11-year old to avert her eyes from her smart phone!",1394755200,2014-03-14
2.0,"This is definitely a weak series. It's an interesting premise but I just found so much of it cliched and PC'd out it's hard to swallow. First of all the very silly idea that some ex-rebel soldier would chase various people, even be able to do that much after a chaotic war, in order to get revenge for his wifes death-GAG. The main character has such wooden acting it's hard to care much about anything he does, even cold blooded murder in revenge. Some ex-slave owner part of the despotic South is hard to have much sympathy for. Oh and he's a saint too he just pays the ladies of the evening for services not rendered because of his noble nature-GAG. This is all just blather.This IS a ripoff of Deadwood down to the 2 friends looking to make an enterprise in a dangerous place, the Irish film projectionists(see Deadwood if you don't know who I'm comparing them to). I could care less about them too. Ugh the PC cliches just abound here. Everyone's represented, the blacks, the Indians, the British heroin, the evil bossman and yes the wronged rebel so sad-GAG. Everyone gets their small piece of heaven in each episode here so we can all get our pre-ordained PC helping.For anyone used to watching the HBO/Showtime stuff this is just too weak and shallow. Now I'm sure all you people who bought this will disagree, of course if you bought it you disagree! Ever notice how that works? It's hard to be critical of your own choices or yourself isn't it?This review is not for those who have bought this(or are paid to give good reviews) it's for those looking for an honest opinion of this series who are thinking of watching it or buying it.",1338422400,2012-05-31

5.0,ABC and Marvel have developed a strong show capable of both standing on its own and complementing Marvel movies. Each episode has developed the characters and it is obvious the actors actually have a passion for the material.  Clark Gregg and Ming-na Wen are consistently great. You also don't need to be into superheroes to enjoy the show. It is a strong and well done action-spy drama that brings cinematic quality to the small screen and gets better each episode.,1397520000,2014-04-15

It has a good plot, but often I wish it was even better, because it feels, maybe because of the set, maybe because of something else, that it lacks something. it feels sometimes not thrilling enough.

5.0,"My wife & I remember this series when it was on TV, but we did not pay it much attention. The teen-love-triangle-high-school-drama had been playing itself too much. However, recently, while being on bed rest for a few weeks & coincidentally seeing the new movie previews; I was intrigued by the hype. Then I decided to give it a try. (We are Amazon Prime Members & I saw it each time I logged in to watch a streaming show) It was better than we expected! It genuinely delivered - Veronica (Kristen Bell) sublimating her grief & pain into finding her best friends murderer, while helping her dad & fellow high school students with individualized cases - after they had all abandoned her due to the events of her father, then the sherif of Neptune, suffering at the hands of the wealthy, powerful parents. The stories, the filming, the writing was very good! We were completely addicted to the show and watched it until it came to the final episode. Yes, it had it's cheese & some Episodes did not quite hold true; it was still a very good series, launched many young Hollywood actors & actresses as well as showing up some faces of previous young Hollywood actors/actresses now playing adult parents to this generation. We will be seeing the movie this weekend-now that I'm off bed rest! (Can one be a Marshmellow in post-haste?)",1395446400,2014-03-22
3.0,"The subject matter of this episode is very familiar, I've seen it fictionalized before and even read news stories that were similar. Therefore, in order to make its mark, Elementary has to do it one step better than the previous shows. It has not.Past: A boy leaves his home and is abducted off the street. Balloons are left as a thank you for his parents by the kidnapper. Through the years more children are kidnapped. Some are found dead. Others aren't found at all.Today: A seventh child is abducted from her home. Her parents are abrasive, not sympathetic. Her father left her alone in the house to meet a former lover, and lies about it until Holmes confronts him. The woman he met was a witness to the kidnapping, she saw the escape vehicle. (At a later point the parents even suggest trading the first victim back to the kidnapper to secure the release of their daughter. When their demand is not agreed to, they then threaten to hold the captain responsible for all consequences).Watson manages to be more abrasive/intrusive than Holmes himself. The constant sniping and need to have the last word is irritating. Elementary is not improved by this Watson. Unless you appreciate that Holmes finds clues while he is trying to run away from her.The young man who was the first victim many years ago, is discovered driving the kidnapper's van and taken into custody while trying to flee. He refuses to help the police find the kidnapper. He has become attached to the man. This process is carefully explained to us.Holmes shares some of his own ""history"" with the rescued youth during an interview. Interesting tidbit if it is true (Holmes is evasive on the point later). He goes through his lightning quick analysis in a few locations. Very clever. He consistently maintains his emotional distance or does he show actual empathy? He discovers the little clues that others miss. His energy is toned down in this episode. Perhaps he finds listening to Watson as tiring as I do. Whatever the cause, he is less the scene stealer here. Still watchable, tho.The police are a touch too oblivious. They dash into the kidnapper's home, right past balloons in an empty room, then state they have nothing. Until Holmes tells them to go back. They find the incredibly obvious balloons and an attached USB drive. Too much Keystone Cops to be credible.Victim #1 is talked into signing an immunity agreement. In an act of atonement he reveals the kidnapper's new residence. The police bust in and rescue the little girl. The kidnapper commits suicide. The child is unharmed. Uhhhh, really?The psychology is interesting, make no mistake. But there are too many detractions to make this an improvement over the previous episodes of Elementary. Holmes finding a loophole in the immunity agreement is too predictable, not fresh at all. His pitting his wits against the clever young murderer who was Victim #1 is sort of bland.Sure they get their guy in the end, outwitting him. It just didn't quite meet its full potential. 2.75 stars rounded up to 3. Mea Culpa, I watched it twice.(If you are going to watch this more than once, as I did, not having to sit through the repetitive commercials is a great motivator to buy the episode at Amazon.)",1350691200,2012-10-20
1.0,"How can they rename a movie and then say it is being released before in theaters!  That is really a rip off.  That is so insulting, this movie was made in 2009 and is not being released in theaters. We are being played for money!  They should be more honest with us the renters and viewers. I am seriouisly offended, because I have spent a lot of money on Amazon rentals and purchases and trusted them.",1362700800,2013-03-08
5.0,"If you like original horror that has a vicious streak, then you're going to love V/H/S/2!  I wasn't sure what to expect before I watched this film; a couple of friends had seen it and told me it was really good.  But they never got into specifics, saying it was something you had to see to appreciate.  And man, I'm glad I did!  V/H/S/2 is a hell of a film, and I'm glad I gave it a shot!You can't think of this as a traditional horror film.  This is actually something new.  It is a compilation of short films, all shot from a first-person perspective, that all blend in with the main storyline.  But the shorts are not related.  In fact, it is the diversity of the shorts that make this film so enthralling.As I mentioned, each short film in V/H/S/2 is shot from the first-person perspective, so in a sense these are found-footage styled pieces.  But they are so much more as well.  Each film has its own style and voice, which allows you to switch gears when each film ends; this is not a negative, but in fact a good thing.  The different tones set a unique mood for each film...and as a result, the audience is taken on a roller-coaster ride of terror and fun.For example, one of the segments is called ""A Ride in the Park"".  In this piece, a mountain-biker mounts a GoPro camera on his helmet and sets off for a ride on a trail.  But things quickly go downhill when he stumbles across a group of shambling zombies.  I will not disclose the rest of the short, but it is excellent and one of my favorites.I particularly like how all the short films are secondary to the main plot-line.  However, if I were forced to find a fault with V/H/S/2, it would have to be that not much is explained in regard to the primary story.  It is tense and suspenseful, but I didn't know much about what was going on throughout it.  Perhaps this because I have yet to watch the first V/H/S...if so, I will have to remedy that very soon.V/H/S/2 is a definite win for me, however, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  There is some truly terrifying stuff in this film, so be ready.  But I can definitely see myself watching this one through a couple more times, just to see what I missed the first time around.  Give this one a look, if you can.",1383004800,2013-10-29
5.0,These last eight episodes were so engrossing that I wanted to own them and did.  Wasn't able to catch up with the whole showon Netflix but can go back sometime now that it is over.  I wanted to be part of the last episodes viewing public and be ableto discuss with my kids who told me I had to watch this (for years actually)because it was the best thing they'd ever seen.Read everything online after each episode and now look forward to seeing what everyone thought of this finale.I thought it was heartbreaking.

5.0,"For the first two seasons of &#34;Falling Skies&#34;, the show was a brilliant mix of plot, characters, action/adventure, and human emotion as the human survivors battled their alien oppressors.  That same sort of mix continues into this Third Season...but with an entirely new wrinkle added in!For a basic plot summary (some spoilers), this Third Season begins with explaining just what the heck happened in the Season Two finale!  Basically, Tom Mason (Noah Wyle) and Colonel Weaver (Will Patton) learn that their alien oppressors (now correctly identified as the Espheni) are not the only higher power in the galaxy.  A new alien race, the Volm, has been pursuing the Espheni across the galaxy trying to liberate planets.  The 2nd Mass. and the Volm quickly form an alliance to fight the Espheni...but can one alien species be trusted over another?Hal Mason (Drew Roy) and Margaret (Sarah Carter) play a large role in this season as well, what with Hal beginning to act stranger and stranger as the days go by.  Could Espheni-controlled Karen (Jessy Schram) be involved?  Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) gives birth to the newest Mason family member, which is a big change for everyone involved...including the child itself.  Of course, John Pope (Colin Cunningham) is always lurking around, stirring up dissent.Basically, &#34;Falling Skies&#34; does what it has always done this season...makes us cry, cheer, laugh, and (most importantly) CARE every single episode.  Even though the season is &#34;only&#34; ten episodes long, it feels like a real journey, as no moment is wasted.  The production/writing crew do a remarkable job of keep plots/visuals fresh, and the characters have now taken on a life of their own.In short, nothing to dissuade fans of the show here.  The show was a five-star effort from practically the moment it aired, and it remains so through three seasons!",1405728000,2014-07-19

5.0,"Longmire - Season 2 - [556 - 2014-01-31]Summary:Sheriff Walt Longmire and his three deputies are the face of law enforcement in Absaroka County, Wyoming.  As these police procedural dramas unfold two issues percolate in the background: conflicts with the overlapping jurisdiction of a local Indian reservation and a long simmering investigation into the murder of Sheriff Longmire's wife in Denver.Content:The Season 2 package consists of 3 disks and 13 episodes originally shown on the A&E; network May to August 2013.Positive Comments: Season 2 is, in my opinion, much better than season 1. The episodes each provide viewer insights into the main characters backgrounds and motivations; this was not apparent to me in season 1. Lots of narrative clues concerning the characters are touched upon making this viewer look forward to season 3.The Cast:This series pivots around Robert Taylor's towering performance as sheriff Walt Longmire. In my estimation he deserves accolades from his peers for his performance in this series. His loyal Indian friend Lou Diamond Phillips is excellent in this role. The three deputies each have a story arc and are competently played by the actors.Negative Comments: No deleted or extended scenes. Sometimes these are almost as enjoyable as the episode - and I'm next too positive they exist - but not even one was included in the season 2 boxed set! I would of like to have seen a feature included on Craig Johnson the author whose books inspired this series.Recommendations:This is a fascinating show with an excellent cast of well-developed characters. I was never bored and except for a few random occasions felt that the narrative was logical and reasonably believable. In case you're curious there is hardly any sex, some mild profanity but lots of violence as expected in a show of this nature.",1405296000,2014-07-14
2.0,"Margot (Michelle Williams)meets Daniel (Luke Kirby)and the two feel an intense and immediate attraction. But Margot is married to Lou (Seth Rogen), a cookbook writer and tries halfheartedly to resist. Margot seems bored by her domestic happiness with Lou. She craves excitement. As luck would have it, Daniel and Margot live across the street from one another. After over an hour of teasing, including a blow by blow verbal account of what Daniel would like to do to Margot, they succumb. Margot moves in with Daniel and they have hot and heavy sex including threesomes of various kind. But by the end of the movie, Margot is just as bored with Daniel as she had been with Lou.It sounds like the makings of a pretty good movie but this is so exploitative and unpleasant that watching it just becomes a tiresome chore. One scene in which we see a bunch of naked women in a swimming pool shower had me particularly puzzled. As well as the lovely bodies of Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman, we see a bunch of older bodies, sagging breasts, pendulous breasts, flabby tummies, wrinkled backsides. What is this for? Is it to remind us that youth is fleeting and age will catch up with us all? Do we need reminding? It seemed just gratuitous and almost cruel to me.The fleeting glimpses of Margot and Daniel in three-way sex were also like peepshow parades. Who does that kind of stuff? These seemed like two nice normal people. The filmmakers had a message and by golly they were going to get it through.For the first hour of this movie, there was a kind of slow-burn eroticism. By the end, just a nasty taste in the mouth.",1359849600,2013-02-03

5.0,"""Eddie doesn't rob banks...He's about this high in the bunch but he gets around more than any man I've ever seen,"" says Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), a baby-faced Boston cop about as amoral as the wiseguys he hunts. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a worn out, two-bit gunrunner. He provides untraceable revolvers when required. He draws the line at machine guns. Eddie is honorable in his way. He loves his family. He's just a low life who isn't all that shrewd. The fix he's in, because he can't take any more jail time, is what this superb Peter Yates' movie is all about.""Look. I'm gettin' old, y'hear?"" Eddie tells a young hood who deals in machine guns. ""I spend most of my life hangin' around crummy joints with the punks drinkin' the beer, eatin' the hash an' hot dogs and watchin' the other people go off to Florida while I'm sweatin' how I'm goin' to pay the plumber. I done time when I stood up but I can't take no more chances. Next time it's goin' to be me goin' to Florida."" Now he's facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions. He'll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time. He's nearly 50. He doesn't want his wife to go on welfare, doesn't want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time. He's squeezed by Dave Foley to inform...and Eddie decides he'll rat a little. He's too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time. It's all betrayal, but Eddie doesn't really understand betrayal. All those friends of Eddie's make us wary every time we meet them: Scalise (Alex Rocco), who robs banks, sometimes violently; Jackie (Steve Keats), the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns; Dillon (Peter Boyle), owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather. It's the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We're into Eddie's life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth's and Barbo's Furniture Store. It's a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. ""Have a nice day.""Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie's life. We're never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle's sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum's best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He's been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn't ask very many questions. He's just not smart enough. Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids, and who doesn't understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine. There is a commentary by Peter Yates.",1255824000,2009-10-18

A lot of hot, hot actors and actresses are in it, but there is really nothing that would raise an eyebrow when it comes to the mild scenes of nudity, however, when it comes to the violence and gore, there is enough to make everyone think back to Ernest Borgnines harrowing death scene in the wolf pit in the Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh and Kirk Douglas starrer &#34;The Vikings&#34;.  I still love that movie, especially when Tony Curtis and Janet are escaping from the villains in a small row boat and he tears her bodice because it's to tight for rowing.  That's the hint of nudity that raised eyebrows in the 50's.  Tasteful.  That's how they handle it in this series.  Tastefully.

2.0,"It still amazes me how little people prepare themselves for making what is probably the biggest investment in their lifetime. They worry about little things like the color of paint, or cleaning the carpet. One couple liked the look of ivy climbing up a cinder block wall which faced their back yard. It didn't bother them that the wall was part of the industrial building next door. They didn't stop to realize that the price of the house, which was lower than typical for that street, had a reason. The higher priced houses were farther down the street from the factory, Other people liked the furnishings, or other items in a house, which normally do not go with the sale of the house unless those items are in a separate personal property sale agreement. Finally, I don't know many people who purchase a house after looking at only three houses.  This program has too much repeating of names, locations, and other facts, and in general is a poorly made time filler.  When I was a sales person, if I made as many errors in a sales presentation as most of the agents in this program do I would have starved and quickly gone out of business.  Buyers don't care what a sales person likes as the term, &#34;I like...&#34; is used over and over again during the sales presentations.

4.0,"This series gets a bit beyond lackluster stereotypes except for the therapy part where platitudes seem to be the cure for every ill.  Dani is an o.k. therapist, I guess, but most deluded when it comes to her own relationships.  Matt is a trip down memory lane hoping and praying for a do-over of her past.  Nico represents the future and, I wish, a much better prospect for a mature and grown-up Dani looking ahead.  These two very different men are the subtext to the overall theme of a therapist with high-powered clients who play games for a living.  Dani, though diminutive in size, can stand up to the toughest client both emotionally and physically.  There is enough of a story line where another season would be appreciated.  However, the ""getting real"" is as much of an issue for the writers of this series as it is for their characters, Dani especially.",1362614400,2013-03-07

4.0,"The premise: a non-governmental exploration of Jupiter's Ice Moon - Europa, hense then name of the ship and mision.Created in the fashion of multiple scenes at the same time (which always underminds movies that have theatrical release due to the ""break in the story"") actually works because of the ""presentation"".The Sci-Fi element is minimal due to the strong reflection of reality as experienced by astronauts in long duration space travel, yet everything tht brought tension was not some convienently contrived issue, but a consideration of what realy can happen.Is there a Fiction element to this movie -- yes, but I won't spoil it for you -- you just gotta watch the movie.Is this worth the watch? yes, especially if you have any interest in space related themes. It is better than most space themed movies that hollywood has put out without an actual historic event to ""dramaticly"" re-enact.Those who think it was a bad movie are used to the multi-million dollar films that hollywood puts out like harry potter and star wars where lights flash and the music thunders in the ears. The sound track in this movie helps to keep this from being the kind of boring nasa release, but is not the basis of the story (both harry potter and star wars would have flopped if they could not have had a music score to hold the story rolling on - in those movies it was the music that made them great (or good in the case of Harry Potter), in this one the story is facinating enough that once you start, you just want to see it through and then you realize that the music was there too. This is one movie that will be worth adding and keeping in the movie cd library.If there is a choice between promethius and this movie for which to watch or is better -- Europa Report wins!!!Ya gotta watch at least once. Just wait until the rental is below $3 cause no movie is worth renting for $10 -- I had thought I was buying it when I agreed to the price... oopppss on me.",1374883200,2013-07-27
5.0,"A growing trend in television is the difference in tone between network tv and cable programming. For the most part, network shows are scrubbed clean of any harsh, yet realistic, language, the characters are saccharine caricatures of the way people act, and you can see the &#34;plot twists&#34; coming a mile away. Cable programming, at times, goes to the opposite extreme. The series can be filled with unrealistic violence, sex, and language with characters so overly exaggerated it simply isn't realistic that they would exist, and the plot twists are equally obvious.That is what makes Bosch some impressive. It manages to find the elusive balance that only the very best show, Breaking Bad, Justified, ect, are able to reach. The beginning of the episode does a good job of putting us in Bosch's frame of mind, giving us valuable perspective for the trial scenes. Though I do wish his defense attorney had been a little more fleshed out, this episdoe had a lot of ground to cover so its natural that something would be left behind.The camera work and direction was impressive, though a few of the forest scenes weren't lit well enough. The characters are likeable and clearly have room to grow and evolve. The case that takes center stage is equal parts fascinating and horrific, making you need to know what happens next.Bosch is the type of show that needs to be seen. It is of the highest quality, and I for one, can't wait to see what comes next.",1391904000,2014-02-09

2.0,"I love sci-fi and really liked the X-files. It seemed the characters were fighting a bad script on this one .  So many plot holes and logical inconsistency.  Actually kind of frustrating to watch. It was like the old Three's Company episodes where everything could have been cleared up in the first scene if someone had just told the whole truth. I tend to like sci-fi movies and shows BECAUSE the protagonist is the smartest person in the room.  They would do what you would want them to do, because it makes sense.  So many things happened in this show that didn't make sense.  Not in a mysterious ""LOST: what is the black smoke?"" kind of way, but in a frustrating people acting completely stupid kind of way.Hopefully the pilot was just trying to jump start some good writers and character development.",1393459200,2014-02-27

It got so bad for me that I shut off the movie and 30 mins. I guess Ruairi Robinson is deaf and didn't notice how they were speaking.

2.0,"Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here, I don't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is. So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don't flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them. So, they in turn, gave up on the CW.All speculation aside, VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season. The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact, but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts. The ratings that they're suffering aren't because of quality of show, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we're watching... and unfortunately, we're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore.",1188172800,2007-08-27

5.0,"**SPOILER FREE**Very good show. I was hesitant to always watch this because I've found with some of the cable network created shows can be okay at first but get tired very quickly, thankfully this one is not. I was binge watching &#34;The Good Wife&#34; and got all caught up but was looking for another law show so gave this a shot, glad I did.This is a very funny, hip, edgy at times, new type of lawyer show.  Smooth talking lawyers, pain in the butt sneaky lawyers, they're all there. You'll get hooked quickly on this show and want to get to the next one.I'd compare it to a little of &#34;The Good Wife&#34; in a way without the political and marriage drama, another good example of a show I liked that was canceled too soon was &#34;Raising the Bar&#34; on TNT network.  Even I see a little of the old LA Law with the characters and the relationships in the office with the workers.Give this a chance and I think you'll really enjoy this show.",1404259200,2014-07-02
4.0,"------------------------------------------------""Roadie""(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2012)------------------------------------------------Ron Eldard shines as the lead in this indie film, playing Jimmy Testagros, a working-class lug from Queens, NY who is brought down to earth after having spent twenty-six years as a roadie for his all-time favorite rock band, and then getting fired and having to confront the emptiness of a life spent on the move. Down on his luck, he heads back to his hometown and the cold comfort of his rock-poster filled room in his widowed mother's house. Bobby Cannavale plays his dramatic foil, a former high school bully whose grown up into a jerky, loudmouthed adult who lures Jimmy back into the same humiliating, imbalanced power dynamic that divided them as teens. Cannavale's character generates heat in the script but is a little overstated -- his jerkiness is explained by his being a cokehead, but it's still a bit much. A more subtle performance comes from veteran character actor Lois Smith, who plays Jimmy's half-senile mother, and whose subtle reactions and keen appraisal of her son's failings gives the film real kick.  Eldard's Jimmy -- mopey, charming, transparent and forlorn -- is a compelling character, likable though pathetic, a guy who's bottoming out yet remains charismatic and attractive despite his all-too apparent failings. This is a movie about accepting people with all their flaws, which is a message I appreciate -- it might be a little too depressing or one-note for many viewers, but it's definitely worth checking out.

Everything turns to chaos when Gere&#8217;s character (under the influence of alcohol) flees the scene of an accident only for his lover to die in the car.  Everything then spirals out of control while he desperately attempts to cover the tragic events up.  I felt that this movie was well-acted, suspenseful, and very entertaining.

I didn't once feel: &#34;Okay, this is dragging.&#34;, no, it kept moving and kept drawing me in.  The humans involved are all very well fleshed out character wise, and they also make you care about them. They are real people reacting to a horrific situation.  The dialogue I thought was excellent, they spoke as we do, they reacted the way you or I would, and that just adds so much to the viewing experience for me.

I couldn't tell if it was him or one of his brothers.Anyway, yeah, I'd watch this again if it stays as funny as this pilot was.",1366761600,2013-04-24

5.0,"What a wonderful show.  These guys don't care about the cameras.  Unlike Yukon Men and Alaska the Last Frontier -- the characters of those two shows seem to show off to the cameras and glorify their chosen lifestyles.  In Mountain Men, it's REAL life for them.  Cameras or not.  This is what they do on a day-to-day; minute-to-minute basis.  Imagine having Eustace as your boss!  Oh my God, I would not.Ranking-wise, my favorite to least favorites are (although I like them all):1) Eustace.  The big man on the block.2) Marty.  A technician.3) Rich,  A master at animals.4) Tom.  The old geezer who won't stop.5) Charlie. The new guy on the block.6) George.  Just do it as you go George.Anything Eustace does, from getting in someone's face to building what seems to be a simple wagon, is always thrilling.  Just don't go work for him.  Very much looking forward to season 3.  Both season 1 and 2 are worth the price if you have to pay for them.  Remember! Amazon has no commercials and we all love that.  You will look forward to every episode.Note: Since I started watching Mountain Men, I stopped watching Yukon Men and Alaska the Last Frontier.",1384387200,2013-11-14
5.0,"I suddenly got addicted with this amazing series, so when I saw season 1, I thought it was perfection: it had a little bit of drama, horror and crazy twists. But now that I got to see season 2, I fell in love completely with this show! Season 2 (also known as ""Asylum"") delivers great storylines; there's always something happening with all the characters, amazing performances, and the factor that makes you want more when an episode ends! Also, there's more gore and insanity on this season, so if you can't stand blood or human organs, you may not enjoy this season as much as season 1, that was a little bit more psychological and less gory, but in my case, I don't mind.But the best part of this is the cast! I love the way they use most of the main actors on this show and they always find a perfect role for everyone, I think it shows their versatility; Jessica Lange (the best part of this show, she can play anything!), Lily Rabe (who thought that she could play a spiteful woman after playing the moaning Nora in season one?), Evan Peters (an actor with a great future waiting for him) and Sarah Paulson (who didn't had a really big role in season one, but she became my favorite character of this season, she's an amazing actress and you believe her acting when she cries, or when she's in pain), overall there's no bad actor in this show, everyone acts amazingly. You get to love characters when you're supposed to hate them (possessed Sister Mary Eunice, and Sister Jude), something that happens rarely, in my opinion, that's how awesome this show is.As I write this, I haven't finished season 2 (I have only seen 10 episodes of 13), but I can tell this is another great season for this show that is here to stay for a long time! ""American Horror Story"" is one of the best shows of this decade. I'm still watching Season 3 (Coven), which is being great too!",1382745600,2013-10-26

4.0,"The first thing you'll notice is that SGU is trying to capitalize on the success of BSG: the camera work is similar, the atmosphere equally grim, and the recipe laced with a dash of sex. Luckily they also copied BSG's inclusion of philosophical debates (whether spoken or inferred) and the grand social experiments that spring out of one of sci-fi's oldest scenarios: people being stuck in space with each other. You'll also notice that they are playing around with flashbacks; many shows do this, but i got a distinct impression early on that they were trying to mimic LOST. Sometimes it works, other times it's just distracting.Although ""military sci-fi"" is my least favorite subgenre of space shows, i have loyally watched every episode of Stargate since 1997. SGU breathes new life into the franchise - Atlantis was starting to get repetitive and i was basically only tuning in to experience the witty, whiny sarcasm of David Hewlett. SGU not only displays some talent in acting, but also a few new ideas in plot that were not explored in Stargate shows previously.SGU was struggling to find its footing in the first half of the season, and it suffered from some particularly boring plots, such as one horrible episode that was the equivalent of having a wasp stuck in your house and trying to chase it out a window. Yet my perseverance in watching has finally paid off in the 2nd half of the season. The story arc is finally developing nicely, including a new group of aliens who lack the cheese factor of SG-1's Goa'uld and so far have proven more mysterious than the Wraith.One thing that annoys the hell out of me is random inclusion of songs in the eps that i guess are supposed to be part of the narration or something but bomb the mood instead of affirming it. I mean the emo or whatever type of crap music they use is not as much of a disaster as if they woulda spliced a rap song into the footage, but they really screwed up bigtime by including music with lyrics. Obviously someone on the production team wanted to be trendy and/or include their favorite artists: this indulgence should not have been permitted.Anyway, the plot possibilities are almost limitless, and I think SGU has potential to pull off some great story arcs and keep the generally smart tone of the show without the trappings of its predecessors. Let's hope they keep moving in the direction that the 2nd half of s01 turned towards.",1272758400,2010-05-02

We who grew up knowing that MAD was  a real possibility, can appreciate this point of view from the Soviet perspective.The actors and actresses just act and get out of the way of a great story.  The musical score adds just the right tone and is not over-dramatic.  Hearing a Russian score again is a pleasure.  So to the writers and to Fox I say, please do not ruin a great show. Follow the precedent of ""Boardwalk Emprire"" and give us thoughtful stories and hard action like the fight in episode two.  Please treat us like intelligent viewers, and I will put my money where my mouth is.  If I had a nuke I would probably drop it on the set of ""24"" or ""Greys Anatomy.""

5.0,"This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure. Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",1295049600,2011-01-15

After watching last weeks episode, where Carter was shot down, I waited with baited breath to see how The Devil's Share episode was going to be presented.

4.0,"With all the success that AMC has had recently turning out high quality adult programs such as ""Mad Men"" and ""The Walking Dead,"" few new dramas in 2011 were as eagerly anticipated as their Western revival ""Hell on Wheels."" Despite a somewhat mixed reaction from the mainstream media, the show was an instant hit when its premiere episode became the network's second highest rated debut in history. And yet, despite these big numbers and impeccable production values, it is still very much a show that is finding its way creatively and dramatically. There are so many reasons to recommend ""Hell on Wheels"" and yet it takes a while to find its footing after a powerhouse beginning. For most of its ten episodes, I found myself admiring the show's technical construction as opposed to loving its storytelling arc.The two strongest components of the show (evident from the very beginning) were its lavish depiction of the Old West with some spectacular battles and effects and a dynamic lead villain in Colm Meaney. The story opens in a post-Civil War America with an enigmatic soldier (Anson Mount) seeking revenge for the murder of his wife by Union officers. His journey puts him in the heart of a railroad construction project led by Meaney at an untamed post on the outskirts of civilization. There are working girls, disgraced clergy, thuggish bosses, newly emancipated slaves, a Native American presence and a myriad of other unscrupulous business types coexisting in this tempestuous microcosm and seeking to exploit the new possibilities on the road west. Meaney is absolutely terrific and other notable performances are turned in by Common (unexpectedly solid as a sometimes ally of Mount) and Tom Noonan (as a preacher trying to reform his life). While the entire cast is quite good, some of the peripheral characters have yet to be developed in any meaningful way.There is no denying that ""Hell on Wheels"" is a handsome and extremely well executed from a technical standpoint. From the sets to the costumes to the effects, there are some pretty spectacular action set pieces and period recreations. It's obvious that many people love ""Hell on Wheels."" I wished I had been more emotionally connected to the earlier episodes, it took about half of the season before I felt really invested. After that, though, I really loved much of what came next. There are so many strong elements at work here--I was willing to be patient. The skeleton for a improved second season is in place. As long as the show digs deeper into its characterizations, there's no reason to think it can't develop into one of TV's best dramas.

5.0,"In an effort to capitalize on the audience from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" the FX network has tried a number of promising shows. ""Sunny,"" to me, has always been a completely inspired bit of lunacy that defies everything about the age of political correctness in which we find ourselves. It is so wrong--but that's what makes it so right. Unapologetically demented and offensive, the show has moments of brilliance. ""Archer,"" of all the programs that have followed the ""Sunny"" time slot comes the closest to the ribald and irreverent tone and works exceedingly well as a companion piece.""Archer"" is a terrifically entertaining animated piece featuring perhaps the most obnoxious and oblivious central characters you're likely to encounter. Sterling Archer (aka Duchess) is a spy who fulfills every sexist cliche one might expect from a boozy, clueless, womanizing James Bond wannabe! In other words, he is awesome! Voiced impeccably by H. Jon Benjamin, it is sheer madness to follow Archer as he blunders his way through assignments, familial entanglements, and romantic assignations. His flirtations with fellow spy Lana (Aisha Tyler), his rivalry with Lana's new beau Cyril (Chris Parnell), his workplace banter with easy Cheryl and inappropriate Pam (Judy Greer and Amber Nash), and his wonderfully dysfunctional mother love (the incredible Jessica Walter) are juggled nicely amidst a bevy of ""Get Smart"" missions. It's all great, but patently disturbing, fun.Season One represents 10 episodes. Two standouts to me are ""Mole Hunt""--the first episode, and perhaps the funniest, that strikes the perfect balance of wackiness and character introduction--and ""Honeypot"" where Archer must put his life and his body on the line as an irresistible gay boy toy. By all means, check this series out if you like comedy that straddles the line of good taste and then jumps over it! I loved this creation named Archer and his relationship with his mother is one of this great show's true highlights. Benjamin and Walter are a perfect pair! About 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 11/10.",1310256000,2011-07-10
4.0,I have long been a fan of British police dramas as well as the dry English wit (notwithstanding Monty Python & company).  The set period lends itself well to demonstrating the less than enthusiastic welcome to women in a male dominated profession.  Excellent acting by all.,1402617600,2014-06-13

5.0,"I love Sons of Anarchy, but some seasons more than others. But season 6 is one of my favorites. It's hard to go into details without major spoilers, but season 6 was very dark with a high body count. Excellent storyline, good acting and one of the best soundtracks on TV, all add up to must see season.FX is giving AMC some tough competition in the basic cable original series category.",1388793600,2014-01-04
5.0,I can see myself tiring of this show but my 5 yr old likes it so my rating is reflecting his thought's and comments as it is directed at his age group. I like that the show is nonviolent and puts positive values on a younger group unlike most shows. The adventure aspect is reminiscent of shows like Dora the Explorer and I genuinely think that the younger children will absolutely love this show.,1369008000,2013-05-20

4.0,"Copper is a period drama, set in New York of the 1860's featuring an Irish-American detective and Civil-War veteran Kevin Corcoran who's tasked with fighting crime in an increasingly lawless environment, simultaneously resisting wide-spread corruption in his own profession all the while attempting to unravel the mystery of his missing wife and murdered daughter.I'm not usually into dark-underside-of-society thematically but Copper looks like such a well-crafted production (sort of ""Tombstone"" meets ""Gangs of New York"") featuring: an outstanding cast of international actors, a visually distinctive use of color & light, costumes & sets lending a feel of authenticity and a pretty solid script that I found to be very engaging.  Individual performances overall are actually exceptional for a television series and it was definitely the characters rather than the story that kept me coming back.Although the series can be violent at times it is relatively tastefully done and the language doesn't follow the lowest denominator ad absurdum formula like your typical HBO/Showtime series, however I think they could cut out about half of the graphic romance and still maintain the overall feel of mature drama as it frequently threatens to overwhelm the plot.  Additionally, the child Annie, although whose tragic experiences blends well with the overall theme of social degradation just makes me wonder about what sort of precedent maintaining a child as a recurring character in a very mature role may set for future television.Overall, I would definitely recommend giving this series a chance particularly when contrasted with a similar show such as AMC's shallow-to-the-point-of-cartoonish Hell on Wheels, as Copper doesn't seem to feel the obligation to insert anachronistic, PC clich&eacute;s in an attempt to soft-soap a turbulent time in U.S. history.  :o)",1368403200,2013-05-13
4.0,"&#34;Intelligence&#34; is &#34;Chuck&#34;'s serious older brother. Interesting tech, good action and fight sequences, and Josh Holloway often takes his shirt off.

4.0,"""Answer Man"" (2008) charmingly and shockingly knocks off the 1997 hit, ""As Good As It Gets"", only Answer Man didn't get any Academy Awards.  Both films feature a quirky, rude, obsessive and reclusive author who hopes for rescue from his pathetic life upon encountering a vulnerable and resilient single mom. The snappy dialogue flows.  Answer Man also lifted the sad, fatherless child, the needy single neighbor who craves emotional and financial support from the recluse, and the long-suffering, devoted agent/assistant . ""Answer Man"" did drop the adorable dog (Verdell in AGAIT) who provided such an ""awww"" factor , and substitutes a puppy-like young friend to prop up the single mom instead of a supportive grandma. The other superficial details don't even matter.  In the end, Jeff Daniels in ""Answer"" and Jack Nicholson in ""As Good"" win the moms(Helen Hunt in AGAIT and Lauren Graham in AM) by protecting their sons, and making BIG gestures to become better men themselves.  I adored AGAIG, and I was perfectly well-entertained by this copycat although amazed that the producers would so boldly rip off such a famous and fabulous original.  In both films, all the actors do their thing excellently, though Nicholson wins the award for making his recluse edgy enough to make you cringe, right up to the moment where he redeems himself with soul-baring honesty.",1327622400,2012-01-27

I know for a fact that the sun shines and we turn on lights in our homes and offices, the street lights work just fine. Why does the director think we all live in the dark? We have no dark and spooky forests down in Southern Calif....those are in Northern California.  Takes a lot away from the story when I cannot see the action.

4.0,"Fox Network and TV and Movie's latest incarnation of the Washington Irving fable.  Interestingly, there has been no mention of Mr. Irving's work throughout the series thus far.  Even the main character is no surprise to scene and though it hasn't been mentioned, I have begun to wonder if this all takes place in an alternate reality/universe where no one goes to see Johnny Depp movies or reads Washington Irving.  All that being said, I like the actors, Tom Bilson as Icabod Crane and Nicole Beharie as Lt. Abbie Mills one of modern day Sleepy Hollow's finest who is caught up in the mayhem.  The chemistry is there between the actors and provides a pathway for development of the storyline in any direction the creators want to take.  Orlando Jones is also a mainstay as Abbie's new captain, having replaced her beheaded ex-boss played by the always welcome Clancy Brown who pops up from time to time.  The series has a dark look to it that you would expect from a show that gives you a red eyed white horse and a headless horseman.  Filmed in and around Wilmington and New Bern North Carolina, what can I say, it works . . . and it works well.  I recommend it whole heartedly.",1388534400,2014-01-01

I watched all the previous episodes on demand today.It was amazing rideAndre Braugher is amazing  as Marcus Chaplin, the captain of the nuclear submarine Colorado. He and his second in command Sam Kendal (Scott Speedman)  are told to do a nuclear strike from an unsecured line. When asking for repeat conformation, his sub is fired on by another US submarine. It has overtones of Fail Safe with all the political intrigue. The tensions is high & powerful. It does not let up until the final episode...and still there is air of mystery at the end. You wonder who is a friend and who is a traitor, both in the crew of the Colorado and in Washington DC.The supporting cast including Daisy Betts, Robert Patrick, Jessy Schram and Sahr Ngaujah who adds to this piece so well. It is not a star vehicle for any actor. It is a character study drawn over 13 episodes. There are no weak performancesIn a way, I am glad this show lasted only 13 episodes, it was complete. Loose ends were tightly tighten and it works. I do not think this show should have gone further than this 13 episode arc...it began and ended!

4.0,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEWTodd (Greg Kinnear) is a preacher who works one day a week, is given a home and has trouble with bills in a small Nebraska town. After letting his son have a high fever for four days, he takes him to the hospital where the son Colton, (Connor Corum) becomes delusional, sees Jesus and imagines he can act. After being read a story about animals, he claims Jesus had a rainbow colored horse. After a funeral of an old veteran, Colton claims he saw Todd's grandfather. Todd shows him a picture of his grandfather and almost as if prompted, says, yup that is him. The child also knew that mom had a miscarriage and lost a baby, something I knew as a child growing up. i.e. it is not that remarkable that he knew about it. Seems the kid added to the story as things went along.The story allows believers and skeptics to take away what they want from the tale. For Christians it is a feel good story affirmation that their blue-green eyed Jesus with a neatly trimmed beard and curly locks is real. The film supplies enough information for the skeptic as Todd seeks out help and is told, &#34;There are many explanations.&#34;This is a far better film than &#34;God's Not Dead&#34; and more inspirational.3 1/2 stars",1399766400,2014-05-11

5.0,"Little Bill is a wonderful show for learning about life, in general, from a young child's perspective.  Having a 3-generational family makes the show very interesting, but the bigger attraction is that the show addresses a 'cross-section' of the U.S./or the world.  The children and families are of varying ethnic backgrounds...something most U.S. based shows lack altogether.  It is culturally sensitive and doesn't dwell upon children who have an 'abundance.'  It is creative, easy to understand and fun.  And absolutely no violence...quite true to Bill Cosby style.  I would recommend this to any child of any background anwhere!  I wish Amazon would offer the entire series, it would be a great thing option for families such as mine that are in search of these kinds of shows for our little ones.",1391299200,2014-02-02

Breaking Bad has mesmerized audiences by giving us a glimpse of what a man is willing to do when he feels he has little left to lose in life. Taking the final steps in the right direction, the producers of this show have hit the ""nail on the head"" with the theme of ""The Transformation Of Walt To Heisenberg.""

Season five is a big change from the previous seasons, but it's proving to be increasingly alluring with each new episode.  I suspect that the creators of the show got a little bored with ISIS missions and I'm really glad they were inspired to go in a new direction.No spoilers, just a five star recommendation from me for a witty animated adult comedy action TV series; and like all good television it's even better when streamed uninterrupted from the internet.I don't know why people are so upset about the short little FX adds in the first couple of episodes, you don't have to watch the adds if you don't want to.Edited: Season 5, not season 3.",1391040000,2014-01-30

4.0,"The title just says it all doesn't it?  Zombie Strippers tells you by title alone whether or not this is your kind of flick or not, and if it is, you should be pretty well satisfied with what you get here.  In the not too distant future, the government has outlawed public nudity and is experimenting with re-animating dead flesh.  Hence the title, when a zombie outbreak begins at a secret, illegal strip club run by a germophobe (a gleeful Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund).  It isn't long before a number of the dancers not only start craving human flesh, but also become an even bigger draw, which you know of course inevitably leads to a nasty, gorey massacre.  With tongue firmly in cheek and even featuring some decent political gags, Zombie Strippers features some great practical gore effects (and some cruddy CGI effects), and also features adult entertainment icon Jenna Jameson, who actually seems to be having some fun with it all.  All in all, Zombie Strippers by all rights and purposes should be a terrible, terrible flick, but it ends up being an enjoyable romp that is more than worth checking out if zombies, B-movies, or just plain trash is your pleasure.",1225756800,2008-11-04

Even if he didn't want to show that on TV, I'd hope he filmed it to include in a non-TV version of the show; I'd like to see how it's done.  I really enjoy the harmonica playing and all the survival tips, like how to make fire by rubbing 2 sticks together, and how to prepare grasshoppers to eat.  In this series there is no ""fourth wall""; i.e. Les is constantly talking with the audience.  Besides that, there is no attempt to hide the cameras.  This series is about survival, but it's also about filming a show about survival.  Les doesn't just have to show how he climbed up a hill, he has to set up the camera, climb the hill, then walk back down and get the camera!  Plus, he has 50 pounds of camera stuff to haul around.  Les seems like a pretty smart guy, and I'll bet he has enough footage to make a whole show without talking to the audience or showing the cameras.  He really is a good camera man and has some great footage of wild scenery.

I look forward to watching Mozart in the Jungle.,1392854400,2014-02-20
3.0,"Perhaps Chris Carter is channeling the existential theme of Sartre's No Exit. We are presented with an unlikeable cast of 8 miscreants forced to endure each other in a battle set in an apocalyptic event, but I am not sure how much of this I or other viewers  will be able to endure, especially if the actress wannabee with the French accent doesn't tone it down a bit.  Keeps your attention but I found myself uncomfortable being in the same room with the TV, which may exactly be the hellish effect Carter was going for.",1391644800,2014-02-06
5.0,"This is a great opening. Nonstop excitement. Definitely my new favorite. Of course it is only episode one, so I'll be watching more episodes and reviewing. So far I am wholeheartedly behind it. They've touched on just about all the questions left at the end of the last season. Darn. I wanted a two hour premiere.....Episode two. What can you say, complete ethical hairball. On one hand Nick was unwillingly drugged out of his mind, and magically turned into a killing machine. Was it his fault? Is he to blame for the actions he perpetrated after Samedi made him into a zombie? Or were Samedi and Eric Renard the true murderers? On the other hand, someone died, and it was Nick's body was the tool that caused the death. And that poor family, those kids. Awful. Does Nick's lack of consent, his being forcibly drugged eliminate his responsibility? Maybe. Two have been punished for their horrible misdeeds. Eric and the Baron. Is it enough? If Nick is held responsible for what he could not control, will justice be served?The group has made their choice. And I think it is pretty expected. They are now all bound by the decision, yet Nick is going to be tortured by it, it is only because he is a good man that he is so horribly torn and troubled. I do not see why Renard has kept the flash, best destroy it completely. And in Europe Adalind is messing with Sean's child, and also and accessory to murder as a much more aware participant... surely that can not be forgiven, is more heinous a crime. What is going to happen next? Certainly living up to the Horror show tag. Can't wait for more. The Renards... Nick.... Adalind.... Nick looking like a zombie again....where is that gonna go? Eek.",1382832000,2013-10-27
5.0,"After 11 years NCIS is still just as awesome as ever!! I hated losing Ziva and hope she will return someday in the near future but it is still the best series out there! I was a little disappointed with the new girl but she got more tolerable once they started treating her like a probie and put her in her place. Gibbs finally started letting her know he is the boss and Tony and McGee starting letting her know she was the newbie and didn't &#34;know it all&#34;. That's the way it was for everyone else and that is the way it should be for the new girl.

3.0,"The next stage of human evolution has begun. All over the world, individuals are developing the powers of telepathy, telekinesis and teleportation. A secret government-funded agency, Ultra, is tasked with keeping these individuals under control or removing their powers altogether. However, a small group of 'Tomorrow People' has taken refuge under the streets of New York and is preparing for the day when they can escape persecution.The Tomorrow People is an SF franchise with some history behind it. It originally aired from 1973 to 1979 as a zero-budget children's programme in the UK. Although almost forgotten today, it remains the second-longest-running British SF show of all time in terms of episode count (just beating out Red Dwarf). The series was then revived in 1992 for a three-season run. The premise of both shows was that humanity is developing into another form of life - homo superior - and that the new 'break-outs' (humans who have developed these powers) need to be helped by the existing Tomorrow People to deal with their newfound abilities. Both shows also used more overtly SF elements like aliens and robots, with the Tomorrow People using an alien spacecraft as their headquarters and relying on a powerful AI named TIM to help them.This latest reboot is from the American CW network and is surprisingly faithful to the original show. Character names are reused, original lead actor Nicholas Young has a cameo and even TIM (now a human-built computer) returns. However, the premise is complicated, darkened and made a bit less hokey. There are no aliens or spaceships and the struggle is now presented as being between the Tomorrow People and those humans aware of their existence and who see them as a threat, not a symbol of hope. There are also internal struggles within the Tomorrow People, between those who seek to use their powers for good, those who just want to get on with their lives and others who actively want to use their powers to commit crimes.Our main POV character is Stephen Jameson (Robbie Amell), who breaks out in the first episode and finds himself torn between joining Ultra (run by his uncle Jedikiah, played by genre-favourite Mark Pellegrino) and a group of rebels led by John (Luke Mitchell) and Cara (Peyton List). Relations are complicated by John and Cara's group having been founded years earlier by Stephen's missing father Roger (Jeffrey Pierce). Early episodes play up a cheesy love triangle between Stephen, John and Cara and rely on break-out-of-the-week plots in which Stephen, having joined Ultra to spy on it for the rebels, has to maintain his cover whilst also helping his friends. Some episodes show promise - Cara's back-story is surprisingly well-handled, with List playing the younger, more rebellious version of the character with more aplomb than the somewhat dull modern equivalent - but it's pretty disposable stuff.The show shifts up a gear in the mid-season, when more people find out about Stephen's powers and the real main antagonist, the Founder (played with scene-destroying relish by ex-Spartacus actor Simon Merrells) shows up to complicate things. The ongoing story arc comes more to the fore and for a few episodes the show almost lives up to its potential. Particularly welcome is Luke Mitchell stepping up to the plate and impressing more in the role of John. The showrunners seem to be aware of this, with a move in the mid-season away from focusing on Stephen as the protagonist (despite bringing enthusiasm to the role, Amell's range is rather limited) and instead on the group as a whole. This works well until the last couple of episodes when the plot starts lurching in all kinds of random directions and the conclusion to the season-long arc ends up being a bit of a damp squib. The cliffhanger pulls it back a little by providing some interesting groundwork for the next season, but given there isn't going to be one (the show was cancelled after filming concluded) that doesn't really help.The Tomorrow People (***) is watchable, cheesy and disposable fun which occasionally delivers some above-average performances and episodes. There's certainly a lot of mileage in the premise and it's a shame that the show won't be given a chance to improve with time and more episodes. However, the show is also predictable, frequently badly-written and some of the actors should really think about taking up other careers: Jeffrey Piece is particularly awful, over-acting to the hilt and making even his cornier young co-stars look amazing in comparison. Overall, the series is only worth a watch once you have exhausted the several dozen better series around at the moment.",1403395200,2014-06-22

1.0,"First of all - why? Second of all - if anyone likes Pretty Little Liars simple because its so cheesy and the girls dress well, then you will not be able to stomach Ravenswood.  PLL was great its first season, but then the plot lines just kept getting dopier and dopier and finally my friend and I just gave up.  Well, we both realized that sense we're adults, it was just hard to keep watching because it was getting so ridiculously stupid.  But then with the Halloween special I thought: Okay - maybe they will wrap up some of these plot lines that have gone nowhere for five seasons.  The Halloween show was their attempt to introduce Ravenswood.  Basically Hannah's boyfriend Caleb came to &#34;rescue&#34; her from Ravenswood and he meets some other chic on the bus who is all &#34;i'm cute and in distress,&#34; and then Hannah is like, &#34;Oh i love you Caleb, so please stay in Ravenswood and help this other girl.&#34; WTF????

I would like to watch a few more before making a final decision on this show because they end it with an upbeat, positive outlook that makes me wonder what else is in store.

4.0,"I seem to be in the minority, but for me season 3 represented a bit of frustrating fall off from the preceding years,although it still has it's share of strong moments, and the last 2 episodes are very powerful. But some of the earlier weaknesseshave gotten more prevalent; twists that seem a bit arbitrary, rules of its world that seem to shift to fit story convenience, storylines that get dropped, character choices and complex morality that aren't really explored or are over-simplified, episodes thatseem a bit disconnected from the others.And some of the strengths are less played too; fewer ironic or emotional uses of rock music, fewer visually inventive scenes,and most importantly, less genuine emotion, and more slightly histrionic soapy-ness. (Suddenly the characters seem tocry in every episode, which starts to make those powerful moments lose their impact). And the questions of 'what are goodand evil in a complex world' seem to be less deeply explored than before.  (There's tremendous room to explore 'what is guilt''what is mercy' and 'what is evil' in this particular season, and in the end the answers given seem a bit too neat.)There are also episodes in the middle that feel a bit dull, as if treading water. Perhaps this season would have been strongeras 5 or 6 episodes.Certainly good television, and worth watching, but for the first time I found myself less emotionally moved, and more apt tofind my mind wandering. The climax (which in some ways feels like a natural ending to the series) certainly makes up for alot of that, but not all of it.",1356998400,2013-01-01

5.0,"I love British television. Inspector Lewis, and Sgt Hathaway, are two of the best characters I have seen.  With each new season they have become more and more real, like two friends I want to hear how their day went.  Kevin Whately has done a wonderful job of growing his character from sidekick to star; a leader with a disarming folksy charm.  The bad guys just don't see him coming because they don't think he is a threat.  Laurence Fox plays Hathaway like you would expect some one to play a valuable violin; every note is perfect.  In each episode Hathaway is revealed in a slightly different way, but it feels like you are just gradually getting to know him.  Great characters.  Great stories.  This one makes me want to beg for more.",1385683200,2013-11-29
5.0,"Outstanding performances, excellent writers.  I saw the natural spark in Jonny Lee Miller in Eli Stone 2008.  I enjoyed his character as Jordan Chase in Dexter 2010.  But he has taken the golden ring as Sherlock.  WOW ! ! The combination of Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu is star-struck.  The only note I would add is that some of the episodes are EXTREMELY complicated when others or EXTREMELY low-keyed.  Both I really enjoy, but the complicated plots are much more interesting.  I am glad that they slowed Sherlock's speech down a bit.  He can talk so fast, I can't understand what he says.  His soft, sometimes whispered lines are great - even soft spoken, you can still hear exactly what he is saying.  GREAT SHOW ! TOP-NOTCH Entertainment.",1382572800,2013-10-24

5.0,"The Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave in southern France contains the oldest known cave paintings -- works of remarkable beauty and detail that are all the more amazing for being more than 30,000 years old. Since access to the cave is highly restricted, Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams 3D is the next best thing to being there, and what a delightful, awe-inspiring tour it is. The 3D is used to terrific effect here -- you can practically smell the dankness of the caves, and you'll constantly feel the urge to duck stalactites -- and the paintings are gobsmackingly beautiful and haunting -- ""the birth of the modern human soul,"" as Herzog describes it. If you don't have a 3D TV, the Cave Blu-ray/3D Blu-ray combo still allows you to check out the movie, but be aware: this is one movie that really does look better in all three dimensions.",1323475200,2011-12-10

5.0,"I've seen Brenda Blethyn in several British films and her ability to absorb herself into her characters is almost frightening.  It would be wonderful to sit down with her to find out what she's really like.  In this series, she is an introverted detective, with almost no people skills except when she's interacting with victims and suspects; then she can be utterly kind, patient and understanding until she's gotten what she needs to solve the crime.  Yet, there is something in the character and the performance that makes you long to understand her.  Some clues as to how she became who is is, are given when she speaks of her distant and difficult father, with whom she had a troubled relationship.  Over the series they seem to be revealing more about her youth.  The mysteries are well done, very much character driven and always contain surprising elements and twists that are frequently based on both victims' and perpetrators' inability to understand and cope with each other, their own desires and life itself.Vera's relationship with her team is also interesting; she can bellow with the best of them, but there is some kindness there when she's reminded that these people are human.  Her relationsip with her her right arm, John, is fascinating.  Initially he cannot get a handle on her personality but when he does he manages to work with her and even understand her.  When Vera attends his daughter's first communion he quietly hands her a gift to give to the child since he knows it simply will not occur to her to do so. In a scene where she has reluctaintly agreed to have dinner with his family, she sits across from his wife and looks so absolutely at sea, totally unable to cope with a simple dinner that it is painful to watch and she abruptly ends the meal and leaves; stunning acting.  Lovely, well done complex stories and I hope to see more.",1389484800,2014-01-12

3.0,"The Movie Fargo was unequivocally 5 star cinema. The TV version is a derivative of that film, so it has quite a challenge to live up to. All in all, compared to the film, I would give it close to 3.5 stars and improving, especially with episode 6. Despite all the extra time to fill, the masks of evil portrayed are overtly simplified rather than fleshed out. Instead, the extra hours are crafted to showcase acts of violence: violence that is varyingly diabolical, cruel, collateral and/or tragic.  I concede that the characters killed in graphic detail are those that are drawn as idiotic cartoon characters, while animals (a dog, a deer and fish) and ""innocents"" have been the spared the lewd blood gushing effects. However, from my viewpoint, all this violence does not intrigue, it repulses.Fargo's ""good"" and lovable characters, Molly and Gus, have short quirky chats over meals and coffee. Imagining what's going on inside their heads is my favorite aspect of the series. Colin Hanks played a not wildly dissimilar character as a Dallas P.D. cop in a short-lived TV comedy 3 or 4 years ago, so he feels like an old friend. Mr Hanks is perfectly cast here, as is newcomer Allison Tolman as a heartfelt and intelligent Molly. Martin Friedman, whose central portrayal of Lester Nygaard is also excellent, despite being hard to feel much sympathy for until episode 5 (when his propensity for being a victim hovers on terminal). At the close of episode 6, Mr. Friedman has the truly brilliant understated acting moment of the series, smiling to himself as he sits rigidly on his hospital bed.Billy Bob Thornton plays Malvo (short for malevolent?) mostly in deadpan, but becomes astutely animated in a wicked bit as ""The Pastor"". As the most deadly of human animal species (the brilliant sociopath), Malvo seems invincible, like a human ""terminator"". He appears to have no urges that amount to weakness or even vague pleasure. (I don't think we've even seen him with a cup of coffee).  I guess he's been too caught up in honing his talents: tracking ""prey"", murder, , etc., and in the rare spare moment he humiliates random strangers. (What a fun guy.) While I think Thornton's portrayal of the aloof Malvo is uncanny, I wish the scripting could add as much as Thorton's acting.The episodes have been hurt by lewd clownish villains, preposterous details of Malvo's ""biblically styled"" terrors, and full-screen grisly portraits of murder victims. Very low common denominator stuff.Still, the acting makes this show worth watching.",1400889600,2014-05-24

3.0,"I didn't even realize this pilot existed until this morning. As a fan of Michael Connelly and his characters, I was extremely excited to see Detective Bosch in action. I've read roughly 7 to 10 from the Bosch series and all of the Lincoln Lawyer novels (as far as I know).I had issue with the very first scene. Never a good thing to start off a show with doubts. From my recollection, Bosch despises having partners and prides himself on being a lone wolf, or perhaps coyote is more apt. I vaguely recall Edgar being mentioned here and there in the books, but he barely registered in any of them. The pilot makes Edgar play a much larger role, which I'm not sure that I'm OK with. Part of me thinks it might help the Bosch character verbalize things that would normally be internal dialogue in the novels.I felt disappointed that the pilot did not focus that much on Bosch's amazing knack for clues and detective work in general. It slightly hinted towards it here and there, but when you only have one chance to make an impression, such as a possible one-time pilot, you need to make it something memorable. They failed in this regard. However, they were able to capture his dedication to the job, as demonstrated when he steals case files and visits crime scenes late into the night.Perhaps I was expecting too much based on my readings of the novels. I think the ultimate test is the answer to the question, would I watch it on a regular basis if I had no prior knowledge of the books. To be completely honest, based solely on the pilot I can say a definite no. It didn't stand out any from the many other detective/courtroom dramas already in production. Maybe as the character is able to be developed more, if the series is picked up, things will improve. For the time being, Bosch needs to work on making a name for himself before it is too late.",1393286400,2014-02-25
3.0,"A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if  death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body/mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended? That's a good question that I don't have a glib answer for . . . those considering an intervention? Substance abusers? Those interested in human behavior? Perhaps one episode if you are interested in finding a few answers to your own questions.I've viewed 'Chasing The White Dragon,' 'The Global Addiction,' 'Afghanistan: The Opium Trail,' and 'One Man's Seduction.'  If you have an interest in grower to user, 'The Global Addiction' is a 30 min overview by ABC Australia, that is well narrated and reasonably accurate.[Season 10 review]",1398988800,2014-05-02

3.0,"This was a somewhat objective presentation of Wikileaks during its first few years. Interviewees range from former NSA officials to former Wikileaks employees and volunteers. The main character profiled, of course, is Julian Assange. Assange is portrayed as a hero for some, flawed computer geek to others, and narcissistic criminal to still more. Also profiled are Bradley Manning and Adrian Lamo, both of whom served to muddy the already murky business of leaking secrets to the general public. All three of these real-life people appear, in the documentary, to have mental health issues while enjoying access to sensitive information. This is the recipe for the disaster played out on front pages of newspapers over some time.This documentary seems to strive for impartiality, but ultimately fails, as many documentaries do. We have plenty of opportunity to consider as many possible sides to an issue, organization or public personality when forming an opinion.If I had it to do over again, I would have passed on paying $6.99 to rent this movie.

4.0,"I've read a couple of true-crime books from Stephen Williams, probably the guy on the planet who knows the most about Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo, AKA Leanne Bordelais and Paul Teale.  ""Invisible Darkness"" was a gripping read, while ""Karla:  Deal with the Devil"" wasn't quite as good, as the second book was a little too scattershot to enjoy, if one may ""enjoy"" reading a book about serial killers.But in those books, Mr. Williams indicts not only Ms. Bordelais and Mr. Teale, but he indicts the Canadian judicial system and the police as well.  The police liked to change their stories during the trials of the married couple -- they were tried separately near Toronto -- and the police used whatever narrative that they believed would be the most helpful at the time.  ""Ms. Homolka is an evil monster,"" during her own trial, followed by, ""Ms. Homolka is was an abused wife of a sociopathic monster,"" at Mr. Bernardo's trial.  And the police and judicial system convinced psychiatrists to give both sides of the story as well.How did they do this?  Well, the police had their own agendas, and so did the judicial system.  But so did the psychiatrists.  And this is what I actually thought of immediately when Laurence Fishburne is discussing strategy in a recent episode of ""Hannibal"" with two psychiatrists that work for Mr. Fishburne:  Mads Mikkelsen -- AKA Dr. Hannibal Lecter -- and Caroline Dhavernas -- Dr. Alana Bloom.  Well, Mr. Lecter gives the answer that fits Mr. Fishburne's ""agenda"" -- Mr. Fishburne's words and not mine -- the best.  Guess who Mr. Fishburne ultimately listened to for advice?And this, in a nutshell, is one reason why I really like this series.  It is very realistic in the sense that the characters have their own agendas, and they may be more than willing to discuss those agendas and push them in this fine television show.  But there is something else that they do that's really smart here.  Even though the audience knows that Dr. Lecter is a really bad guy -- or at least will become one as this is a prequel to the movies -- he's oddly more of a sympathetic character when juxtaposed against Ms. Dhavernas.  She seems to have an agenda as well, and that agenda seems to be purely political.  And everybody hates a weasel like her.  So it's pretty danged nifty how they make the audience like a serial killer such as Mr. Lecter more than someone like Ms. Dhavernas.  Nice trick.And the lead -- Hugh Dancy -- is also really good.  He's always on edge, but he's supposed to be.  You don't know if he'll go all crazy either, and you kind of get a feeling that he just might kill somebody at any old time.  He even says as much in this recent episode, words that he may later learn to regret.  Stay tuned.Well, everybody loves serial killers nowadays, from what it seems, at least if you look at the latest television listings.  We have ""The Bates Motel,"" another series that I really like.  We have ""Hannibal,"" which is at least as good, perhaps better.  And then we have ""The Following,"" in my opinion a series that will most likely be cannibalized by both.",1366329600,2013-04-19

4.0,"I have been a huge fan of Zoey Deschanel ever since she was in A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. She also made appearances in several of my other favorite films including The Bridge to Tarabithia and Tin Man.  Zoey has a unique beauty and a witty personality that makes her shine in any role she undertakes and New Girl is no different.  In this funny series a young girl moves in with three bachelors. That would lead to comic episodes no matter what, but  Jessie and her quirky habits and New Age ideas don't always fly with the All-American men she resides with and more than once, personalities clash.  The story line was pretty predictable in most cases, but told with humor and personality that made it seem more interesting. Jake M. Johnson, Max Greenfield, and Lamorne Morris also add a healthy dose of eye candy. I love the show and I'm hoping it lasts a few more seasons, but I think the writers will have to pull some more original content in the coming season for this to work out.",1353196800,2012-11-18

1.0,"08/28/2013 UPDATE- last night's episode was yet more proof that this show is really just derailed. According to the newest installment, it makes perfect sense that Auggie was actually a CIA operative FIRST in 2006, THEN joined the military, where he was blinded in 2007, and then went back to the CIA. Yeahhhhh, that's definitely a totally believable career progression. I mean, at this rate, the details of this season border on sci-fi. And Piper Perabo's acting is getting more and more stilted, making you think that she's planning her own exit or bored to tears with the script. RIDICULOUS.=============================================================================================================================ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've been watching this show from the beginning, and was already a little apprehensive about the somewhat predictably lame season 3 ending of Auggie and Annie falling into bed together (SNORE!). But I was completely unprepared for just how BAD this season would be. Not only does their relationship take center stage - right along with little inserts of the crumpled, limping relationship between Arthur and Joan who, surprise surprise, TV once again manages to produce a miracle and makes her pregnant at whatever age she's supposed to be (the actress herself being 43).I'm not sure what's worse in the show so far: the incredibly AWFUL, bad, awkward relationship between Auggie and Annie - replete with some of the worst cliches and stale lines you remember from bad 70s and 80s movies - that's so embarrassingly bad that you're variously wondering how the acting in a show can get WORSE with continuing seasons whent the actors should now be firmly entrenched in their characters, or think that it's as awkward as watching a real life brother-sister team fake a romantic relationship (yuck). Yes, it's THAT bad.And while there are the occasional moments when the show briefly returns to its former gusto, the thrills and suspense of previous seasons are few and far between. Mostly you witness Piper Perabo acting like she just got off the bus in Hollywood yesterday (and, let's face it, she's come a long way since Coyote Ugly) - and one can only hope that real spies have better skills than her because when you see scenes where she strolls around like Bambi, blissfully unaware of all the DANGERS!! around her, always waiting for some guy to rescue her...it's so groan-worthy that you just want to throw a well-heeled shoe at the tv and yell MAKE THEM STOP!All of those things just seem to be distractions from a lack of well-written storylines that initially drew me - and presumably others - to this show, which now stumbles clumsily from one eye-roll-inducing scene to the next.The show seems to have become a really tragic hybrid between a bad episode of Law & Order and a day-time soap - if it wasn't for the fact that I've got cable and the other shows I enjoy watching are on hiatus until the fall, I wouldn't be giving this the time of day at all anymore. I keep hoping that it'll get better, but so far it's just one bad episode after the next.",1376438400,2013-08-14

4.0,"First off, let me say I thought this film was good, full of action & excitement, but having watched all the shows (except Voyager) & all 10 past films, I really was disappointed that the writers & filmakers chose an alternate timeline, Vulcan's destruction & the death of Spock's mother makes some ""TOS"" episodes & the films ""Star Trek I, III, & IV"" no longer exist, this is quite a disappointment, & the fact that the show ""Enterprise"" has been constantly critisized for certain inconsistencies & no one is making that same argument here based on current reviews leads me to think that those critical of ""Enterprise"" never really watched it or they just didn't like Scott Bakula's Captain Archer, anyway despite this, the film is well done, Karl Urban really captures Dr.McCoy's mannerisms, no suprise there, he did the same thing playing a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Woodrow Call for ""Commanche Moon""(""Lonesome Dove's"" prequel), the guys playing the younger Spock & Sulu were really good picks & very true to the characters, Sulu weilded a sword in the TOS episode ""Naked Now"" & the woman playing Uhura was also a good pick, Bruce Greenwood was very commanding a Pike, much like the original character, however I am still unsure about Chris Pine as Kirk, sure he captured some of Shatner's mannerisms, but I am not sure he really looks the part, I had a hard time believing he could evolve into William Shatner, the guy playing his dad at the beginning looked more like a young Shatner than Pine did, & would have been a better choice I think, Simon Pegg was half & half on Scotty, he had the mannerism, but was bit goofy, unlike the original Scotty, Ben Cross was good as Spock's father Sarek, as was Winona Ryder as his mother Amanda, they really reminded me of the older counterparts in the 80's films, & finally Eric Bana is again underused here just as he was in ""Troy"" who's Romulan echoes that of the Picard's clone in ""Nemesis"", in fact it seems they couldn't come up with nothing but a retread of ""Nemesis'"" villian here, this is what happens when you put a non-fan in the director's chair like J.J. Abrams, who is a good director, but him being a non-fan really shows here, again you would think that Paramount would have learned from all the complaints fans had about Rick Berman & Brannon Braga on ""Enterprise"",but then again do stuido cheifs really care about this franchise? NO!!! just how much it will make & what name they can attach to it, this new film is an attempt to capture new fans & give older fans the finger in the name of the almighty dollar, however when you watch ST:NG's ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", there are parallels somewhat in regard to an alternate timeline, & ""Deep Space Nine"" was guilty of doing episodes like this too, as did ""Enterprise"" with the ""Mirror Darkly"" episodes, which is how I see this film, an alternate timeline pure & simple, can't hate this one since the shows did it too.",1241827200,2009-05-09
4.0,"19 Episodes on 5 DiscsHaving never watched ""Saving Grace"" before, I didn't know what to really expect from this series. Academy Award winner Holly Hunter heads up the cast as Grace, a detective who happens to have a guardian angel named Earl. A show like this could easily get preachy and turn certain people off, but I was surprised to find it presented in such an even matter that most people could stick with it.Grace herself is a flawed character and no angel. Grace isn't sure what she believes and doesn't pray. Not being perfect and having lots of issues as well as a tough job facing homicides, bombings, and a near-death experience makes her someone to root for. Holly Hunter is a down-home kind of girl with a very distinctive accent that clearly dictates she does not believe she is better than anyone else. The short version is that she is the opposite of every stereotype naysayers might expect and she is very easy to relate to since she doesn't have all the answers.Holly Hunter's wit, enthusiasm, and sense of humor when things are going down around her are very attractive and charismatic qualities. She pulls out serious acting chops of emotion whenever she needs to as in one case where Grace needs to convince an alcoholic that she is one too and trick her into breaking her three year sobriety to get answers. Hunter never shies away from a challenge and always manages to bring the mood back to a light place full of laughs eventually.A great deal of this season revolves around a girl who falls into a coma that Earl claims Grace needs to help. A series of challenges are put in front of her in her work life, her family, her relationships, and her friends. Eventually her own spirituality and faith are questioned, but only in retrospect to bigger issues taking place in the plot.There is a love interest component, a best friend angle, and lots of crime drama to solve and all this helps keep it a more rounded story.Bonus Features: None",1283817600,2010-09-07
5.0,"This is the season when Dean dies because he has dealt Sam's survival in the place of his own life by trading his soul with a demon, and he got a one year delay before going to hell. The whole season is going to turn around the dilemma for Sam and for Dean. Sam will resist the idea of Dean's death and will do all he can to save him, including by dealing his own death instead, but Dean is willing to die since he-they has-have given everything to this war against the Monster, the yellow eyed demon that killed their mother, and that they supposedly killed at the end of the second season, and this war has brought them nothing as for life, enjoying life, etc. Better dying than just surviving on nothing at all, or even a dry bone. For Sam the only problem is that Dean's death means he will be alone to go on with this fight and that frightens him though we see him operating a couple of times alone and he can manage properly.We could think then the season would be rather dull. But there you are wrong and the next season is being prepared very carefully.First it is fun to fight demons. So we have a Christmas special this year, and a real Christmas special it is with reminiscences from the past when the two little boys were alone for Christmas when their father was hunting. And neither of them both forgot to get a present, no matter how little, for the other since anyway Dean did not believe in Father Christmas and Sam was told it was all a fake, a scam, a tall tale. But the Christmas party they enjoy now with two nice little Celtic survivors who decide to have some fun for this Christmas and enjoy a good old cannibalistic feast gives quite some enlightening for to the celebration. We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas, and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas, though the series being in real time, there is no reason why Christmas should not be present, especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn, some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father, looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House. One of the dummies will die in the adventure, the intern of course which does not count much, not one of the brains of the caper, and they will not be able to put the money in their bank though because Sam and Dean have manipulated their computers with a big magnet that erased all the programs, reformatted the hard disk in a jiffy.Third let's think of the poor children that are chased away from the TV and this series because of the gross nature of these horrible monsters. So let's have one full episode on fairy tales. Unluckily it is a girl in a coma who should have been unplugged from the survival equipment a long time ago by her own father, the doctor, who is reenacting in real life the fairy tales her father is telling her in her coma. The versions of Snow White and the Little Red Riding Hood are amazing and the way Sam and Dean manage to save the poor Little Red Riding Hood from the Big Bad Wolf is heroic and absolutely entertaining for very young children who will be able to learn that they must not go alone to the woods nor get in the cars of strangers.But the war against evil is serious and has little to do with a fairy tale. So let's go back to work, boys.This year is built on the presence of two women. Bela, who could be Bella of course, is a girl whose specialty is to steal ancient objects in order to sell them for a profit. She steals anything the boys, particularly Dean, may have in their pockets. A mummified hand for example, an enchanted rabbit's foot or the famous colt that can kill the Demon with one bullet. But that is too much, far too much and that will lead to the ferocious end of Dean being taken to hell by the Hounds of Hell and will end up, like in Hellraiser and Hellbound, two fairy tales told in many chapters and volumes by Saint Clive Barker, stretched out at the tip end of hooks tied up to chains that are going to dismember him forever and ever, each body part growing back after having been ripped off, I guess. A delicious ending for a monster hunter.A second woman, Ruby, who is a demon possessing a woman, is going to haunt the two boys because she wants to help and Sam is ready if not keen to listen and accept. But Dean and Sam refuse bluntly when she suggests to Sam to learn how to use his psychic power that can defeat Lilith, the demon who is after Dean's life. So he can't in the final confrontation with the girl who was possessed by Lilith and had caused a lot of damage, who has been able to get a whole gang of demons in the neighbors all around, so that the boys are trapped when they finally come into the house where the girl is living. And at the very last minute when Sam is going to kill her he is stopped by Dean who is able to feel demons since he is minutes away from Hell. Lilith in fact is in the body of Ruby who is possessed twice and since the boys do not have the special colt they can't kill the spirit Lilith in Ruby. The spirit keeps them at bay till midnight when the Hounds of Hell are introduced to get Dean away. She is so powerful she can keep Sam at bay against the wall but at the last minute the spirit Lilith goes away leaving Dean in Hell, Sam beaten up against the wall and Ruby with no good sense left in her. End of the season. Let's wait for the next one to revive the good Dean.But there is even more in this season that prepares the next season. They get rid of Gordon, the black hunter and some of his acolytes, all of them black except one. They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few. But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter. Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated, three of them black. If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice, what is it then? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their nave feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do, though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them, save humanity.At the same time another black character is redeemed, Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is possessed. He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt. But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station. The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy. And the boys exorcise the demon out of him. It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption: the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula. Brilliant. He let the two boys go, but they will learn later with Ruby on TV that the Demon Lilith, possessing a little blonde girl (evil can be everywhere and come in all forms) came herself afterward to get some vengeance and she destroyed the police station into ashes on the ground killing all those inside and close to it, including of course the redeemed FBI Special Agent. Isn't that sad? The two boys have it more and more difficult to save one person and when they do then the demon kills a dozen outsiders and innocent bystanders. But the redemption of Victor Henricksen, Special Agent by profession, is good news after all since that one was saved before being destroyed. His soul will go where it should and that is not in hell.The last remark I would like to make on this series is the great number of allusions to other classics in the field. The Shining by Stephen King is so often alluded too that I will not even specify. Come with me, Come with me, come with me, and you will know. Of course you also have Clive Barker at the end. But you have so many others like the Night of the Living Dead and in a way Michael Jackson's Thriller, If you do have some time and energy left when you have finished watching the next three seasons I would advise you to go back and identify them all. And that's where plagiarism is not what it used to be. Plagiarism used to make pale imitations of real stuff with tit bits stolen here and there, like Canada Dry instead of Whisky and ginger ale instead of real ale. We could of course think of the fake Frankenstein's monster who is the doctor himself and who has become immortal by substituting in his own body the parts that are getting old. Mad scientist, mad doctor, or whatever. There are so many of them running loose and free around in the street. Aren't you afraid of going out to smoke your cancer stick in the yard? I would be if I were you. You might be snatched by two moths from out space. Plagiarism you said? The pleasure is not plagiarized though.I will not insist on the debate between the two brothers and the love that becomes at times dense and impressive, but also at times pathetic and our empathy for the death of the elder brother is wearing out, especially since we know there are three more seasons to go and a fourth one running right now. But the car is also less present in this season. Sam has his own, by the way, and the Impala seems to have been reduced to a gadget in these episodes. It is present for sure, but certainly less than before. I hope it is not for long because I like the machine. The car seems to be less present since their future as a pair of hunters is compromised. They own the car together and it brings them together. The car being their only real possession, something they inherited from their father and that created a unity in their family, keeping them close and bringing them from one point to another together. On the trail leading to Dean's death, the car cannot keep them together or close, because one will surely die and the other is trying to save him by following new paths to save him, sometimes in ill-advised directions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE",1322697600,2011-12-01

3.0,"This is a zomedy movie.  Not a zombie movie. Although it does of course feature zombies. In this case green moss takes people over and they become zombies.This is a campy movie and has scenes  which are pure camp with over the top things like ' banners that appear and say 'barachi brothers attack"".  etc. And of course our heroes , two arab dutch guys , and two black dutch guys and  blonde hot dutch woman battle the zombies and get lots of green slime on them and don't change into zombies. Unless they are bitten. So on that level , logic is thrown out the window. But this is not a serious movie. It's got lots of zombies that get blown away though and decent special effects , especially the cgi space station that crashes into Holland.  But serious zombie fans are going to be not too happy with this is they want a non comedy zombie flick. It's in dutch with English subtitles and if you can't enjoy a movie that's not in English , well that's sorta sad , just because you have to read subs?.  This film is often silly and meant to be. The gore and such are just part of the whole backdrop. ANd the ending is well really dumb. But it's a comedy so they just threw that in.  In hd this looks good but the film it was shot on , was rather dark?. I don't know. But in this case the hd wasn't stand out as I would have hoped. But it's better the standard version.",1377734400,2013-08-29

I do think it was a mistake toremove the head of atlantis; the dr. wier character from the show, just as removing  Dr. Becket character from the previous series was not the best move in my opinion.  Still it takes guts to remove major characters and the Samantha Carter character does a good job at being the bases new leader. She has to let the others do most of the work though as she mainly runs the base.  I still loved the show though due to it's overall quality and fine acting so it's worth watching for even non stargate fans who enjoy good sci fi that is very well made.",1222300800,2008-09-25

3.0,"John Moon (Sam Rockwell) is a bad poacher, having been caught three times. He can keep a job, in fact he has kept many of them. He is also not the most careful hunter as he irresponsibly and accidentally shoots a woman (Lana Giacose). As any good citizen, he robs her and hides the body.  In fact she has a whole box full of money. Our protagonist is not the nicest person in the world.A couple other things that John is not good at are relationships and hiding money. His wife (Kelly Reilly) wants a divorce as John consults the town's most inexpensive attorney (William Macy) whose judgement in suits and hair pieces leads one to believe he doesn't know how to use a mirror. As it turns out the dead girl had a boyfriend (Ted Levine) who knows John has his money and he wants it back.It is difficult to hide things in a small town as the plot develops some minor complexity. The good, the bad, and the ugly of this film is the fact that it captures the rural flavor of the community with local euphemisms, accents, and slow motion talking. Depending on one's viewpoint, this can make or break the movie. John Moon, is well meaning when it comes to his family, but he is not all good and far from the brightest bulb in the pack.A redneck art film.

3.0,"Just about the time that I thought just about every possible variant on the TV cop/detective/crime solving show had been explored by the creative geniuses who provide our nightly broadcast television ration of pap, piddle and trivia -whoa - here came a show that tickled our Sherlock Holmesian/forensic knowledge fancy.  Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross-out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of'  ""Built to Kill"" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt-casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in ""Living Legend"".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the ""miniature"" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the ""Miniature Murders"" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch-to-a-foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half-inch-to-a-foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full-sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio. Other extras include commentary tracks for seven episodes, and a tour of the real CSI-Las Vegas offices; which, astonishingly enough, are very much more cluttered and not nearly as plush-looking as the series sets.",1237680000,2009-03-22

5.0,"Note: I saw every episode of this show via XFinity On Demand, in HD.CBS' latest new sicence-fiction-action-drama is PERSON OF INTEREST, with a twist. Instead of getting numbers from a Machine, the lead solves crimes with the extraordinary help of a chip implanted in his brain. Plus, there's a beautiful Secret Service Agent (Meghan Orry, who guest-starred/was a season regular on ONCE UPON A TIME) assigned to protect him. Their superior? A tough, but very understanding woman (Marg Helgenberger, who cracked cold cases alongside Gil Grissom, Raymond Langston and D.B. Russell on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation). The concept of the show is brilliantly executed, and the dialogue is smartly written, with Gabriel and Riley's interactions always providing humour into what would otherwise be a serious procedural, ala HANNIBAL.I hope the show gets renewed for a second season.EDIT - 10 May 2014INTELLIGENCE has been cancelled. I guess the concept was too intelligent for the doltish idiots at CBS. At least, it didn't end on a cliffhanger, like so many other shows (yes, I'm talking to YOU, Fox & ABC, for cancelling Almost Human, Charlie's Angels, Missing, Killer Women, Betrayal & Lois And Clark: The New Adventures Of Superman. Each of these well-written shows ended on cliffhangers that will unfortunately never be resolved, plus ABC doltishly chose to air the middle part of a IV-part storyline as the series finale).",1396569600,2014-04-04

As Morse and Lewis dig deeper and deeper, several possible suspects emerge as to who might like to keep the information quiet, and who has the most to lose if the secrets are uncovered regarding the circumstances surrounding the crime and why it was never resolved.These shows may seem slow-moving compared to current mysteries, but the magic is in the script and acting.

Hence why he doesn't trust anyone.  The great thing about the series is he is the fastest lawman in the territory and he doesn't take grief from anyone.  This leads to him getting whooped up once in awhile by the bad guys, rednecks, and other degenerates, but nonetheless you know what he stands for.  The storys are all good ranging from family feuds to a statewide manhunt.  Raylan is after the man that brought drugs to Harlan and that has been hiding out from the mob for thirty years or anyone else looking to collect the ever growing ransom.

Well, yes, in the big city hospital but Hank's bro Evan whisks him off for a weekend jaunt in the Hamptons.  Here they finagle an invite to a high end Par-Tay & he proceeds to use his newfound Jungle Medicine Powers on a party goer.The brothers are invited to stay in the guest house of a rich enigmatic German who Hank refers to as your typical Bond villain - probably because of the shark tank in the basement.  The brother Evan is a CPA who's always looking for an available female and/or a new rich client for HANK/MED, the medical corporation he's set up.  This starts the trip down the newfound life path as a concierge doctor to the rich.A great assortment of offbeat medical emergencies present themselves each week from upper respiratory infections presenting at a dog's Bark Mitzvahs to tracking devices hidden in boobie implants by jealous hubbies.  Hank meets each riddle with aplomb and MacGyver tactics.I think Hank may be too serious & Evan too foolish but they play off each other well and the result is a believable sibling rivalry.

5.0,"It's no secret that Marvel Studios has been killing it lately, releasing at least two huge comic book adaptations every year. In 2013 we had the box-office sensations that were &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; and &#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34;, which both made back their colossal budgets, and then some. And with the original Captain America having equal success back in the summer of 2011, Marvel was smart to get a sequel in the works. Starting off this movie-filled summer with a bang, &#34;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#34; is a pleasure to watch, and shows just what Marvel can do.Picking up where the first film left off, we see Steve Rogers as he struggles to embrace his role in the 21st century, and as he battles various threats alongside Shield. With a new villain called The Winter Soldier wreaking havoc, his world begins to crumble, and he doesn't know who to trust. Forced to team up with his only allies, Black Widow and Nick Fury, he works to find the source of the threat that could quickly endanger America.Action-packed and full of priceless comedic moments, this is a blast to see on the big screen. With plenty of fantastic acting, mostly from the three leads, it may be one of the strongest Marvel movies out there. Rated PG-13 for action sequences, &#34;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#34; is more than fun, it's great.",1396828800,2014-04-07

4.0,"Joan Collins was the woman everyone watched on DYNASTY, an evening soap which ran a few decades ago. Madeline Stowe has donned that mantle as the matriarch everyone loves to hate as Victoria Grayson in REVENGE. Whenever she is on camera with another character, you know the claws are coming out!  I especially like it when her ex husband gets into it with her. They can't stand one another and just spit and claw at one another when forced to be in the same room, which is frequently.Emily, our revenge prone protagonist, is actually a little tiresome in comparison. Her harping on and on about her revenge is turning everyone off. However, what is taking over as an issue for her, which may take over the revenge plot, is that her mother has now appeared.  She is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. I am really looking forward to seeing Stowe and Leigh come together.  That should be fun, especially since Stowe was the one who stashed her in the nut house.I actually did not think I would like this but Stowe made me a convert.",1350864000,2012-10-22
4.0,"I liked this whole series, except for the occasional stupid writing errors, or stupid barriers to the actin or stupid, sudden way-too-easy resolves, or how she can shoot anyone in the forehead from any position at any time, yet can get captured if someone says boo to her - just stupid writing creeping in. The actors are all top level performances, not too much over-the-top or unnecessary stiffness or quirky alien stuff - all very well performed. Of course the stupidest thing of all is that because they 'won', it all never happened - so why'd we watch? Think about it...",1388880000,2014-01-05
5.0,I really enjoy this show because of the unusual characters and I like that they wear white hats while being faced with difficult moral choices all of the time.  Interesting show...and those kind of things probably really go on in our political arena.,1363305600,2013-03-15
4.0,"To fully appreciate this film, you need a background in, and appreciation for, Buddhism and the eastern concepts of karma, reincarnation, and the transmigration of souls.  I do, and I liked it.  It's very slow-moving, atmospheric, gorgeously photographed, the acting is naturalistic and the dialogue minimal.  It has fantasy princesses, lonely ghosts, red-eyed gorilla-like creatures, randy catfish, bored monks, annoying mosquitoes, bees and honey, and a minimalist plot.  Uncle Boonmee is dying of kidney disease and his city slicker sister and her son come to visit him at his farm to help him out.  That's the premise, but it's so much more than that.My favorite line from the film, as delivered by Boonmee's ghost wife Huay:  ""Heaven is over-rated.  There's nothing there.""  Something I've always strongly suspected!",1389830400,2014-01-16

3.0,"Although the history of the peoples and the estate was well developed, there was a number of things that did not measure up in my book for the title word SECRETS.......I was looking to find out more about the buildings, including various passageways, and delving deeper into the make up and designs of the many rooms of the estate.  It was good to learn about how once again the US and England have very close ties and that there were factions in England that supported the independence.  That too was an area that could have been spoken of in greater length, so that we could understand the reasons why they supported independence.  Diana was a great lady and she will be missed by all of us who matured along with her through the years.  Please look at continuing on with a second part about the estates.",1394236800,2014-03-08

We all know the SYFY channel is continuing to crank out godawful, unoriginal trash with abandon but even this falls below their ""standards"". The creature ""effects"" may even have been lifted from an old SYFY flick - or a coloring book - not sure ...I gave it a star only because I couldn't submit a review otherwise.

3.0,"Putting aside that this was another film with unlikeable characters doing dumb things in an unexplained end-of-humanity non-plot, I was still hoping the Blu would have some stellar extras and picture quality (with all of the darks and shadows). Unfortunately, the special features are some of the worst inclusions I have seen on a film like this, and the only thing giving this some higher marks was the 7.1 DTS.The story follows four people wallowing through their idiocies in trying to survive some unknown catastrophe that leaves a city (played by Detroit - which was a better character than everyone here) devoid of people. Some bad CGI shadows follow them around trying to gobble them up sans their clothing. I would have to say some typecasting has to occur here when you have Hayden Christiansen walking around with a hood barely showing his face for several sequences, followed by someone holding a long green glow stick baring resemblance to a certain weapon Hayden might be carrying in some other franchise. But anyway, the supplements are all in lodef and I listed all of the bad ones first:* Alternate endings, 3 or 4 at 8:20 minutes. Please take my advice and skip these. They are no different except for one alternate camera angle and a different sunset - nothing changes from the film.* Revealing 7th Street (making of), 7:04 minutes. Talking heads & really bad insight by the cast on the film and story.* Creating the Mood of 7th, 7:04 minutes. They essentially took the cuts from the first one and made this longer one, but with reasons for why they chose Detroit. Which I have to say I am not sure if all of the reasoning made Detroit seem worse (""gothic"", ""Dead"" etc.), or they just didn't realize they were saying it.* Behind the scenes montage, 2:11 minutes. Several identical cuts from the other two quips, with no dialogue. Would be best as a workbook for the staff of the film, otherwise a complete skipper.* HDNet Promo, 4:19 minutes (In HD). The standard trailer length plug.* Fangoria Interviews, 2 @ 31 minutes. This was actually an insightful and thorough interview process and was better than the commentary. Thankfully, Brad takes up 22 minutes of the set and will be worth the watch for his fans. Jacob's lasts only a few minutes and the rest is clips of the film.* Dig Copy, not disc dependent.* Commentary, see Fangoria interview instead.I was not impressed with the film, the bad effects that shined through on BD, or the ending being given away on the cover art (so no surprise for me, that ending sucked anyway) but I was impressed with the 7.1 - maybe only getting used by the creature sounds at various times, but a nice immersion. English and Spanish subs, region A coded. Not worthy of a purchase but maybe a renter for the Hayden fans. 1.5 stars for the film, and 1.5 for the sound and Fangoria set.",1305244800,2011-05-13
4.0,"Actually a super creative offering. I quite enjoyed it. I did have to suspend disbelief more than once, like a 17 year old girl being able to hold her own with a werewolf? Really? And wow, a lot of murders, so many it was like water off a duck's back, as well as the werewolves being the least bloodthirsty of all, compared to a number of the humans they were practically Amnesty International. That being said, I thought it had a great assortment of actors, both young and older. Stiles is of course my favorite by far, so much so I'd hazard to guess that in my assessment he is the true star of the show. But all of them, bad guys and good, are really fun to watch. So much eye candy and talented, too. I have no hesitation recommending it. Fantabulous!",1370131200,2013-06-02
4.0,"I love seeing the zombies in varying states of ... umami but this show has really dragged for me and I really hate the commercial breaks BUT ever since the Season 2 finale, this has been a different show.  Having read the wikipedia on the comic, I dreaded Season 3 and while I hated the Andrea parts (unlike her conduct in the Season 2 finale), this season delivered so many more scenes that were just treats compared to the previous two seasons.I would definitely buy this season for the maximum price of $25.  I think it would be awesome to be able to sit through a commercial free marathon but if it is never priced right, I will just watch via netflix.I would never recommend Season 1 and 2 but this season was better than decent.  I noticed that Carol was practicing a la  Mengele when preparing for Lori giving birth but I never learned that this show is named after the musselman of concentration camps until I readMoni: A Novel of Auschwitz.  Unfortunately, that means that this  incredibly entertaining show is the delivery system for what the musselmen were living in the midst of i.e. the destruction and decay of murdered fellow inmates some missing body parts because of the starving prisoners delayed their own executions unlike the cannibalism for unity practiced by the Japanese army on Chinese citizens as well as Allied prisoners of war quarterway around the world at the same time.",1364947200,2013-04-03

5.0,"USA knows how to do summer television right. With hits like Psych and Burn Notice, it's difficult for the network to do any wrong. After tackling different sides of the law, USA decided to take on the unique and fascinating world of white-collar crime in their exciting new comedy police procedural White Collar.In White Collar viewers meet con man Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer), a sophisticated white-collar thief who has finally been put behind bars by his archnemesis CIA Special Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), an agent in the white-collar crime division. Just months before his parole comes up, Neal escapes from prison to track down his ex-girlfriend, Kate (Alexandra Daddario). Peter hunts him down, but finds that Neal may be helpful when it comes to solving white-collar crimes. After solving their first case together, Neal joins up with the CIA as a consultant and works with Peter to fight white-collar criminals.The centerpiece of the series is the hilarious relationship between Neal and Peter and the way they play off one another - basically bickering like an old married couple. Though I admit this relationship feel somewhat strained in a few episodes, it cleans up as the show goes on and the actors become more comfortable with the characters. Aside from Neal and Peter, the eccentric, quirky Mozzie (Willie Garson) constantly battles the pair for attention on scene and, honestly, occasionally wins. Garson's whimsical delivery and throughly developed character is one of the highlights of the show, and it'll be interesting to see how he continues to develop. Of course, you can't forget 90210 alum Tiffani Theissen as Peter's wife Elizabeth. Though she seems weak aside from some of the other characters, she's not the typical TV CIA wife and grows into her own lively character as the season goes on.Unlike the popular prime-time franchise CSI, White Collar focuses on sophisticated, high-end crimes such as art theft, forgery, fraud and embezzlement rather than violent crimes of passion.This allows for a fresh type of feel to police procedurals, rather than chasing criminals around New York or LA after discovering a murder, Neal and Peter put their heads together to unravel complex, sophisticated crimes that take a few more brain cells than the average murder.This three disc set is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound, but only in English. Subtitles are available in English, French and Spanish.The bonus materials were pretty good for the first season of a new show that USA was taking a gamble on. They include DVD staples such as a gag reel and deleted scenes - my personal favorites - and a handful of features that include interviews with cast and crew and a discussion of the crimes that inspired the episodes ""Pro and Con,"" ""A Cool Cat in the Hat,"" and ""Nothing But the Truth.""White Collar is another wonderful series from USA that breathes a refreshing summer breeze into some exciting television. If you haven't see the first season, you should pick it up before diving into season two, or else you'll miss some important plot points. Don't let this white-hot summer series pass you by.",1277856000,2010-06-30

5.0,"I would rate &#34;Justified&#34; with 4 1/2 stars if I could, but it is very close to perfection for me.  Interesting, quirky characters, action, suspense, and plenty of humor (although usually very dark).  I have to give most of the credit to the writers, but the acting by the entire cast is top notch.  Timothy Olyphant (Raylan) and Walton Goggins (Boyd) are incredible to watch, especially in the scenes they share together.  Jere Burns, as Wynn Duffy, turns in another great rendition of his signature creepy psychopath.  It's the eyes: even when he's not supposed to be creepy, he just is. Margo Martindale is exceptional (as always) in her role of Mags Bennett.  I've never seen a female villain quite like her.  She somehow manages to be sympathetic, which is very difficult to do.I would highly recommend &#34;Justified&#34; to anyone who enjoys character-driven drama or action-suspense mixed with the right amount of unconventional humor.  Just be prepared to be hooked; one episode quickly turns into three or four in one sitting!",1365811200,2013-04-13

The episodes are poignant and brilliantly acted.The directing and cinematography are very good, particularly for a network television program. The writing is crisp and authentic. Each character has a unique, resounding voice. Flawed and genuine, we keep watching, wishing our family had the kind of resolve the Braverman's have.The abundance of characters allows a smooth shifting between each life, allowing more realistic events to provide entertainment, drama and comedy.

3.0,"Period piece with lavish British upper class settings and extravagant life style. Beautiful scenery with physically attractive actors. Slow development of story and characters with too many flash backs, which create a loss of continuity in the events.Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall are perfectly cast as the cuckold, intellectual, honor -bound, stoic Christopher and his cheating conniving wife Sylvia. The supporting actors are just as good; Jack Huston (Potty Periwine) and Janet McTeer (Mrs. Satterthwaite) steal a few scenes.I endured the entire five episodes hoping for an upturn but the series fizzles at the end. As much as I liked Cumberbatch and Hall as actors I could not care for their characters. I cannot recommend this series.Beautiful costumes, beautiful art and natural settings. .Cumberbatch did his best as Christopher and Sylvia was wonderfully acted. as his despicable wife. The story was slow moving and the content has lost some of its relevancy in the 21 Century.

The &#34;Arrow&#34; as they refer to does do in the bad guys (That's kills them). Even in the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; Superman had to make a choice to save lives beyond the comic book image. The characters in the show draw on comic book characters in some way but with a twist. The Black Canary in &#34;Arrow&#34; is not the same as the comic book but the &#34;Huntress&#34; seems to be following the same type story line. Oliver Queen (The Arrow) has a family which adds to the plot. Also I'm learning some Russian from the show.,1388102400,2013-12-27

5.0,"To this day I still believe the 1st season is still the best season out of all the dexters. The future seasons tend to drag on too much and dexter doesn't get enough kills by taking out bad people from the world. The first season has nearly one bad person in each episode that dexter eliminates but as the season progresses to 2,3,4,5,6 etc you find that Dexter starts to get bored and is surrounded by so much life drama bull crap that he can't even kill anymore bad guys!",1364169600,2013-03-25

4.0,"Just to give you a heads up, this movie is definitely more humorous than scary. All in all, I found it to be quite entertaining though. To give a brief synopsis: This group of bank robbers are on the run from the police and they end up getting all tangled up in this evil witch convention in the process. Yes, the plot is more than a little over the top, but I encourage you to stay open minded. There's plenty of blood, guts, wild action scenes and gross-out moments. The movie also gives a different take on that good old battle of the sexes theme. Both the special effects and the acting were surprisingly good. Thumbs up! This one is a gem!",1405728000,2014-07-19
5.0,"Curious George has been a classic for years, however, I believe that the Curious George show is better than ever.  There is always a lesson hidden in these adorable episodes.  My son LOVES to watch it, and I am happy to let him watch.  They discuss topics from counting to instruments, colors, nature etc.  The graphics are wonderful and sharp, music is so cute!  I truly find myself singing the opening song with him&#8230;always! It is nice for our children to have shows that are fun, as well as educational.",1397520000,2014-04-15

3.0,"I understand they don't to fall into a pit with the leads hooking up, but making it feel like they are mismatched was hard to watch.

3.0,"""Without you we are going to die. I don't know where I am, we don't speak Spanish."" Three friends travel to South America for a fun and relaxing vacation. One night while out at a club they met a group of women and begin to pair off. What starts out as a fun and promising night takes a terrifying turn when they are involved in an earthquake. Things then start to get worse and worse for the group. This surprisingly is a movie that I didn't really expect anything from. When the biggest name in the movie is Eli Roth, as an actor not a director, there really isn't much hope for goodness. While I can't say the movie is good it was entertaining and found myself having a good time watching it. The best way to describe this is that the whole movie has the feel of the beginning of Hostel or Turistas. Showing the friends having fun in a foreign country and not realizing the horror that is coming. Unlike those movies though there is no cutting people up, but if you like those two movies then this one is for you. Nothing else to say really, pretty generic but it is entertaining at least. Overall, this was better then expected but still very generic. I give it a B-.",1372377600,2013-06-28

5.0,"This is by far the best season ever, in my opinion. A lot of folks aren't crazy about it because it does lack the goriness of previous episodes, but I love how the story line is deepening and there is greater character build up of the Governor. Made the mid-season finale a total total sit on the edge of seat shocker. Not going to give anything away!  Please watch the first three seasons first so you can understand how all of this comes into play. Lots of references that you need to understand.",1389312000,2014-01-10

5.0,"""Life Itself"" is a celebration of movies and a man who devoted his life to sharing his insight and passion for moving pictures. It's a movie filled with humor and quite a bit of sadness and bittersweetness. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer and had spent more time on Ebert's interactions with filmmakers, debates with Siskel, interviews conducted by Ebert, etc. It would have been nice to see some footage of the film seminars he conducted in Boulder in which he would analyze a classic film almost frame by frame.The film spends a lot of time on his illness/dying, and while I understand this is important stuff, I found it, mostly for personal reasons, close to unbearable. I've been through some recent family deaths and it was hitting too close to home. I wanted more movies and less tragedy. I did find Ebert's Buddha-like approach to death quite moving.I met Roger Ebert once. It was in New York City during the early 80s shortly after he and Gene Siskel had done a special edition of their show highly critical of slasher flicks in which young people always seem to get horribly killed during or just after sex. I asked him how he, the screenwriter of Russ Meyer's very gory ""Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls,"" could possibly pan a genre of film making that he had been a contributor to. What was the difference between his bloody exploitation flick and the ones he was condemning? His response was short and sweet. ""The difference? Mine was good.""",1404518400,2014-07-05

Almost every single character in this show is believable, interesting, portrays their storyline with flair and conviction - and so far I haven't found an episode that bored me. Truly a great show that I hope will continue along the same formula and not do what happened to Mad Men by pandering to the lowest form of &#34;entertainment&#34;.",1388102400,2013-12-27

5.0,"This too was an accidental discovery and are we glad we found it! We have watched all of Season 1 and most of Season 2 and have found the shows to be refreshing in their originality and creativity. All too often shows seem to be cookie cutter, change the names and locations and apply the template story. You'll find none of that here and that alone has been a source of pleasure as we watched these gems.The stories are set in rural Wyoming and the lead, Sheriff Walt Longmire, played to perfection by Robert Taylor, seems so natural in the role that one feels one is there watching it happen.All of the other cast members do outstanding jobs that help maintain the feelings of authenticity created by Robert Taylor. If you like a well written, well produced, well acted detective mystery then you'll definitely want to put these shows on your must see list, they are really treasures!",1403136000,2014-06-19

4.0,A bit better than the first and something of a treat for the graphic novel fans. Like most Marvel movies it's easy to get lost in the action over the story and characters but this one does a better job. A lot of fun but far from perfect for film snobs.

I fear that they are writting themselves off a cliff because every episode this season main focus is red john.They are not really focused on patrick jane's crime fighting skills.

I fear that I'm going to have to start watching castle if they don't sh**t or get off the pot with this red john thing! Kill him already or kill the show! It has to be one or the other because as much as I love the mentalist, I am getting real tired of watching it! It's almost as bad as the alien angle on the x-files!

3.0,Bebe Neuwirth is the only known actor in this production.  Four interns from different backgrounds come to work at the same company owned (?)by Neuwirth.  She is a harsh manager who enjoys punishing her employees with the fear of being fired held over them.  The gimmick employed for this show is that the principles break into song (as in a Broadway Musical) to express their feelings.  The pilot failed to grab my attention but did hint at the possibilities by not trying to imitate either the flash of Glee or the spectacle of Smash (both of which I think are far too overwhelming).,1366934400,2013-04-26
2.0,"Roy looks like a mountain man.  He's earned a bunch of patents, but his property in the Redwoods has all kinds of beat up cars on it.  He's accrued 20 MILLION in local fees.  Now clearly no one would be able to pay that.  ""Hoarders"" tries to clear his cars and their equipment gets stuck in the mud!  If this guy is such the genius, why doesn't he have a lab, rather than a heap of junk!?  The show never says if his hoarding hurt the redwoods or was in some way anti-green.Now Loretta was a trip!  She looked like Marla Gibbs on crack!  She was pregnant and the show concludes by saying she had a healthy baby girl.  Still, I'm seriously worried that the mother's nuttiness may hurt the child eventually.  Loretta didn't wanna throw away nothin'!  It was funny, and exhilarating, to see her sistah-gurl relative snap on her and walk off in disgust.  Her husband stood by her side, regardless.  He must have loved her strong, or just had extreme passive tendencies.  Many of the non-hoarding husbands on this show threaten to leave, but this guy never once indicates that he'd abandon his nutty wife.  Good for him, well, in a way!",1313798400,2011-08-20

The show is a monster hit and it's engaging. I missed the second episode and therefore had to go back and watch it on amazon.com video. THis is a good show for mystery fans and for fans of sherlock holmes. IN this version sherlock is not a sociopath like in the bbc modern version 'sherlock' , he's a guy struggling with addiction and such.

Even the first episode of the season is called &#34;The New Rachel.&#34;  The repeat of shy girl, mean cheerleader, jock, outcast, gay guy, etc, is getting old. Where is the creativity? I watched every episode of previous seasons but found myself having a ho-hum attitude about these, often going weeks without bothering to watch. Unless their audience evolves as quickly as kids go through high-school, I anticipate this show will fizzle out after season 6, which Fox has confirmed renewal for.I do love the positive story lines, the way tough issues are addressed, and the generation of conversation that comes with the show. For that, I bumped it from 3 to 4 stars.",1371600000,2013-06-19

Who hasn't heard the creepy stories about the Jersey Devil, Lizard Man, Grassman, the Beast of Bray Road, Momo or the Dover Demon? Alien abductions and zombie soldiers (!) are also featured, together with the somewhat contentious flying humanoids. Perhaps too far out for the most conventional cryptozoologists, but a good overview of what people are *actually* seeing out there&#8230; Or &#34;out there&#34;, if you get my pun! ;-)",1393027200,2014-02-22

Nothing is wrong with it in terms of production values and the acting works. The 2 create chemistry and are believable. Its a creature feature and many of the more recent ones I've seen don't work for me but this one capture the primal and raw energy these types of flicks should have. Plus, the conflict between the 2 protagonists is gradually revealed in flashbacks, which keeps the pace moving along nicely.

Perhaps that's why this show has such a following: many brainy types find themselves torn between wanting to fit into the human race, and having little interest in being ordinary.  I teach at the university level, so I see this basic pattern play out among my colleagues every working day.Leonard has fallen for Penny, the pretty aspiring actress living across the hall.  Sheldon has a very narrow range of interests, in which he continually tries to improve himself, but little concern for anything outside his comfort zone.  Leonard would love to shut off the ideas constantly whizzing around his brain.  Sheldon would love to shut off the world and retreat into those ideas for the rest of his life.  Neither one can have what he wants.These brainiacs attract a huge audience, I contend, because real-life brainy types have both these paradigms at play simultaneously.  I'd love, like Sheldon, to care nothing for sex or approval, and just do what fulfills me.  But I'd also love, like Leonard, to reach outside myself and join the human race as an equal.  Sadly, I can do neither.  So I, and studious geeks worldwide, will sit back and watch these nerds fight that battle for me.",1305504000,2011-05-16
5.0,"I am amazed at the ratings decline from Season 1 & 2.  For fantasy fans, this is an awesome show.  From the stories crafted amongst the various characters as how they are in the present, but their histories in rich detailed background stories of how they came to be the way they are, leading to a greater sympathy, especially for the villains.  For children and adults, Henry's (the adopted son of one character and the biological son of two other characters) acting is superb and draws us in as the catalyst for unexpected changes.  So many of the sets and costumes are dazzling and clearly no expense was spared.  The CGI is great for a TV series.  If you have missed any of the seasons or episodes, I highly encourage you to retrieve them.  Last year I obtained both the Amazon Instant Video and the Blu-ray versions of this series.  This year, money is tight, so for now I'll live without the Blu-ray.  If you missed the first commercial on the 5-5-13, it is hilarious.  At any rate, this is a show that can be loved by the whole family.  WATCH IT!!",1367884800,2013-05-07

4.0,"This one could be an acquired taste of all the Amazon pilots but one worth nurturing.A story about a shambolic, dysfunctional but loving Jewish family in Los Angeles, the direction by writer Jill Solloway captures the lived-in feel of a family whose members are used to each other's company, with interruptions, overlapping dialogue and utterly convincing nuances.The characters are invariably self-obsessed, smart, deeply flawed but achingly human, and we're invited to be part of their world from the beginning. This has the feel of one of the edgier entries you might find at the Sundance Film Festival or HBO, but without the sense of anger or bitterness often found in HBO comedies.  That's not to say the story won't have its fair share of chaos and dark comedy or pathos.One of the pilots that justify its own existence. Well worth watching and continuing.",1391817600,2014-02-08
4.0,"Fans of ""Fringe"" saw the main storyline wrapped up in season four but there were still numerous loose ends and the fifth season gave showrunner Josh Wyman the chance to tie those up(for the most part). Given a shorter season (the magic 100 episodes reached for syndication with the 13 for season five) and a smaller budget, the fifth season examined many of the themes from the prior seasons and closed things off in an uneven but largely satisfying conclusion.SPOILERS:Season five functions almost as a reboot for the series in many respects as it takes place 21 years from 2015. The Fringe team (Olivia, Peter, Walter and Astrid) were ambered and are revived by their daughter to help fight The Observers. It seems that they weren't as beign as believed; September and his 11 other cohorts were scouting our time for an invasion from their time as their world has been so badly depleted of resources, it is dying.The Fringe team must put together the pieces of a puzzle existing in Walter's brain as he came up with a plan to defeat The Observers but can't recall it due to an interrogation that damages his memory.END OF SPOILERS:The fifth season for ""Fringe"" was a bit uneven with episodes that felt like filler episodes but the best ones hold their own with some of the best of seasons one through four. Although the production values weren't quite as strong for season five, the fifth season still had marvelous performances from the cast.Although there are numerous plot holes left by this season (I can't reveal them because to do so would provide too many spoilers), Wyman and his team of writers/directors do a good job of providing an emotionally satisfying conclusion to the show.The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a sharp looking transfer that provides lots of detail (you can even see light acne on the face of one actor in one sequence). The cool look of the show is nicely captured on the blu-ray discs.The 5.1 lossless audio sounds marvelous with nice use of surround effects. We get subtitles in English, Spanish and French.The special features include a single commentary track for ""Black Blotter"" featuring writer/producer J.H. Wyman and editor Jon Dudkowski. Every season of ""Fringe"" had an unusual, experimental episode and this is the one. It's a terrific one particularly with its unusual salute to Terry Gilliam and Monty Python.""A Farewell to Fringe"" features the cast, J.J. Abrams, J.H. Wyman and others in past and present interviews discussing the series. This runs about 20 minutes and is nicely complimented by the Comic Con panel on the series done just before season five premiered. It features the primary cast members (minus Blair Brown)discussing their favorite moments, the character development and answering a couple of questions posed by the audience.We also get a couple of deleted scenes as well as the gag reel all presented in HD. As a nice touch we also get a copy of the final script on the disc which you can read. It might have been nice incorporating it as an interactive feature with the final episode but I'm not complaining too much; Warner could have given usnothing in the way of special features.The three disc set also includes an episode guide and the package is housed in a cardboard slipcase.Although the final season was a bit short and some of the episodes were uneven, the final season was an emotionally satsifying one even if the show was quite a bit different from the preceding four.",1368230400,2013-05-11

5.0,"JT is one the strongest players to play Survivor. Stephen is one of the smartest to ever play the game. These 2 paired up makes up one of the greatest duos in survivor history. Coach is an obnoxious player who thinks he knows everything and is a big joke. This is his first appearance out of his 3 times playing and is one of a kind. Eddie George's wife Taj is in this game and probably would be voted out early but she finds something that helps her stay in the game. Tocantins is probably the worst location Survivor could ever choose. The island setting is more fitting for survivor and Africa is a good switch up because of the wildlife. There really isn't anything good about the Brazilian highlands. Exile island is a big sand dune and 2 people from opposite tribes get an opportunity to form an alliance. I didn't like Tyson at first, but he grew on me and I realized he's great at challenges and he can have a really tight knit alliance. Give Tyson a chance and he will win you over.

5.0,"The movie opens in Oct.21, 1994 in classic horror/slasher style. The killer has an unhealthy ""Ring"" like connection to his TV. He also has a hand held camera to film his killings. The film is grainy, a woman is screaming, there is blood, and a dog is barking. Good horror stuff. By the time it is all over, cops show up and everyone is dead. The opening includes a great leaping stab.In today's time Julian (Johnny Pacar) is making a movie of the event as a class project. He also seeks some stock footage from the local news station. In this horror film we are given the gratuitous nude shots of the young girls as they are being secretly filmed by Quinn (Toby Hemingway) the teen who works at the news station. Quinn in turn sells these thumb drive films to a local admirer (policeman Christian Slater) of the female form. As expected the ""Ring"" aspect we saw earlier enters the film.I liked the discussion of the ""hand-held"" camera technique. The maker of the film claims it gives the movie ""energy"" while the viewer describes it as giving him ""a headache."" Toby Hemingway plays a good moody psychotic teen.

4.0,"`The Burning Plain' tells the dark and dangerous story of a young woman named Sylvia, who is battling memories of a tragic incident that took place while she was a teen.  This story, told in four parts, is rich with character development and pure insight on the process of pain, and forgiveness.  While those stories can at times become a tad confusing (bouncing from teen love, an adulterous affair, a clinically depressed woman and then a father/daughter accident storyline can get a little too garbled for its own good) they truly work out a beautifully told story in the end, one that highlights the tragic aftermath of poor decisions and the cooling power of atonement.  The film is also packed with marvelous performances.  Charlize Theron, Kim Basinger and Jennifer Lawrence are all spectacular.  Theron attacks her character's growing pain with sharp rawness.  Basinger trembles with aching realism as she contemplates her actions and Lawrence, far more natural and organic here than in her Oscar nominated role in `Winter's Bone', is a marvelous portrait of teen misunderstanding.  The story is heartbreaking and yet, that final frame encapsulates all the hope needed to give a more tender and realistic `happy-ending'.  And that score is just superb!",1323388800,2011-12-09

5.0,"There's no doubt `The Glades' compares to `Midsomer Murders.' Skilled copper, multiple crimes, additional plots, romantic moments, and comedy also in the mix. The Glades takes place in Palm Glades, a fictitious small town Florida (somewhere near the Everglades), while Midsomer is rural English villages. Glades storylines take into account Florida history, out-of-the-way settings, habitats, politics, animal life, ethnic diversity, and of courts FL-style murder. Also expect many bathing beauties--it's Florida. Like Midsomer, Glade makes use of MANY guest stars, too numerous to mention. Includes contemporary music worked into the story. Murder solving is by the episode but other relationship plots are ongoing from the beginning pilot in Season 1 through this set of stories.Returning: Jim Longworth (Matt Passmore, an Aussie using American accent recognized only by bonus material in Series 1 DVD) is a top crime solver, but knows it and up-talks everyone from his boss to his partner. Capable of his own quick funny jabs, forensic med. examiner Carlos (Carlos Gomez-a real Cuban/American playing one in a super performance) is an extra smart Dr. while FDLE boss Colleen (Michelle Hurd-who began in the pilot as a barmaid, is stunning as well as in charge). Tough and hot, as quick-witted as Longworth, Callie (Kiele Sanchez) is a nurse with a kid Jeff (Uriah Shelton) and jailbird husband Ray (Clyne Crawford) but he's about to be released for narking aid, and Callie will soon gain new employment. The new employment only adds to the romantic conflict for her and Longworth, sometimes generating spontaneous frivolity. The great regulars must include Daniel (Jordan Wall-FL local actor making it big in this series) intern who's funny, quick, smart, and a good bit of a computer nerd.Episodes for season 2 (SUBTITLED)1 FAMILY MATTERS-2 OLD GHOSTS-3 LOST AND FOUND- `new' forensic nurse introduced4 MOONLIGHTING-5 LITTLE DIRTY SECRETS-6 GIBTOWN- a town of the strange and bizarre7 ADDICTED TO LOVE-8 SECOND SKIN-9 IRON PIPELINE-10 SWAMP THING-Can the success continue to Season 3? Surely! Midsomer (look it up, it's fantastic) began in 1997 and continues non-stop. Two great murder series to own.

Chill, unease, and creepiness can be experienced in this series, but erroneous conclusions (unrequited love, tragic-death apparitions, spirits looking for the Light) are often unjustifiably forthcoming, which makes many of the stories seem forced.  This series, as most in the genre, seems unwilling to focus on the malevolent and gratuitous hate behind most, if not all, manifestations and opts out for the charming and quaint explanations behind a haunting. Sometimes &#34;Aunt Rita&#34; is just not your Aunt Rita.  All this said, it's still a fun and safe way to spend the better part of an hour exploring what goes bump in the night.

4.0,"This documentary traces the history of digital video and weighs out all of it's pros and cons.

4.0,"While its combination of almost surreal humor and real emotion can sometimes be... well... awkward, this is still among thebetter and more honest series about teenagers I've seen.I'm a male over 50, so I'm certainly not the target audience for this MTV show about a blogging 15 year old girl dealing withthe confusions and absurdities of sex, love, high school social politics, and well meaning but humorously dysfunctional parentsand guidance counselors.But after friends recommended it I started watching and found I appreciated it's frankness, quirky characters and good natured humor.I also liked how it dealt with issues like sex and drinking as simply a part of teenage life, neither preaching morality (kids have sex andno one gets pregnant, they know to wear condoms, and they do sometimes get their hearts broken) nor striving to shock.The acting is all over the place, often cartoony, and a number of characters are little more than comic clich&eacute;s, but as the the show goesalong a surprising number of them reveal new sides and new depth.  If not quite great, Awkward season 1 is quite good and very easyto enjoy... if you don't mind bringing back some of your own awkward memories as you realize the teen years really aren't so different now.",1352505600,2012-11-10
2.0,"Interesting idea, not the first time that it's been tried before. I liked ""Commander in Chief,"" the short-lived series about a woman president, better, because it didn't try so hard to play off real people. Sorry to be the lone dissenter, it seems, and this will undoubtedly sound trivial and sexist (and probably is), but:I was offended by the absurdly high and ugly waistbands they dressed Sigourney Weaver in to hide her thick middle-aged waist. They didn't do that to the men with their middle-aged paunches.It amazes me that whoever cast this thought anyone would think that Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is sexy enough to appeal to so many women (he's very unattractive, to me, and what's with that mouth downturned mouth that's apparently an affectation?) or that someone as attractive as Susan Berg, who played the reporter, would find whoever it was who played the editor she worked for attractive in the least (definitely not). And surely they could have found a lot of men to portray the character based on Bill Clinton better and something more substantive for the character to be than such a pathetic sex and power monger.Most of the plots were just silly, not developed, way too contrived.Sigourney Weaver was fine in the part and in her acting as Secretary of State and would-be President. And I liked Ellen Burnstyn and her portrayal of the sniper-witted, functional alcoholic mother of the Secretary of State (do you see a problem there?). But I found some of actors, much of the acting, and most of the dialog (writing) insulting to anyone with average intelligence. An embarrassment, basically.",1347926400,2012-09-18

4.0,"The film starts out as a great psychological thriller. Cara Harding (Julianne Moore) is a psychologist like her father (Jeffrey DeMunn). She does not believe in multiple personalities. Her dad finds a case in David/Adam (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) that challenges her. She investigates the lives they claim to be, only to discover the impossible.What was unfortunate was that this film moves from a clever thriller to a less than stellar horror film. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of the film. Cara's attempts to prove Dave/Adam as a hoax, blowing up in her face, time and time again was great. Too bad they couldn't wrap it up. Still it is well worth a view.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1374537600,2013-07-23

4.0,"The Fox series Prison Break debuted in 2005 and had a first season that was intelligently written, intelligently executed, and endlessly exciting. The series miraculously had two more seasons (with season three being cut short due to the writer's strike) and Fox announced the fourth season would be the final season. I absolutely love this show, but the idea to end it was a good one. Prison Break was a one-season concept that made two seasons work but just got more and more ludicrous as it went on, while never failing to be entertaining. With that said, the fourth season is very entertaining. It's this season that the writer's throw all logic out the window. Character's who were dead return, character's who were forgotten come out of nowhere; the writer's of this season seem to have had one rule for writing; if it can go wrong (no matter how implausible), make sure it does.We've followed these character's as they escaped from prison (season one), ran from the law (season 2), and had to escape from another prison (season 3). In season 4, they have to break in to a building. Sounds interesting, right?Everyone has escaped from Sona, the prison in Panama that housed the characters for the third season. Now in Los Angeles, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), his brother Lincoln Burroughs (Dominic Purcell), girlfriend Sarah Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), Brad Bellick (Wade Williams), and former FBI-agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) are recruited by Homeland Security agent Don Self (Michael Rappaport) for a top-secret operation to help take down The Company for good. With an offer of immunity for everyone on the table, the group agrees to help Self retrieve Scylla, the Company's little black book.All of the characters are back, including everybody's favorite villain T-Bag (Robert Knepper), who (as usual) has a different agenda than the rest of the group. Also, in a much larger role, is Leon Russom as General Jonathan Krantz, but more on that in a moment.Season four will have you shaking your head several times throughout simply because of how completely ridiculous many of the plot twists are, but it ranks high on the excitement scale. As for how it ends...Well, those who have followed this show and these characters for years will be divided, but how else could they have ended it? The ending works, but could have been executed a little better.Now, on another note...I'm not the first person to complain about the weak, anything goes-style of writing on Prison Break, but I wish to mention that the writer's never failed to write strong main characters. It's hard to deny this is a show with strong characterization that has a knack for establishing characters for us to care about and establishing characters for us to hate only to trick us into liking them later. But, I will not let the actors escape without credit.Prison Break, during its run, was never honored for the actor's it had on its show. One doesn't have to even watch this show very long to see that this was a shame. Wentworth Miller, for example, is the only person I can see as Scofield. He's quietly menacing, committed, and charismatic...Not to say he doesn't overdo it sometimes, but he balances the tough and emotional in a way most actors would not. If one denies the range of Wade Williams as Bellick, watch all four seasons of this show and tell me how Bellick goes from one of the most unlikeable characters on the show to a very sympathetic one in such a short span of time. Even Purcell, who never had to do much in the series besides look tough and be intimidating when needed, embodies Burroughs. That description of his acting is pretty much all the character needs to do, so it all fits. Finally, we have Robert Knepper whose performance as T-Bag only got better with each season. If this had been a theatrical film as opposed to a TV series, Knepper would have received an Oscar nomination. If not for fan-reaction to Knepper's portrayal of the devious, depraved T-Bag he likely would've been killed off at the end of season one. Knepper takes a relatively simple character and just molds him into one of the most memorable characters I've ever seen on a television series. It's no easy task to take a character that frequently betrays and hurts the character's you care about and make him likeable and every moment Knepper is onscreen, he'll keep your attention focused there. Finally, Russom as the General has a very menacing look coupled with a deep, foreboding voice...He makes a great antagonist for Scofield's gang. All of the other actor's are great too, but this has already taken up a large majority of my review.There's not much to write about the fourth season of a television show. If you're reading this, you've likely seen the previous three seasons or you've already seen all four. If you're a fan, this season is definitely worth checking out if only to see the last hurrah of these character's you've watched for so long. While Prison Break lost some IQ points along the way, it never lost its ability to keep your heart racing and keep your affection for its main set of characters. With that said, if you're a fan of the series...This is essential.GRADE: B",1257724800,2009-11-09
4.0,"Controversial as this film already is (the critics hate it, those who have watched it either hate or love it), it is a solid stretch of cinematic art by writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn. He is an artist who challenges audiences and takes enormous risks: his 1996 film, the extremely violent and uncompromising PUSHER became a cult phenomenon and won Refn instant international critical acclaim. That was followed by BLEEDER and the now cult classic DRIVE. Each of these films is highly stylized and focuses on introverted reactions to outward situations. ONLY GOD FORGIVES pushes those traits even further: completely set in Thailand it weighs in on Asian symbolism, spiritualism and response to revenge or own hand rights. It is very dark, both in the cinematography of Larry Smith and in the ever-present veneer of killing and death and mutilation. The entire film is a study in color manipulation, slow movement (as in Noh theater), minimal dialog, and even more minimal character development. And yet somehow Refn makes all of this work to his advantage to hold the audience, as though imprisoned, to examine the extents of evil.The setting is Bangkok. Ten years ago Julian (Ryan Gosling) killed a man and went on the run. Now he manages a Thai boxing club as a front for a drugs operation. Respected in the criminal underworld, deep inside, he feels empty. When Julian's brother Billy (Tom Burke) murders an underage prostitute, the police call on retired cop Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) - the Angel of Vengeance whose other obsession is Karaoke singing. Chang allows the father to kill his daughter's murderer, then 'restores order' by chopping off the man's right hand. Julian's mother Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas) - the foul-mouthed nasty head of a powerful criminal organization - arrives in Bangkok to collect her favorite first son's body. She charges Julian to find his killers and 'raise hell'. Despite being beaten severely in a fight with Chang, Julian's inability to react to anything - even to the physical relationship with a strange girl Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam) - leads to mayhem that in many ways does not even seem to affect him.The casting is strange: obviously Ryan Gosling was hired for the role of Julian because of his works with Reyn in DRIVE. He is called upon to do very little and as a result we are not able to appreciate his motivation or his presence in the story.  Kristin Scott Thomas is a brilliant actress but here she is merely a source of filthy accusations and Kabuki-like poses. The star of the film is Vithaya Pansringarm, and even though we loathe him and his malicious manner he alone gives us an idea of why he is doing what he is doing, framing it all with obnoxious Karaoke singing in a garish nightclub.  Everything about the film is slow and dark and yet for some obscure reason it works.  Grady Harp, July 13",1374278400,2013-07-20
2.0,"I'm old enough to remember the old ironside and I LOVE Blair Underwood, so I thought that this would be a great series. I can't honestly even begin to wonder what they were thinking when they wrote the script. Horrible at best. I'll let you decide.

4.0,"i think of this kind of thing as similar to SPINAL TAP, which was a mockumentary of a documentary on rock stars.  This is a mock version of a soap opera like tv miniseries.  If you like this kind of thing, it will be five stars for you.  if you can handle this only a great once and awhile, like i can, then it will be less. I guess more apt would be the mock soap opera from decades ago called SOAP. For the first year or two that satire was out of this world. What mainly sustained me though was the late Robert Mulligan as one of the players. This is also similar to the spoof on SNL about the &#34;Californians&#34; which is also ok every once in awhile.  It is not that I cannot see the talent in this.  I can but I just personally can't make it through all these episodes of a satire of a family saga. this review is written primarily for others like me, who can see the talent in it but it just isn't their kind of entertainment. SPINAL TAP and SOAP were about it for me in this genre of entertainment.",1390608000,2014-01-25
3.0,"The low budget horror indie ""Almost Human"" is not a movie that should be oversold.  When I picked up the Blu-ray with the requisite rave reviews (from Bloody Disgusting and Shock Til You Drop), I thought I might have found a small gem.  Truthfully, though, I think I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more discovering it on my own without preconceived notions.  This little movie borrows elements from a seventies slasher film and combines them with an alien abduction theme and throws in some classic Body Snatcher moments for good effect.  The idea, itself, works terrifically well but I'm not sure the film was always as clever or as original as I might have hoped.  After an intriguing beginning, my interest in the movie really started to wane.  The body of the movie really lacks mystery or surprises, it's just a rampant killing spree (in which a larger dose of humor would have helped immeasurably).  It isn't until the final confrontations, though, that the movie truly came alive.  A couple of wacky moments (alien mating) really enliven matters and caused me to add an extra star to my rating.Slight Spoilers (but nothing that would surprise you if you read the Blu-ray/DVD cover):As I said, I quite liked how ""Almost Human"" began right in the thick of the action.  We meet Seth Hampton (Graham Skipper) as he is driving as if the devil himself is chasing him.  When he arrives at the home of his good friend Mark (Josh Ethier), he spins a harrowing tale of abduction and pursuit.  Before Mark can truly comprehend what's happening, electrical disturbances and a mysterious blue light come to visit.  And before you can say boo, Mark becomes one of the missing.  What happened?  If you expect a mystery to unfold, the screenplay takes us in an alternate direction.  Years fast forward, and Seth is haunted by what happened.  He starts to have strange premonitions about Mark and he tracks down Mark's old girlfriend (Venessa Leigh) to share his concerns.  Mark, meanwhile, has returned (in some form or another) and is making his way back home leaving an escalating body count in his wake.  All of this is so matter-of-fact.  The murders aren't a mystery, what happened to Mark is not really important, and the killing sequences lack imagination.End Slight Spoilers.I will say this, however, writer/director Joe Begos clearly loves this genre of filmmaking.  You could sense his enthusiasm for the subject and how much respect he wanted to show it.  Therefore, when the final act rolls around, I'm pleased to say that the fun quotient goes up quite a bit.  When the three central characters square off, a number of moments made me laugh out loud.  It's fast paced and amusing, I just wish the rest of the movie had been so energetic.  This being a low budget endeavor, the effects aren't elaborate but they are effective enough.  And although none of the actors will win any awards (except maybe a diner waitress who is truly awful in her one line), they handle the action moments well.  I especially liked Skipper.  In the end, ""Almost Human"" is a pleasant enough experience with modest expectations.  It's not a new horror classic, but it has a nice payoff in its ending.  KGHarris, 6/14.",1402963200,2014-06-17
1.0,"I saw the reviews on here and read some internet posts about how great this show was, so I bought it. I'd seen a clip of the show on the internet and thought it was interesting, but the lead just gave me bad vibes. Watching the first three episodes last night, I just couldn't take it anymore! Callie, his love interest, is totally annoying. She is a nurse who also goes to medical school and has a son. Jim is a know-it-all punk who always magically has the upper hand. There is no explanation at all for why or how he outsmarts everyone, he just does. The characters is very smug and unlikeable. Maybe he appeals to narcissistic Generation X and Y types, but not me. Furthermore, Jim doesn't have any depth. He is in jerk mode all of the time. He's not even vulnerable. This is the worst written show on TV!The character is just not believable as a cop. He acts like a rich prep schooler. I believe that he is supposed to be middle-class, but the writers probably can't even comprehend how to create a middle-class character, so they based one off of their own privileged lives. It's almost like they couldn't stand writing Callie as just a nurse, so they made her a nurse who is trying to be a doctor! Now she's classy enough for the show!I got bored during episodes. The shows I watched began with a murder, then just became disjointed as time went on. Jim would investigate, meet up with Callie, make sarcastic comments, then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly. The Carlos Gomez character is the only interesting one that comes across as human, but even he has no chemistry with the lead.I just couldn't stand the show anymore and I put it up for sale. I really don't recommend it.",1314144000,2011-08-24

4.0,"Heroes season 2 I think was pretty good considering that they cut it down due to that uselesss writer's strike. I mean the strike was useless, not the writers themselves. It left us with nothing but crappy reality shows through-out most of the year. Heroes season 2 told as good of a story as it could've due to the short time. It does start out a bit better than it ends though. Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka) still steals the show. Him in the past where he meets his childhood hero Takezo Kensei (an excellent David Anders of Alias) led to some of the more engaging stuff of the season. Parkman (Greg Grunberg) finding out that his father is infact Molly's nightmareman was a little disappointing I admit. However the nightmare scenes were done well enough that I didn't care after awhile. I just wish that their was more of him since he was one of the fresher things about this season. He also was a little creepy.Speaking of creepy, Sylar (Zachary Quinto) is back but powerless. He shows that he's dangerous even without his powers though. He meets a woman with a dangerous power that kills everyone around her when her eyes turn black and bleed. She's a good person but her powers kill people and only her brother's power can control her power if that makes sense. Sylar gets in her head and makes her think that he's a good person that wants to help her. When he's really just fascinated by her power and wants it for himself. Well when he gets his back that is and he thinks Mohinder (Sendhil Ramamurthy) can help him get them back.While Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) mysteriously lost his memory and doesn't remember his brother Nathan or even having powers. He falls for a women who's brother says he can help him remmember. He wants him to use his powers for bad though before he'll help him. While Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman) moves his daughter Claire (Hayden Panettiere) somewhere to protect her from the company. He tells her to stay low. That's easier said than done when a kid there sees that she has powers. It's ok with him though since he can...fly.I was entertained by the season. It has many twists and turns. Does it all lead up to something great though in the end ? No, I can't really say that. Instead of NY being threatened by a bomb it's now threatened by a virus. While instead of Hiro seeing the future and seeing that NY is doomed, Peter does instead. So they could've been more original, it was too familiar to what we already seen in season 1. While Ali Larter has shown she can act as Nikki, she's wasted in this season with little to do.It also bugged me that some new heroes have powers that we have already seen. Such as, one can fly ""like Nathan"", while another can heal ""like Claire"". However those were probably my only problems with the season. Other than that they did what they could due to the strike and it could have been worse.",1214784000,2008-06-30

And the pacing seemed a bit slow.But having said that, I think the show has great potential and am really interested in having this pilot made into a series.

4.0,"First off let's get something straight right out of the gate--I like and will watch anything Eric McCormack is in, no matter what the material is. The rest of the cast is exceptional for this show as well although I admit at first I rolled my eyes a bit at Rachel Leigh Cook being cast as an FBI agent since my initial impression was that she's just a little too young and fresh-faced to be taken seriously in that role. However, she does such a good job of bringing her character to life that I soon set aside my skepticism and now can't imagine how anyone else could do the role.The plotline of the show is your traditional fish out of water protagonist helps law enforcement catch bad guys in a non-traditional manner. This is a very standard story line that has been done well in shows ranging from Medium to Monk, so in that regard there aren't any real surprises. We all know the protagonist will see things fully-trained law enforcement can't and through a combination of luck, special talents and even the occasional deus ex machina (plot device where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved through the intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object). However, this show takes a new original and yes fresh take on the template so to speak. To that end the plot of the TV show can be summed up as this: Chicago Professor Dr. Daniel Pierce (Eric McCormack) is a brilliant neuroscientist who has published four books and now teaches the subject at a local university. A former student of his, FBI Special Agent Kate Moretti, shows up one day telling Dr. Pierce that she's been reassigned to Chicago from D.C. after the higher ups there got annoyed that she tended to not necessarily follow orders. Anyways it turns out Dr. Pierce has acted as a consultant for law enforcement before and Kate enlists her former teacher's help in solving some of the more puzzling cases that she encounters. There is a catch to all of this however, Dr. Pierce is a labeled paranoid schizophrenic who manages his condition primarily with the help of his Boy Friday Teaching Assistant Max Lewicki and talks with his best friend and former love interest Natalie Vincent.Dr. Pierce is definitely a bit paranoid, highly suspicious of all things government and/or modern-living based including microwave meals, full body scans and any political figure including the ones he voted for as ""the lesser of two evils"". We learn that Dr. Pierce had a breakdown when he was still a college student, got diagnosed and became a neuroscientist thanks largely to his fascination with and desire to understand what was happening to him. A manifestation of his illness is that he sees people who aren't there--manifestations and/or hallucinations brought on as his mind grapples with a variety of mysteries and issues that he is struggling to help Agent Moretti resolve. This is the really fun part of this series since neither we or Dr. Pierce always know who is real and who isn't although after you've watched a few episodes you can sort of guess who is a hallucination, especially when it's a historical figure like Joan of Arc or JFK. Nonetheless watching Eric McCormack play someone who knows he's seriously flawed, who himself isn't always sure of what's real or not,  brings a surprisingly touching performance to those in our society who find themselves on the outskirts of ""normal"" society often shunned and feared even when they have done nothing wrong.Dr. Pierce isn't a particularly brave man either, put him in a room where a surprise party is being held and he freezes like a deer caught in headlights and begins franticly searching for a way out of the room. He often clutches a satchel to his chest when he's feeling especially insecure and when things get too overwhelming he retreats to playing classical music on an old casette player and headphones while he air conducts the music to soothe himself and block out noise or situations. He knows he's weird, we know he's weird, the world knows he's weird, but he manages. And truthfully he'd be utterly useless in his work with the FBI or as a teacher except for one thing--when a puzzle is placed before him or he can teach someone something the man simply comes to life. And does so in a way that is so real it makes me wonder who Eric McCormack has hung out with to get his role right. We all know that one person who's an oddball or just a bit mentally not there, but if you put the thing they love most in front of them they change so quickly that you wonder if it's even the same person.The show also shows us something about those who society deems mentally ill--that no matter how far off the grid someone may have appeared to fall they can still be a useful citizen and they are our fellow man. Many of the characters in the show are also, like Dr. Pierce, deemed mentally ill or flawed in some way. Add to that the constant commentary and plots involving today's latest scandals and human rights issues and you have a very compelling TV show for those who like their entertainment to be a bit more intelligent than average and who love their heroes to be flawed, real human beings who still choose to do the right thing even when they know it's not really good for their life or state of mental health.My only complaint with the show, and why I took one star off, is that I don't feel it realistically shows the truth about the mental health industry or the people who work in it as a whole. Although Dr. Pierce occasionally makes a snide remark about primitive drugs or people being committed and/or drugged the show tends to portray mental health workers, psychiatrists and hospitals as benevolent places and people who all really do care about those needing their services. That's a nice fantasy that I happen to know from bitter experience with family and friends just isn't true. In the real world those who are unlucky enough to find themselves labeled mentally ill are sadly all too often exploited and treated the worst by the very people who are supposed to be helping them. When Dr. Pierce's psychiatrist in the hospital tells him she can't treat him as a patient, but offers to be his friend as a replacement for an imaginary one I rolled my eyes and shook my head. That just never would happen except for maybe an equally outcast therapist or psychiatrist. And again, I know from real-world experience that they are often just as ostracized and badly treated by their colleages and generally they tend to gravitate towards private practices rather than large hospitals where they are often fired or laid off at the first chance their bosses get.Is the series worth watching? Just for Eric McCormack's performance and the originality of the series I would say yes. I'll see what Season 2 brings though before I decide that mabye I just can't keep suspending disbelief over the portrayal of a mental health industry as being far more benevelont and helpful than it really is. And that would be a shame, becaause everything else about this series hits a perfect note with me outside of that.",1369612800,2013-05-27

5.0,"Although I&#8217;ve never, and probably will never go duck hunting, I loved this series.  Why, you might ask?  These sequences are created on a basic Founding Father concept:  Unity is Powerful.  In addition emphasis is placed on the first and original unity, the family.  Different as we all are even in our immediate family, we are major contributors to the success and accomplishments of this unit.  The family is we learn to cooperate for the common good.  Is this an easy task?  NO.  But it does work when it is practiced in all aspects of the family.  Great and needed lessons for our country!  Bob&#8217;s Girl",1396656000,2014-04-05

5.0,"I've been a fervent Stanley Kubrick fan since I saw ""A Clockwork Orange"" when I was sixteen.  Of all his films I must have seen ""Dr. Strangelove"" the most.  I saw ""The Shining"" on opening day in 1980 and loved it.  It was met with mixed critical and commercial reaction.  I remember having impassioned discussions with friends about the merits of the film with most of them partial to Stephen King's source novel.  It's with a little bemusement to me that with the passage of time the film has been re-evaluated with a loyal cult following.  What is it about this screen adaptation by the cinema's greatest artistic visionary of a pop horror novel that resonates with so many?  I don't know if director Rodney Ascher's film allays any of the questions but a lot of theories abound by the experts who provide their observations as snippets of ""The Shining"" are shown.  The most intriguing are the theories that Kubrick was making an allegorical film about the Holocaust or was transmitting cryptic messages about his role in faking the Apollo 11 moon landing.  What amused most was the elevation of a character, Bill Watson, who was barely in the film.  There is a lot of repetition from these theorists but at one hundred minutes the film doesn't overstay its welcome.  I would rate this film four stars but the supplements make this package indispensable notably a one hour symposium at a Kubrick film festival consisting of Kubrick aid Leon Vitali, film scholar Geoffrey Cocks, Mick Garris, the director of the TV remake of ""The Shining"", and Ascher.  The back and forth exchanges by this crew is funny and intriguing with Vitali offering the most hilarious input.  It is definitely a prerequisite to have seen ""The Shining"" to appreciate Ascher's film as well as Kubrick's repertoire.  This documentary serves as something of a parlor game for Stanleyphiles.  It's nonsense that Kubrick inserted subliminal advertising in ""The Shining"".  Now if you excuse me I have a hankering for some Chicken in a Biscuit.",1380844800,2013-10-04

Of course we have Glenn Close playing as a top notch, take no prisoners and ruthless attorney defending people that were swindled out of their pensions and savings from the corrupt boss played by Ted Danson.  Who also does a wonderful job is his role.  As does the new attorney played by Rose Byrne who starts out as a wide eyed, the world is wonderful person.  But by season end so many things will happen to her that will change not only her views.  But her very way of life as well.An excellent show and an well written and directed first season.

It's good if you are considered developmentally challenged. It's good if you just want a good laugh. The acting is turgid. The plot has some potential.

The soldiers are friendly and the helicopters belong to the evil Russians. Guess who wins without a scratch? So, yeah, pretty dumb and over acted.

After walking for awhile they find a cabin and decide to stay there until they can travel again. They are surprised when they find the 2 British pilots show up. Taking turns capturing each other they soon realize that the only way to survive is to work together. First of all I have to say that if you are expecting a war movie this is not what you are looking for. On the other hand it is a good movie and is worth seeing. I enjoy true stories anyway but this one really shows the humanity of people during wartime. There really isn't much more to this then 5 people in a cabin talking and it is a little slow but it is interesting enough to keep you watching and I enjoyed it.

Piano prodigy Eli Bloom (Jesse Eisenberg) is on his way to the most important audition of his life, but first he has to drop off his mother, Penny (Melissa Leo), at a drug rehab center.Since Penny is not quite high enough to be admitted, mother and son end up at the door of her dealer, Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan).  Since Penny is in debt and Sprinkles is low on product, Eli must play negotiator as the unlikely team hits the streets.  A series of comic misadventures ensues, perhaps too many to make the events even passably possible.

4.0,"One of the best things about DVDs, notably the release of TV series on DVD, is the fact that you actually get a chance to watch some of the best shows on TV that you may have missed the first time around. Such is the case with BIONIC WOMAN.This remake of the hit 70s show that starred Lindsey Wagner (that was a spin off of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN) updates the original, keeping only what's necessary. Jamie Sommers is young, in love and pregnant. After breaking the news to her boyfriend Will (Chris Bowers), the pair are broadsided on the way home.Damaged to the extent that she might die, Jamie is saved by Will as his true occupation is revealed. The man she thought was a simply college professor actually is a brilliant surgeon who works for a secret government agency. And rather than lose Jamie, Will takes her to their facility and enhances her.While her legs, one arm, one ear and one eye were completely obliterated, this facility replaces them with bionic parts, mechanical computerized parts as well as nano technology that boost her healing. Horrified at first, Jamie begins to accept the new her. When Will is killed by the last candidate for bionics, Sarah Corvus (Katee Sackhoff), Jamie joins the agency that rebuilt her.That's the simple set up for the series. Super strength, eyesight, hearing and more. Working for a government agency. And with a revenge motive strong enough to fill any number of stories. But the series doesn't stop there. As well as her new found life, Jamie has a kid sister to raise. Troublesome and a handful, the teen was dropped at her doorstep by her father and was the reason Jamie stayed where she is. A combination of love and loss revolve between the two.The series takes a natural progression, from Jamie being talked into her new career path to how she deals with Sarah. The series shows her progression, her training and her learning to deal with her abilities. But what makes this series work best is that it's not a straight out remake. Instead, it takes those bones from the original and makes the story it's own.Michelle Ryan stars as Jamie and does a fantastic job, showing a young woman who takes what life throws at her and survives. Miguel Ferrer does his smarmy best as the cold hearted bureaucrat who's in charge. Sackhoff is equally casts as the killer who wants to change but has technology that wasn't perfected within her.Cost of living what it is, there is no way Jamie can have been made for a mere $6 million. Times have changed and so has this show. But that's a good thing. While the original seems silly to look back on now, science fiction fans can find much to enjoy in this one. Look for it on your shelves or add it to your own. It's a series worth having.",1206403200,2008-03-25

5.0,"As I've said in all my reviews, I love the Stargate shows SG-1 and Atlantis, not so Universe.  I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great, but ran it's course and was in decline at the end.  It allowed some new characters, albeit with familiar personalities, along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program (in addition to all her guest appearances).  I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best.  I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1. A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys, but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show.  I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives, the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones.  I couldn't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively.  I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters, replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field.  The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows, but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost.  The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton.  I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning, but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships.  i know they added on, but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth, one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force.  It is part of what started to become a little to familiar, the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute.  Great for a show, or a movie, but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane.  I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times (waking the wraithe early, messing with the replicator programming, genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics.  How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we don't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power, to much danger.  But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their &#34;world&#34; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the &#34;world&#34; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots.  Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it, where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away.  Good, even great for periods, but limited from the start by being set in the present.  Great run while it lasted.",1398643200,2014-04-28

4.0,"Sherlock Holmes rises again, this time in the persona of Jonny Lee Miller, a self-centered, living off his father's trust fund morphine addict released/escaped from rehab and in the care of Ex-surgeon turned sour on a lost patient Dr Joan Watson (Lucy Liu).  Though it is difficult to evaluate where this takeoff is going, at the present episode we do get to appreciate the much-tattooed Miller and the always beautiful Liu banter back and forth, with Holmes performing his rather mind-boggling ability to read clues and people and Watson as his `guardian'.  The show has possibilities though it is difficult to reconfigure the droll, elegant original Holmes in the form of this always-on-the-verge-of-withdrawal fast-talking new image. One of the finer moments of the new episode, almost ruined by Holmes misbehavior, is a moment at the opera where opera singers Randal Turner and Melissa Zapin are performing Wagner's `Tristan und Isolde'.  Maybe there is hope that the series will progress down those lines of enlightenment. Grady Harp, September 12",1348963200,2012-09-30

3.0,"I bet this is the kind of show actors thumb-wrestle their agents to get into: a chance to play a different role in every episode.  Subtle writing, lurking secrets, and explosive action make even jaded viewers like me hang on.  I only wish the performances were on par with the background.  Then this merely good show could be great.Deep beneath Los Angeles, a shadowy organization uses advanced tech to reprogram human beings into whatever they need to be.  Working at once to evade the law and to get immensely rich, the Dollhouse promises the moon to anybody who can afford to pay.  What they can't promise is that they can control the implications.Series principal Eliza Dushku is an odd choice on which to hang an action drama.  The role was created for her, and it plays to her strengths, letting her be essentially vacant as the camera longingly admires her body and her fighting chops.  The show operates at its peak when the camera turns its gaze on the other actors.And what a supporting cast.  Harry Lennix, Olivia Williams, and Tamoh Penikett lead an ensemble through the kind of paces that must make Equity lawyers see dollar signs, from action to romance to comedy and back.  They are capable of so much, but the camera so loves Dushku that they get far too little face time.The story benefits from Joss Whedon's distinctive humor and eye for an off-kilter story.  But not every actor is up to Whedon's particular demands.  Fran Krantz in particular wants to overplay the humor, and winds up mugging for the camera, while Miracle Laurie, so good in the dramatic and romantic scenes, sucks laughter away like a comedy Hoover.Moreover, the show's political implication, that technology's force panders to human weakness, is good but overplayed.  At various points, different characters state the series thesis explicitly, apparently because the creators think we're too thick to put the pieces together.  Considering how subtle the story is, the moral should be equally restrained.This show will likely be remembered as one of TV's great ""Almost-Was"" moments.  Like Whedon's other lost classic, Firefly, people will talk about it in wishful tones, mourning all the missed potential.  I enjoy the show's smart intensity, but it should be so much better than it ultimately proves to be.",1268611200,2010-03-15

3.0,"Steven Moffat contributed some outstanding individual episodes to the rebooted Dr Who series back when Russell T Davis was lead writer and showrunner. Moffat also wrote a truly excellent transition episode, introducing the Matt Smith Doctor, that was far more convincing that any of RTD's transitions.But...As showrunner, Moffat has been something of a disappointment. It's not so much the over-ambitious story-arcs as the inability to manage emotions. Moffat's Doctor is too much the fast-moving slapstick clown without the pathos necessary to provide emotional depth. Worse yet is Moffat's addiction to The Great Reset Button In The Sky. In Moffat's universe loss is something to be avoided, so people keep dying (poor Rory in particular) over and over again and being brought back over and over again until frankly we don't care. Moffat doesn't seem able, as a writer, to grasp that without the possibility of loss there's no possibility of really engaging the audience's emotions. When we know it's all going to be yet another conjuring trick we get bored. Very seriously bored.So here, in the swan-song episode for Matt Smith's Doctor, we get the standard Moffat tropes. Worse, we get a cursory ""tie up the loose ends"" overlay that doesn't work on any level at all. There's neither intellectual nor emotional consistency - just a superficial gloss that fails utterly to convince. It's as if Moffat is emotionally autistic, so clumsy is the writing at times. There's just one tiny moment right before the very end that is genuinely touching and the effect, at this late stage, is simply to make the viewer think ""how did that slip through the Moffat filter??""Now that we have a new Doctor in the shape of Peter Capaldi, perhaps we can hope earnestly for a new showrunner. It's not clear how long the rebooted Doctor Who can survive under Moffat's continued leadership. People's expectations are much higher after RTD's brilliant re-awakening of the series than they were back in the long-ago days when just enough folk were content to sit through the moribund scripts and awful effects of the Jon Pertwee period.

Unfortunately the filler isn't as great. Kane comes from a family of wealth and nobility. He rejects his role in life to establish his own, a treasure seeking killer. When the devil attempts to claim Kane's soul, Kane balks and looks for a path of redemption, one that evil forces him to leave.Unfortunately the film plunged from its opening scene. Bad guys have less of the super natural special effects and Kane fights like a normal person. His relationship with Meribeth (Rachel Hurd-Wood) sputters in its development.Makes a decent rental.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1380844800,2013-10-04

Of course all the book isn't in there...if this movie intrigues you, go read it for more insanity. Another thing that has me ecstatic is that they found the perfect director for it. Don Coscarelli started with Phantasm and has done pretty well since. This book perfectly captures his directorial style.

4.0,"The quality is as good as can be expected from a 10-year-old cartoon, but it plays smoothly.  One odd complaint--the Nickelodeon &#34;intro&#34; is MUCH louder than the rest of the cartoon for some reason, and that's consistently true across all of the Dora and Diego cartoons.  When watching you may want to adjust the volume down (or mute) until the intro is done to save your TV speakers and possibly your ears.  The cartoon itself is cute and well-structured for younger children, that eventually understand what Dora is asking for and the order in which things happen on the show.  My 2-year-old girl loves it and would watch an entire season straight through if I'd let her.  It's the first cartoon like this to really capture her attention for an entire episode so that alone makes it worth the recommendation for younger children.",1392940800,2014-02-21

5.0,"If you are a big fan of 1950s crime fiction Los Angeles, this series is for you.  Frank Darabont weaves a great fictional yarn surrounding the real Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen.  A photographer with blackmail (played by Simon Pegg), a cop scarred by World War 2 (Jon Berenthal), a femme fatale (Alexa Devaros), and the LA police chief William Parker (Neal McDonough).  Another standout is Robert Knepper who plays Siegel's right hand man Sid Rothman.  Knepper's been very good in every TV series he has been on, but this particular role & director allows him to give a stellar performance.  The directing and cinematography are equally outstanding, many of the shots had me doing a quick rewind.

Don is gone most of the time, doing as he pleases, though he forbids his wife to do the same.

It seems very contrary to creativity to expect all creative people to be able to function on a team... and as a viewer, I couldn't really get a handle on each designer's perspective and point-of-view.  Also added a whole lot of drama and made it more of the kind of reality show I try to avoid.  The talent pool seemed shallow this year as well, but not sure if that had to do with teams.  (I mean - people who don't know basic design and sewing methods?)  Almost gave up halfway through - but as people were eliminated it began to seem a little more like previous seasons and one could get a better idea of a designer's aesthetic.

From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.Season 5 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season.  The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting, but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work.",1397520000,2014-04-15

5.0,"Both my wife and I have been totally hooked by this show and the third season is no exception. After the Rosie case was solved at the end of season 2, we were wondering if the new plot was going to be as exciting and complex. Luckily we were not disappointed. In this case, we find Sarah taking a break from police work and trying to live a more simple life, but when a serial killer surfaces and there is a possible connection to a case she worked on in the past, the temptation is too much and she has to return to help Holder stop the monster.As has been the case before, the acting is truly great and the mood of the story remains dark and gritty. We get to see up close the victims targeted by the serial killer, which are homeless teenage kids, and many portions of the story are truly gut wrenching. I found the connection to the other seasons through the case involving the kid that was stuck in the apartment for days with his murdered mother to be a really great idea. Especially because we get to see the father of the kid on death row and how the developments with the new case affect that portion of the story.Fans of the series already know that this is typically not a feel good kind of series, and this season is no different. You will get to see how Sarah and Holder navigate a complex case with lots of twists and turns. You will get plenty of thrills which will have you on the edge of your seat. But you will also get several moments that will make you feel sick to your stomach. As long as you are OK with that, it is time to jump in. This is the best series on television right now!",1375747200,2013-08-06

1.0,"Centurion, a Roman empire epic set in Britain in 117 AD, has many of those qualities we see in the best of this genre: A plot line as empty as Gladiator's; self-polishing abs breast plates for all officers; and Life of Brian's attention to historical accuracy. It adds blood arcing for some distance into the sky when a lance meets an eyeball. And there are two feral lady barbarians, one blond with what looks like bad teeth (Aeron, played by Axelle Carolyn) and one brunette, whose teeth look just fine, as do her breasts (Etain, played silently by Olga Kurylenko). The brunette fancies skins when she goes out hunting Romans in the deep winter forest and scanty skins when in a hut.Centurion, in other words, is as silly as they come. Briefly, it's about an attempt by the Ninth Legion, led by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West), to march north into what is now Scotland and eliminate the Pict threat. Evidently Virilus never read up on the fate of Publius Quinctilius Varus, no general but a good administrator. Marching deep into the Teutoburg Forest in what is now Germany, he and his three legions were attacked by combined Germanic tribes. Varus committed suicide in the middle of the battle. His three legions disintegrated. Probably 20,000 or more Roman soldiers died compared to a handful of barbarians.General Virilus, virile and confidant, who didn't read his history, marches his men into the thick forests of Pictland.  Flash forward to the next day. Virilus is in chains in the squalid camp of the Pict king. Most of his men have been slaughtered. Later, a handful of survivors led by Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) try to rescue him. No luck. The Pict king's young son is killed and the general dies in a forced fight with Etain. The seven Romans escape and head south with a handful of Pict hunters (led by Etain and Aeron) hot on their trail. Pict hunters die one by one; the Roman seven almost die one by one.What's good about Centurion? The make-up and the set-designer. Picts look as dirty and flea-bitten as their filthy encampments. Most of the Romans look as filthy as the Picts. There are stunning, craggy, shivering cold scenes of the Highlands.What lacks in Centurion? Characters we can give even a small hoot for. Most of the time we can't remember one from another. Fassbender seems to be a rising star, but all he's called upon to do in this movie is fight, run monotonously and look tired. Only one actor in the cast stands out as tough and smart, and that is that fine actor Liam Cunningham. He's made a lot of drek, but look for him inShooting the Past,Dog SoldiersandThe Wind That Shakes the Barley. The movie's battle scenes, particularly Virilus' march north, is shot only to show slashing swords and more spurts of blood. There's no way to follow the battles. A plot also is lacking. The first third is an excuse for gore. The last two-thirds is an excuse for gore and long-distance running. The roles of Etain and Aeron are a sop to the 18-29-year-old audience the director seems to care most for.Centurion is not a movie. It's a mediocre comic book for all those who love abs-enhancing armor, horsehair helmet crests and the inspiring National Geographic maps showing the Roman Empire at its greatest extent.",1324598400,2011-12-23
4.0,"For some people the truth can be subjective but not for Dr. Cal Lightman (Tim Roth). In the second season of the popular series ""Lie to Me"" Lightman and his associates use their skills at reading people to separate fact from fiction in helping to solve a variety of crimes from the disappearence of a amateur poker player about to win againt a quartet of professional players to determining if an executed man really did kidnap children murder them (his last facial expressions and words indicate otherwise and Lightman's testimony is what helped get him executed).The second season is marred only by the inclusion of a wealthy former client Clara Musso (Melissa George)who becomes a benefactor of The Lightman Group when Cal gives pays out his ex-wife for her half of the group in order to help her have her own law practice and prevent her from moving away. George is a marvelous actress but the character of Musso is an annoying intrusion adding nothing to the show aside from eye candy. Her three episode story arc is mercifully short and it probably doesn't help that her character is introduced in one of the weakest episodes of the bunch (although it does allow for plenty of verbal sparring between Roth as Lightman and Jennifer Beals as his ex-wife). One of the stronger series of episodes establishes a new love interest for Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams) that falls victim to Cal's obsessive need to know everyone's dirty laundry and the mysterious past of her boyfriend (Mark Martinni).Roth continues to do a spectacular job of playing a complex anti-hero of sorts; he often comes across as rude, overbearing and a know-it-all. It's easy to see why Lightman appeals to audiences as he's a complex character that some people love-to-hate.Fox has done a nice job of packaging the second season. All the episodes look quite nice with a sharp clean presentation of the show. We also get some nice extras with the second season set. Aside from the usual extras that many sets have such as a gag reel and deleted scenes, we also get a good featurette entitled ""Dr. Ekman/Dr. Lightman Lie Detection Tutoral"". Ekman is the inspiration for the Lightman character and a consultant on the show (he also appeared in the pilot episode). We also get a featurette ""Eli Loker: An Honest Man"" focusing on the employee that Lightman likes to pick on the most. ""Dr. Ekman's Blog"" is also included that gives us a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the show. Unfortunately, Fox has elected not to include any commentary tracks and there is no featurette focusing on the slight change in the character dyanmics during season two.The second season of ""Lie to Me"" features some strong episodes and although a bit uneven (especially compared to the first) the show more than holds its own. The DVD set is reasonablly priced and while it could have more special features focusing on the production of the show, etc., what we do get is quite nice.I can honestly (really!)recommend this set for fans of the first season but would suggest those coming to the show late may want to pick up the first season setLie to Me: Season Oneon DVD or the Blu-rayLie To Me: Season One [Blu-ray] and then dive into this set after they've completed season one.",1294531200,2011-01-09

5.0,"DEFINED: In economics and finance, arbitrage ( /&#712;&#593;rb&#616;tr&#593;&#720;&#658;/) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices; ALSO, expected profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always risks in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative).Richard Gere plays Robert Miller, one of the key financial movers and shakers with his own company.  However, he made one wrong move with a copper mine and now he has to sell his company so he will not end up broke and in prison (he misappropriated millions in order to cover the loss). Miller's life starts to fall apart while he is negotiating the sale, the chief catalyst being a car crash caused by his falling asleep at the wheel.  The crash kills his mistress and he sneaks away from the scene with some help. The police try to bring him to heel.What Gere portrays in this film is the very personification of arbitrage.  He is always in the market, always thinking, always leveraging and above all, dealing, dealing and then dealing some more. Although he seems to have feelings for his family and mistress, his mind never can rest on a person very long for it is always whirring, always shifting the parameters around until he finds a way out and forward.  This is both his incredible strength and his ultimate weakness. It is one heck of a performance and my favorite of his since AMERICAN GIGOLO.Other amazon reviewers have criticized the ending of the film.  I did not think it was flawed and I am going to say why but I need to put a spoiler warning in front of it as it does involve discussing the the film's ultimate resolution of this character.SPOILER........................SPOILER...................SPOILER......................SPOILER.....................SPOILER.............We end with Robert Miller (Gere) taking the microphone at a charity gala honoring him. He has just resolved some huge battles only to face another one on another front.  He has on the face he shows to the world and does not look at all intimidated. He is back in whirring mode.  His mind is going on what moves to make next.  He is used to being in tight spots.  He ENJOYS being in tight spots because they stimulate him to find a way out, to arbitrage once again. This is his entire life. He is ready for it; he is always ready for it. If he doesn't win, that is ok, as the battle is what he lives for each and every day. And, by the way, does anyone really think he doesn't have cash stashed in accounts abroad, as his wife suggests? Not me!

3.0,"Executive-produced by Ridley Scott (among nineteen producers in all), ""Welcome to the Punch"" revolves around a London police detective Max Lewinsky (James McAvoy, ""Last King of Scotland"") hunting down a master criminal Jacob Sternwood (Mark Strong, Guy Ritchie-directed ""Sherlock Holmes""). When Sternwood flies back home to meet his heavily injured son Ruan (Elyes Gabel), Max, still emotionally traumatized, is given another chance to capture Sternwood with his partner Sarah Hawks (Andrea Riseborough).This is a sophomore work from a British director Eran Creevy (""Shifty""). He effectively uses the blue-tinted images of the deserted streets and buildings of London, but despite the stylish photography and slick narrative, the story and characters needs some more details.The leading players deliver fine performances. The film's interesting cast includes Dannielle Brent, Jason Flemyng, Johnny Harris, Daniel Mays, David Morrissey and Peter Mullan. Peter Mullan gives some depth to an otherwise stereotypical role as Sternwood's trusted friend, but not enough, and Jason Flemyng and Daniel Mays are wasted in the roles that are forgettable.Fast-paced modern-day noir ""Welcome to the Punch"" adds little to the genre. With two capable leads the film starts out well, but loses its momentum in the third act that gets more familiar and predictable. Still, all in all, this is a pretty satisfactory crime thriller with some nice camerawork.",1368835200,2013-05-18

5.0,"I wrote one review on this show after 3 seasons a bit disappointed at how they sort of wasted the first half of season 3.  But after seeing the entire show I have to recant and applaud the best science fiction show I've seen on television.  Written to an actual conclusion of the story being told is rare in this genre due to so many shows simply having their budgets cut and the show end because it is not renewed.  Thankfully this show ended each season with a bang and the final season with the ultimate bang satisfying the many angles of the plot in a way that was both encouraging and emotionally satisfying in terms of our ties to the main characters.  I applaud the writing for evolving the underlying story to change the roles of the different universes/continuum's from foe to ally and then introduce the bigger threat in a way that still allowed them to bring closure to the other world characters and end on a positive note in terms of the big picture of the future.  I felt at a loss when it was over, but my only hope is more shows of such quality could be made to provide the level of entertainment and engagement that Fringe did in the future.  With the real world developments pushing into what was science fiction only decades ago it is hard to envision this genre not growing as what was just imagination becomes real and the &#34;fringe&#34; technology not so much a fantasy as a question of what the big developments are that lay ahead in our near future..  3D printing could become Star Trek's replicators, laughable 30 years ago, a real development in 2014.  My final note is the hope that the entertainment industry sees the value in producing quality Science Fiction that blends the fascinating developments of the near future with the many possibilities of where that could take us as a society, as a race, and keep backing new shows like Continuum and Defiance etc., and while your at it keep on streaming to bring a quick end to the cable industry!!!",1397865600,2014-04-19
3.0,"So, here's an honest to goodness 3 star &#34;its OK&#34;, meaning its average. Nothing wrong with it, the technical aspects were fine. The story was very interesting to me. What kept it from being more than just OK was mainly my lack of involvement with the characters. They didn't grab me. At all. So, I wasn't invested.  Not sure if it was the acting or the writing of them. The best parts in the film were the flashbacks to the original composer and what went on with him. I would've preferred to see more of that, perhaps another movie.Overall, worth a watch but not during primetime viewing.",1391904000,2014-02-09

4.0,I admit I checked this one out without any high expectations. The cast is mostly unknown to me and the story seemed a little odd. I was pleasantly surprised that the cast was actually pretty effective and the story held together and I am a fan of dark humor which runs all through this movie.

5.0,"This was another fascinating and complex novel by the master, Stephen King, and as with so many of his a true challenge to transform into film. While very different in many ways from the book, this is a wonderful mini-series/show, that takes off from the premise of King's book and beautifully expands it into a fascinating tale of the paranormal complicated by so many emotions like treachery, lust, and  greed of humans even as they try to reach an understanding of what has happened and is continuing to happen to them. When or even if it will all come to an end is an unanwered question. As the town's people move toward taking the law into their own hands under the clever manipulation of the mayor, the lynching of one of the few people who is truly a &#34;good guy&#34; and in a position to help these people survive until &#34;help&#34; of some sort can arrive or be achieved becomes emminent and provides a stunning cliff-hanger for the season finale!

If you add to that the fact that they were bringing Colton back, you can probably understand why I was expecting a below par season.Luckily, things worked out pretty good, there were some very interesting new players, a few returning ones that spiced things up in different ways, and fun challenges. But the aspect that took this season from average to very good in my eyes was the thrilling tribal councils we had this season. We get to see some of the biggest moves ever in this game, and the level of confrontation gets up there.This is one of those shows that almost never manages to bore me, and this season did its part. I will be looking forward to the next one.",1387670400,2013-12-22
5.0,"It's true that I love Asylum Blackout, but it's not without several very noticeable faults.  I'm sure I'm forgetting several in my review.  For one, it takes forever for the movie to get going and once it *does* get going, it feels like it ends way too soon.  Also, the employees that work at the asylum are suspiciously unarmed and defenseless for some bizarre reason, which doesn't make sense given the psychotic nature of the inmates.  This also doesn't make sense since the guys that work there are more like clueless punks only there to cook meals for the inmates, at least, that's the initial impression.  This makes you think it's not necessary to really care about their fate when the time comes (and trust me, you know it's coming- it's only a matter of when).I mean *every single one* of the dangerous criminals are completely psychotic and beyond the point of being unreasonable, so they obviously have nothing to lose.  Under these conditions, you'd need the best kind of protection available to assure your safety but... apparently not in this asylum.  Strange.Obviously the inmates were made so psychotic for the purpose of delivering a suspense/horror movie.  Regardless of these issues, the final 30 minutes is pretty darn entertaining.  This is when the employees basically spend their time tucking and hiding under tables and inside storage rooms, and anywhere they can just to escape the army of crazy criminals released after a blackout locks everyone inside.  These bad boys are motivated to destroy as much of the asylum as possible... and that's another flaw.  Wouldn't you want to capture and kill the employees if you're an asylum?  After all, you'd want to get rid of anything that could possibly stand in the way of your persuit of escaping.  Then again maybe the inmates intention was never to escape after all and just go crazy on everything around them?I have to ask, who in their right mind would EVER create an asylum under these conditions?  The electric goes out, all criminals are released?  It's hilarious to think such a scenario is possible. Also, the segments involving a phone hitting the head of one of the main characters and still working perfectly fine... and later the phone call to the cops where the cop for whatever reason doesn't seem interested or lacks the proper attention span to understand a man CLEARLY and desperately explaining the emergency situation over the phone... a typical trait of horror movies is to be totally clueless and lack logic on the part of the helpful folks, of course.  Can't have the good guys making an easy escape can we?  These are all flaws that should have been changed before the movies release in my opinion.However I still firmly stand behind my 5-star rating.  The final 30 minutes drastically picks up concerning the entertainment level as violent deaths occur one after another, along with people getting burned, tortured, stabbed and even decapitated.  All wonderful additions to a horror movie and totally appropriate for a movie about inmates escaping and running wild.  The atmosphere is decent towards the end too, especially when the employees run for their lives only to reach a dead end on a couple occasions.  A feeling of dread and concern for their safety occurs for you the viewer, which is a beautiful piece of writing and even looks frightening on TV.Great movie, regardless of the weak low budget acting and the hit or miss storytelling that takes a while to get underway.  Also regardless of that one song that plays a couple times (most notable during the credits) that sounds like it's copying the mid 70's period of the Kinks directly (and I KNOW it's ripping off another 70's song too- if only I could figure out which one, hmmm).  I highly recommend this movie, but don't expect anything greater than typical Hollywood exaggerated suspense.  Do NOT expect a bunch of logical situations either.",1383782400,2013-11-07

5.0,"Vikings is a great TV series because it blends fact with enough fiction to make it enjoyable to watch. Sure, it's can be a Game of Thrones clone at times, but it packs enough of its own unique elements to be original too. LikeGame of Thrones: The Complete First Season, the top-billing star is axed midway through for what looks like budget constraints. This crippled GoT and it may do the same to Vikings. Unlike GoT, the main events revolve around one character who is the central focus of the entire story. Also, Vikings traverses far darker material than GoT. This is surprising, since Vikings was produced for cable TV, which means that it lacks the T&A; and intense gore of anything you will find on HBO.The most polarized sub-conflict is Ragnar Lothbrok's thirst for conquest versus the unwavering faith of his Christian slave--a monk kidnapped during a raid. Ragnar is sharp, cunning, and always wears an evil grin while his priest slave is contemplative, weak, and innocent. These two characters seem to clash in their core ideals, even though they develop a close personal relationship (at one point Ragnar invites the monk to have a threesome with his wife). Ragnar's wife obliges, going so far as to show a little thigh to the chaste young friar. The monk declines and gropes his Bible in wanton lust before spitting out 10 Hail Marys and an Our Father in rapid-fire succession.The pilot is weak and the finale is even more of a letdown, but everything in between is stellar. The writers of Vikings did an excellent job as the script is clear, precise, and injects action at just the right points. It can be slow, but it's not convoluted like Robert Jordan's televised slogfest. There are no colliding characters with their own separate plot lines to worry about; this is Ragnar Lothbrok's show. The actor who plays Ragnar is a no-namer, but he seems to possess the leading power to pull off the role with ease, and is one evil looking Norse badass to boot.",1369094400,2013-05-21

4.0,The show is simply enjoyable to watch.  The writers have done a nice job of developing the characters each with distinctive traits that blend well together and the casting selections were well chosen. We like how it weaves the use of old-school technology and. references to historical figures with futuristic/fictional tech.  Kinda like running the starship enterprise from a cozy gadgety-filled man caveish basement. It's a bit like Dr. Who in how it incorporates real history into fantastical plots.  It's not the history channel but it's not intended to be.  It's an enjoyable show with a comidic touch combined with scify drama that family members of all ages in our house enjoy watching.  The characters care about each other - like family.  It's not as clever as the Matt Smith episodes of Dr. Who but it's still good stuff.,1388793600,2014-01-04

5.0,"I was one of those who came late to the Leverage party. Consequently, I didn't get the pleasure of watching and discussing with other fans of the show. The DVD with and without Commentary allows me to watch my favorite shows while also listening to commentary from the writers, directors, actors. And much like many fans of Christian Kane, the pleasure is watching him as Eliot Spencer. Listening to the commentary is a lot of fun because Devlin & Rogers often comment on small nuisances that Kane does in his acting performance that I admit to having missed on the first watch. They will talk about a facial expression or a line delivery or something small that they admit expands his acting range. It's no wonder that they tapped him for their newest series The Librarians on TNT.Any fan of the show is encouraged to get the DVD for the commentaries alone but also to watch their favorite episodes over-and-over.

2.0,"The writers have ruined this show! or just ran out of ideas to make it interesting. I used to be a huge fan of the first and second seasons, then came third season and my fondness just jumped out of the window. Where's the magic? Where's the humour? I think the creators of the show has swayed from it's original premise that now it became a shell of it's old self.The plot lines are so ridiculous and utterly boring this season they just make me have ADD. Max going to pastry school that the 2 broke girls can't afford as usual, but Caroline offers to work in exchange for the incredible sum of fees! She never does any working, instead falls head over heels with Chef Nicolas the owner of the pastry school who happens to be married, almost all episodes out so far are dedicated to their interaction; I can sum it up in a couple of sentences;Caroline: Chef Nicolas you're so hot but you're also married I can never date a married man! Chef Nicolas: It's okay, me and my wife have an open marriage we can sleep with whoever we want to, besides she's in France *stereotypical much* Caroline: NO, I shall not sleep with you even if I want to! Leave your wife first. Chef Nicolas: Okay, I'll break up with her if that means having a chance with you even though I don't really know you that well.. Caroline: You can't break up with your wife! I can't ruin your marriage.Boring or what? If you think Caroline's romantic interest was repetitive then Max's even worse! She's dating Deke a guy from her pastry class who's a billionaire and lives in a dumpster? Cause he's a hippie? and they too broke up because Max couldn't handle the fact that her boyfriend is a rich person even though she's been friends with Caroline who used to be rich and worked as a baby sitter for a Rich Manhattan socialist in season one? Cut me a slack! Drama for the sake of drama...That is what this season has been about so far, no more concern about making it into the cupcake business there's very little focus on the business that'll supposedly make them rich. The majority of the show is focused on their boring romances. Oleg, Sophie, Han and Earl all these loveable supporting characters are somehow forgotten in the process and no longer have enough screen play. The jokes are no longer funny just obnoxious! The girls seem irritating this season and their boyfriends even more so.2 broke girls was a show that was funny! Yes, it was blunt and ridiculous to a degree but I enjoyed it! I loved what the premise was about. It was about building a dream out of scratch and it was hilarious because they would fail multiple times but that never stopped them. Now, it's just not what it used to be.Bring back the heart and soul of the show cause this season just seems formulaic, unfortunately this is no longer a weekly watch for me.",1394582400,2014-03-12

It isn't on a par with some of the other animation movies out there, but it is nowhere near being really bad. I was somewhat shocked at the people who hated it, but then there is no accounting for tastes. Cute, non-offensive, but still gently skewers the 'you are different from me' mentality. Overall, a solid 4 for animation quality, gentle skewers, and amenability.",1339459200,2012-06-12
5.0,"Amid the current crop of slasherly, hyperviolent horror films, ""The Orphanage,"" from Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, stands out as an artful, restrained gem of the genre. The movie is driven by plot, personality, fine acting and gorgeous cinematography.  Although many elements are familiar (with wisps of ""The Shining,"" ""The Devil's Backbone,"" and numerous other classics...) the film still feels fresh.  Lead actor Belen Rueda's turn as a mother fighting to get her child back from the grip of supernatural forces is a powerful performance; indeed, everything about this film is well-crafted and intelligently assembled. Worth checking out!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1211932800,2008-05-28
5.0,Covert Affairs is an enjoyable series with a woman lead character. The supporting cast make an entertaining program seem totally believable. Where else can a very light weight woman beat off men and women and not sustain one scratch?,1392940800,2014-02-21

5.0,"I wanted to Give Season 3 a poke in the head and put it out of its misery. How much of the Crazy Governor were they going to force on us? How many close ups of Rick's crazy eyes? How long was the sublimely oblivious Andrea going to overlook the fact that her boyfriend was stark raving nutso?  Michone, who started out impossibly over-the-top with her matched pair of pet zombies on leashes, is much more real and interesting now. No longer acting like a rebellious 13-year-old, she still wields her katanka with amazing accuracy, but has become more three-dimensional and less of a cartoon character. She is spending most of her time with the survivors and only semi-hunting for the governor...he's not completely out of the picture although I do hope he's going to be held down to a minimum. I just wish they had not killed off Merle in Season 3. He was one of my favorite characters...what's not to like about a guy who can cut off his own limb and replace it with a swiss army arm?I started watching Season 4 without much hope and boy howdy, was I surprised. There's life the The Dead yet.  Episode 1 was killer. Rick regained his sanity, sort of.  His son is less psychotic. Herschell's missing leg has magically regenerated. No explanations are given, but the comic book version does mention that they find, at some point, a prosthetic limb (but it's just a leg, with no interesting accessories like Merle's replacement part). I have not read the comic version, but Amazon reviewer Brian Byrd gave me that heads up elsewhere.Episode 1 has several truly creepy scenese, not least of all is Rick's encounter with a young Irish lass in the forest. We also have lots of new survivors, most of them from Woodbury, home of the Crazy Governor.In the following episodes, a serious and highly contageous illness hits the prison compound. A high death rate and those who succumb reanimate. This does two things: it gives us a new story arc and gets rid of some of the newbies. By episode 4, we're back to our core group (mostly...heh heh). And the Zombies are rocking. More hordes and they're dangerous and frightening again. For most of Season 3, the poor Zeds were nothing more than pests. Unless you were tied to a chair and locked in a room with one, they posed no threat anymore. The survivors just swatted 'em like mosquitos. Season 4 has given them back their teeth.As always, the producers' ruthlessness in cutting cast members is still shaking things up. No one is Zombie-proof or bullet-proof and some of our original recipe survivors don't make it. Unfortunately Glenn is not among the victims. Sorry, but Season 3 was seriously marred by those endless ""let's drag in the kids"" scenes of Glen and Maggie making out.  Almost as sleep-inducing as Rick and the Governor's staring contests.  We also lose two of my favorite original survivors by the end of Season 4, one by exile and one by the governor sawing off his head. Yep, the Guv continued to make trouble in Season 4, but in a more intersting way than in Season 3. No longer ""The Guv,"" he wants to be known simply as ""Brian."" But he's still nuttier than a fruitcake, just in a different way. I'm hoping the exiled character comes back. Not in the reanimated sense, just in the ""Hi Honey, I'm home"" way.Episode 4 is intense, exciting and gory. Everything you want from The Walking Dead.  I had to stop watching and take breaks from the action and mayhem once or twice.  The writers have really stepped things up. The Zoombas are on the march; the new characters are interesting, particularly a little girl who sometimes mistakes the Zs for pets (but not in that silly Michone way).Episodes 5 through 7 were just as good, and the season ender was a shocker. You have to give the writers and producers credit, they'll throw anyone to the wolves (or the zombies).  No one is guaranteed to survive until the time time. Makes for some really intense viewing.Let's hope next season remains reanimated or the producers will find it's their audience, not the dead, who are walking.",1381708800,2013-10-14

3.0,"It's an okay show.  The actors did a great job it's just that the story was a bit slow.  i watched the first season hoping it would get better but it didn't and i decided not to watch the second season.  the show is focused on the late 50s and I guess back then the Prime Minister's office had a huge influence on what was reported on the news and what wasn't.

Wow! no really, Wow!))I made the very evident mistake of complaining after the second episode, that Continuum had lost its most core theme/principle; what is good vs. what is evil (subtext: corporate corruption) to its more sensational plot setting; time travel.  Not only was I wrong, this season, has taken new, deeper and more complex questions to its audience with every turn and in every episode since..  Then, 3 Minutes to Midnight!  Holly s***!

5.0,"I am sorry to admit that I have only recently discovered this series, and that too by way of the remake, which is available via streaming as well. I was not sure what to expect with the original, but I had read glowing reviews of the show, and decided to give it a try (it didn't hurt that season one of this show was available free for download for Prime members, but alas, not the subsequent seasons).This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Three is as intriguing as the previous two seasons though dark clouds hang over the Bellamy household. A terrible tragedy causes much strife and chaos in the Bellamy household. Son James falls in love with a woman not of his social class, and the staff downstairs are also experiencing problems of their own. Finances in the Bellamy household are tight this season and the residents of 165 Eaton Place are forced to economize, both upstairs and downstairs.This third season of the show sees a death in the family, a marriage, a murderer putting the lives of the residents of 165 Eaton in danger, and the possibility of romance! The writing as always is engaging, and the plot lines keep me riveted to the screen! I am hopelessly addicted to this show now, and the new remake truly can't compare to the writing and acting in the original!Forget the insipid shows that pass off as entertainment these days - I'll have a cuppa and watch these over any day!",1330560000,2012-03-01

1.0,"I am truly amazed that I sat through this entire movie. However, you need to realize that I went into it knowing that it would be a train wreck, but it was far worse than I expected. ""Liz and Dick"" is a bloody massacre. For the record, I am actually a member of Team LiLo. As a child star, she showed great potential as a solid B-actress (remember ""The Parent Trap,"" Freaky Friday,"" and of course the iconic ""Mean Girls?""). Then Lindsay Lohan grew up, went to rehab 50 times, got arrested 105 times, and unfortunately she hasn't shown a whole lot of promise since then. I actually feel bad for her because she was so horribly miscast in this role. Lifetime obviously was desperate for viewers, and they cast LiLo as Elizabeth Taylor because they knew people like me would watch. And I did. And LiLo totally bombed.In fairness, the entire movie is an epic disaster (the only saving graces are the costumes, so props to the wardrobe mistress). First, let's talk about Lindsay. Ignore the fact that my cat looks more like Liz Taylor than LiLo does (as I recall, Liz's entire body wasn't covered in freckles). Unfortunately, LiLo put absolutely zero effort into preparing for this role. What you see for two hours is LiLo wearing a bunch of dark wigs, speaking in her regular LiLo voice. There was no attempt to master Liz's signature dialect, or the way she carried herself, or absolutely anything at all. Heck, she didn't even try to ACT most of the time. Everything was completely half-assed. Even when she was playing Angry Drunk Elizabeth and smashing bottles against the wall, her throws were just PITIFUL. It was insulting. The dude playing Richard Burton is only slightly better because he actually tries to act, but just happens to be a really bad actor (decked out in an even worse hairpiece). The sets are awful. The script is languid. And parts of the movie make no sense whatsoever. (Like, they constantly poke fun at Liz for being chubby, but I read that LiLo is so vain that she refused to wear any kind of fat suit for the film, so Richard is poking fun at fat Liz who is wearing skintight leather pants and can't weigh more than 105 pounds. Rewrite, anyone?)Everything. Is. SO. AWFUL. If you go into the film expecting to be entertained by watching really bad Lifetime television, like I was, you may end up pleasantly surprised in that ""Liz and Dick"" is ten times worse than anything you could have possible imagined it to be. My husband likened it to watching a high school theatre production, but I think that analogy is insulting to high school actors everywhere. Bottom line: Dame Elizabeth is rolling in her grave right now. I am glad she didn't live to witness this monstrosity.",1353888000,2012-11-26

4.0,"We are witnessing some very disturbing incidents in this country at present - senseless killings by soldiers who have been mentally bruised by the combat in the seemingly endless wars in the Middle East.  REDEMPTION brings an extreme example of how combat exposure can damage otherwise stable persons and if that aspect of the story could have been more explored the movie would have been better.As it is REDEMPTION (aka HUMMINGBIRD for reasons obvious after seeing the film) is a fine Jason Statham movie as written and directed by Steven Knight who has given us Eastern Promises, Amazing Grace and Dirty Pretty Things. The film is greatly enhanced by the cinematography by Chris Menges and the original musical score by Dario Marianelli.  But in the end the film belongs to Jason Statham who may possible be offering his best role to date.Joey Jones (Jason Statham) is an alcoholic, homeless military deserter on the run from a military court martial: being caught up in the life or death circumstances and the eye for an eye philosophy of the Afghanistani war zone he fled the unbearable trauma and has been hiding his memories in alcohol, living with street people, sharing a cardboard box with fellow homeless Isabel (Victoria Bewick). His food comes from a Redemption House mission run by nun Sister Cristina (the fine Polish actress Agata Buzek) who has past secrets of her own. One night Joey is beaten severely by gang members and Isabel escapes. After this Joey flees, falls (literally) into the fancy apartment of a photographer who is on vacation and there he decides to turn his life around. He gives up alcohol, works out on the roof to rebuild his body, shaves his long hair, dresses in the owner's clothes, uses the owner's TM card for money and sets out to make a living working in a Chinese restaurant. His talents as a brilliant fighter are noted and soon he is making big money working as a `fixer', and his life becomes one of an avenging angel, giving his `fixer' earnings to Sister Cristina and to his ex-wife and child. The action is non-stop with many intrusions of nightmares from Joey's experiences in Afghanistan, the subplots are strong, and though some aspects of each of the characters are not fully drawn, there is enough of a forward lunging story to satisfy - even the rather surprising ending. Certainly this is a film that will satisfy the legions of Jason Statham fans. Grady Harp, June 13",1372464000,2013-06-29
4.0,"For those of you who are wondering, this show will NOT be getting a Blu-Ray release.  According to the press release, the DVD will include the following special features:- Reign: The Making of a Queen- The Authenticity of Reign: Recreating the 16th Century- Deleted ScenesSubtitles are listed to be included in several languages (as is typical of Warner TV releases).  I'll update my review after I've had a chance to get the DVD for myself.As far as the show goes, I watched it hoping for a CW-ized version of ""The Tudors,"" and basically got that. Fabulous teens in fabulous clothes, acting against the backdrop of trendy music. After a handful of episodes, I managed to convert my wife over to the show, and we spent the second half of the season watching it together and having a hoot.We would laugh, we would guess what kind of twist was going to happen next (and were usually right), yet it felt more like we were laughing along *with* the show, not so much *at* it.The production team undoubtedly knows exactly what kind of show they're making, and they must have a blast doing it, because we have a blast watching it. It's silly, but in all of the right ways: the very definition of a guilty pleasure, yet one that I'll recommend despite the knowledge that I'll be ""judged"" for the admission that I love it.I couldn't help but smile after seeing how the program got lambasted on twitter for being ""historically inaccurate."" Criticizing Reign for being historically inaccurate is like criticizing Star Wars for being scientifically inaccurate. It seems that access to Wikipedia makes people feel like experts in history, so when I see hilarious complaints like ""Mary has no Scottish accent"" based on a total lack of knowledge, I know exactly what type of people these critics are: people who have no ACTUAL knowledge of history, but want to be trendy nonetheless.So let's set that complaint aside, and enjoy the show and its fun ""twists"" on historical events (there's a wonderful one in the season finale).PARENTAL NOTE: There is a moderate amount of violence, more graphic than you would typically see on network TV, and plenty of sexual content that wouldn't fly, save for the setting.",1403568000,2014-06-24
2.0,"First let me preface by saying I've followed Doctor Who through most of it's lifetime, never got that excited about it.Then there was the whole Russel Davies resurrection of it and I was hooked.  It jumped the shark a lot over the seasons, many omg what were they thinking moments, but if you twisted your ""head"" just right, it was a pretty enjoyable experience and I've watched seasons 1-6 multiple times and not regretted the price of admittance (Amazon for a lot of it).Season 6, enjoyed it, though was getting a might tired with the ""and then there was a paradox... and everyone lived happily ever after"".  Moffat, I've loved his stuff, Hyde and Sherlock being two series well worth watching.  Though admittedly several years later I still puzzle over Hyde.That said...  This season for whatever reason they're doing ""small stories"", that winds up being pretty boring and predictable.  They're getting rid of Amy and Rory (that's happened in an episode that's aired already so not viewing that as being a spoiler of any sort), and they wind up spending way too long with everyone giving each other long sad looks.... Boring.In this specific episode, plot was predictable, their work on having the Doctor being at a ""darker"" place since he's been wandering around without companions a lot doesn't work all that well.  The cyborg in the episode, well, I think I could come up with something better looking.Alien ship lands in the old west in the USCyborg looking for the doctordoctor and companions show upI'm being kind by giving it two stars and no have no desire to see the episode again, just not that much fun.",1349481600,2012-10-06

4.0,"So, I'm not even really sure what to say about this.  It's.... well, it's definitely high definition.  The random crap they put on the screen is certainly very, very clearly random crap.  What I don't understand is why anyone would want such a complicated screen saver because fundamentally speaking, that's what it is.On the slightly more serious side, I can see why this might be relaxing.  It's just pure random nothing and if you stare at it long enough it does start to mesmerize you.  The CGI is about 1990s quality and the music is a sort of vague, slow electronica that's also from the 90s.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews.

It's also just fun to watch because of the action and suspense. It's also educational because it exposes us to the fact that what happens in the film probably happens in real life all the time without our knowledge.

2.0,"Grave Encounters 2 is a found-footage film that follows Alex, an aspiring filmmaker; Alex, who recently posted a negative review for ""Grave Encounters"", begins to receive eerie messages that have him questioning the original film's authenticity. Alex eventually believes the film is real, and convinces his friends to travel with him to the Grave Encounters' shooting location, a mental hospital, to get proof. Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept, but lacks the essential horror elements (terror, suspense, atmosphere, etc.)The story in Grave Encounters 2 is interesting; I know this concept has been done before, but it's not something that's been overdone, so I was genuinely interested. The execution, however, was poor. The film uses the first 30 minutes or so to build up the mystery and introduce/develop the characters. A horror film with build-up and characters? Great! However, the build-up/mystery in this film is very dull since it lacks suspense and creepiness, and the characters aren't actually deep, despite spending a third of the film learning about them- we see the surface of the characters, and they're irritable and illogical. So, the first act of the film is basically useless backstory that could've been told more efficiently.The rest of the film takes place in the mental hospital. Again, the tension is absent throughout the film; this makes the jump-scares ineffective, except for 1 or 2. Most of the film is the group walking into a room, seeing something paranormal and being chased out; running from room to room, you'd think you were watching an episode of Scooby Doo. I won't spoil the final third of the film, but it's actually somewhat decent; the explanation is twisted and somewhat unique; I'm sure there are a few hardcore Grave Encounter fans that will enjoy it. I'm not saying it's the greatest finale, but it adds to the dull atmosphere/tone of this film. My final complaint for the movie overall: the poor use of an immensely creepy and haunting setting- the opportunity to build a dreadful atmosphere is completely missed, and the setting is basically ignored. The acting was mostly good, occasionally some of the dialogue would feel forced and there was some overacting.Overall, Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept and a decent final act. But, most of the film is uneventful, boring, and uninspired; the tension is absent, the jump-scares are ineffective, and poorly uses, actually, completely forgets about it's setting. Barely enough to warrant 2 stars, I recommend a rental for horror fans. As of 2/23/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.Grave Encounters 2 has strong violence and blood.",1361664000,2013-02-24

5.0,"For the final season of ""Chuck"", producers Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak faced a daunting dramatic challenge: how to generate new drama, comedy and romance for a great show.  After all, at the end of season four, nice guy CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levy) finally married his lovely CIA partner Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), after protecting the birth of niece Clara to sister Ellie and brother-in-law Captain Awesome.  Operation Bartkowski was officially ended, leaving Chuck, Sara, gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin), and Chuck's best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) without a mission.  The solution: reshuffle the deck.Using money from Alexei Volkov, last season's leading villain, Chuck, Sara, Casey, and Morgan go into the private spy business, only to discover the competition can be quite fierce.  Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) has a recurring role as the cutthroat leader of a rival firm, and as someone with a history, and maybe a future, with Casey.  Morgan, who ended up last season with the Intersect in his head, discovers the hard way the challenges of having super spy skills, and in the process damages his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.  Chuck, reduced to basic nice guy computer nerd, goes through his own period of painful adjustment, before having to face his greatest opponent one more time.  Sara Walker's long-missing mother will make an appearance at a vital moment, while fans will be treated to additional fun with the BuyMore gang, and to additional Bartkowski family comedy (and drama over Chuck and Sara's future).Team Bartkowski will face a series of threats from rogue CIA agents, including one who sets up the team for the crime of the century, leaving the team with a choice of jail or life on the run.  In a tense multi-episode conclusion, Chuck and Sara will battle one last ruthless opponent for control of the Intersect and everything they have built together.  The suspense will be good to the last drop.""Chuck: The Complete Fifth Season"" has the last 13 episodes of the show and is highly recommended to its dedicated fans.  The DVD set includes the usual blooper reel, deleted scenes, and a few farewell features.",1323561600,2011-12-11
5.0,"While with the introduction of Sam Carter from Sg1 helps boost the fanbase and ratings for the series overall the series has reached a decent peak in its entertainment and sci-fi value for many sci-fan fans of this series and others.  While it came as no surprise it did feel a little unneeded to make a formal couple out Shepard and Teyla but oh well, also it's nice to see that the writers have allowed the side characters to have their own romantic relationships in the series too.  While we still have the Wraith and Replicators in the series they haven't seemed as much the viable threat they were made out to be in the previous seasons or series though they still are a threat.  The season shows the strong point of the series until the final season which sadly concludes this growing but sadly stumped series.",1349222400,2012-10-03

The show misses 5 star rating for me because I don't think the people who judge the dancers along with Abby are equal to her.

5.0,"My wife and I had never heard of this series, but found it on Amazon Prime.  The male lead is recognizable from the hit cable series &#34;Homeland.&#34;  Yes, it's another cop detective drama and there's always a murder to solve.  But there are enough other quirky plot twists and the murders also have twists.  You find out right away that the male lead detective was himself framed and spent 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.  So these various parallel plots and plot twists keep it very interesting. The acting is good and there is also an element of humor.  So all in all, it is a very entertaining series that makes you want to keep watching it.",1391817600,2014-02-08

4.0,"Say this much for the Brits they sure know how to make great Armageddon movies i.e ""Twenty Eight Days Later"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"".  ""Perfect Sense"" works for the most part but doesn't quite hit it out of the ballpark.  Where it is most successful is in portraying the world breaking down.  Director David MacKenzie probably didn't have the resources of your typical Hollywood disaster pic but he successfully melds scenes of his own creation with news footage to create a society in chaos.  Where the film falls short is in its central conceit of the world falling deeper into the abyss as the passion between the central lovers(Ewan McGregor and Eva Green) intensifies.  Are these events the result of the lovers actions or despite them?  The film, to me, doesn't give a satisfactory answer.  This is no fault of McGregor and Green whose scenes together have a charged eroticism.  Ultimately, though, ""Perfect Sense"" is an interesting film that falls short of greatness.",1353801600,2012-11-25

4.0,"There are no real surprises in this series so far - the fun and games are everything we've seen before but with a new crew. I wish the show would actually demonstrate some cooking techniques and recipes and focus less on the manufactured drama between individuals. Better yet, I wish I could buy a version without the dramatic and unnecessary FOX music which just drives me crazy.Still, it's a fun show and generally seems to push in the right direction. I really hate the endless Walmart plugs; seriously, if you're a Michelin-starred Chef, you're not buying fillet from the big W. Given that the focus is on skill, originality and excellence, it's an anathema to include Walmart anywhere. That aside, it's always interesting as a show and though I've only seen the top 10 together, my suspicion is that Jessie will win.",1373414400,2013-07-10

3.0,"Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) a novelist with writer's block after the tragic death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish)  decides to get away to their summer place by a lake. He has high hopes to communicate with his wife beyond the grave and he soon starts to once he arrives. But the ghost of a dead singer, named Sara Tidwell (Anika Joni Rose) also starts to communicate with him their through an old recordplayer.He also finds himself in the middle of a custody battle between a widower, Mattie (Melissa George) and her evil father in-law Max Devore (William Schallert) when he saves Mattie's daughter from getting hit by a car. Since Max is a powerful man, he wants to bully Mike into admitting that Mattie is a bad mom and that she wasn't watching her child. In-order to help Mattie's daughter, like Jo wants him to, Mike must discover the town's dark secrets.The film is a decent adaption of the Stephen King book, but that's all director Mick Garris, is capable of, either decent adaptions, like this and the Stand or really bad ones, like Desperation. What makes Bag of Bones only decent is that it just moves along slowly with Pierce Brosnan acting pretty casual about being haunted or the other strange happenings. Melissa George acts pretty casual about the strange things going on as well. The director, takes an interesting story and manages to make it kind of dull and not even scary.I think a more talented director could have got better performances out of Brosnan and George since they aren't bad actors. Garris should only be handed King adaptions that weren't big successes. For instance, he needs to be kept away from the Dark Tower, Under the Dome, Duma Key, Insomnia, the Talisman or anything else that has potential as a movie or mini-series.",1326067200,2012-01-09
4.0,"The Killing is a re-creation of a hit Swedish show and has officially been killed by A.M.C. Again another amazing show gets swept under the rug. Even if you have the best show in the world, when you hardly advertise it and bury it on Friday's at ten, what do you think is going to happen to it? I mentioned to half a dozen people that I was watching this show and not a single one of them had ever heard of it!? That is besides the point though, my job is review the content and what I saw was very different. The Killing actually took some time to grow on me. It is everything that's advertised, but it's a bit unusual. Rosie Larsen is a seemingly innocent seventeen year old girl, whose body is found inside the trunk of a car, belonging to the campaign of a Mayoral candidate. After the premier episode that introduces us to everyone, the following episodes are broken up into segments. One closely follow every aspect of the police investigation, which is really fascinating. It's also somewhat strange as the two detectives are both in their twenties. Linden (Mireille Enos) has a past, is extremely dedicated to he job, and seemingly has no emotion. Her partner Holder (Joel Kinnaman) is young, good looking, and may have called in some favors to get the job he has. Holder is short tempered and immature, the perfect opposite of Linden, making them a very interesting pair. The next set of segments follows the Mayoral race, we get to deeply know both candidates, their campaigns, and the people who work for them, giving us an unlimited number of suspects. The last of the regular segments, features the heartbroken family of Rosie Larsen and in detail it shows how it effects each member. The story being told is one of the best I've ever seen in a TV show. No one is what they seem, everyone is a suspect, and their are so many twists and turns that you'll be doubting yourself as much as the investigators doubt their instincts. The cast is equally as good and in fact is what makes this show unique. The characters are not the type of characters you'd expect to see in this type of show. The personalities don't quite fit the roles and it leads to some very unusual, but interesting scenes. The Killing was thoroughly enjoyable and should have been a tremendous hit, but poor rating and a network that wasn't really devoted to the show led to it's demise.",1361491200,2013-02-22
4.0,"Season 1 did more for me than season 2.At its core, it's the same formulaic cop show that ever station on TV has 40 copies of, and has been showing nonstop since 1998.  However, it puts an X-Men-ish spin on the crimes themselves and the people solving them, and it makes the characters more dynamic, and the resulting cases a lot more fun.  The dialogue is perfectly servicable - no one's gonna think they're watching HBO, but it's equal or better to any of the swathe of Criminal Minds, Numbers, etc. shows that are on these days.Good (but not great) cast of characters.  The autistic kid who can see electromagnetic spectrums was by far the most fun character in the show, with the lead Doctor a close second.  As you can tell from my review, written 6 days after finishing the series, the names weren't exactly distinctive enough to make a memorable impression.Solid show - especially considering that it was a Syfy original!",1395014400,2014-03-17

Needless to say they never actually make it to the hospital.  At times this reminded me of The Hitcher (Rutger Hauer version), but with a lighter tone and significantly less sadism.  Samuel L Jackson hasn't been this good in anything in years--he's genuinely scary and engaged, which hasn't really been the case with much of anything he's appeared in since Pulp Fiction.  Even though Meeting Evil isn't always all that believable it is very entertaining.",1336694400,2012-05-11

3.0,"This documentary celebrates the work of Rick Hall, who grew up in poverty but who eventually became the force behind the Muscle Shoals operation, that continues to this day in Alabama.  From a personal point of view, Hall's life has been touched by tragedy; his mother left him, his father died in a tractor accident and a brother was scalded to death.  But this has been offset by his energy and sheer entrepreneurial skill in creating Fame Studios.  Greg 'Freddy' Camalier's film is full of insights - the fact that most of the backing tracks on some of the classic soul works recorded at Fame (by Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge and Aretha Franklin were provided by a caucasian group, who later left Hall to found their own recording studio close by to Hall's.  We also learn how Muscle Shoals became a magnet for groups worldwide including the Rolling Stones and Traffic.  The ambiance might appear unprepossessing, the facilities somewhat rudimentary; but the sound quality and technical support available there was second to none.  This is chiefly down to Hall's influence; he comes across as someone driven by the need for success, much of which he has achieved over five decades.  The only criticism of MUSCLE SHOALS is structural: director Camalier interweaves past and present narratives in such a way as to make it difficult to distinguish between them, especially if viewers are unfamiliar with the music being discussed.  Perhaps there might have been a case for cutting down on the number of celebrity reminiscences (which tend to be superficial at best) and introducing a narrator to offer some sort of guidance to the uninitiated.",1402444800,2014-06-11

3.0,"It's always risky to name your movie something like ""It's a Disaster.""  Naturally, it gives film critics -- and wannabe film critics -- some pretty hefty ammunition.  And the film better be really good; otherwise that ammunition might just blow up in the film's face at review time.This doesn't quite happen with this film, but not for lack of trying.  I haven't looked at who directed or wrote this film yet, but evidently, one or both of them are probably fans of Woody Allen.  The dialog in Mr. Allen's films usually work, even though that dialog isn't always exactly realistic, and the dialog here isn't really completely realistic either.  After all, if you thought that the world might be ending, would you be standing around cracking jokes and making dessert?  I wouldn't.  I'd be finding the bottled water in the basement and the guns upstairs, and in a hurry.But there are a few funny lines here, my favorite coming from Julia Stiles and a gal who is late, once again, to the standard Sunday brunch.  The other gal is therefore not allowed to come into the house where it is safe, as Ms. Stiles leaves the door ""barricaded"" with duct tape.  The dialog starts out something like the following:  Ms. Stiles:  ""Well, maybe this will teach you a lesson from now on to show up on time.  You're always late to Sunday brunch.""  Latecomer:  ""Is that what this is all about?"" etc. etc.  I got a good chuckle out of that sequence, and most likely, you will you when you listen to the rest of it.  Heck, Woody Allen might even think it's funny.While this film has it's moments, it feels a little ""off"" to me at the same time.  Perhaps if I were a 20-something this film would have worked better for me, as then I probably wouldn't have watched almost every Woody Allen film ever made, as I have by now, and I wouldn't understand how good well-written dialog can be.  But I think that this film would have worked probably better as a play.  After all, it takes place in a very confined space in a very confined period of time with a very confined handful of friends.  And it's mostly dialog-driven, which would lend itself more to the stage then screen.Still, it's probably worth a peek, but only a peek.  Because, while it's surely not a total disaster, it isn't very earth shattering either.",1381104000,2013-10-07

That comes out to about 1 penny per minute, probably about the best value available via DVD.I appreciate the 23-episode season, which used to be common, but now 10-15 episode seasons have become common on so many cable networks. It is frustrating to wait a year for a release and then get through an entire ""season"" in just a couple days.",1392249600,2014-02-13
3.0,"Heartfelt family drama or wacky screwball road trip? The new film ""Why Stop Now?"" tries to combine these two disparate genres. The end result is a chaotic scramble that is at its most successful when it quiets down and trusts its characters. The film boasts A-list talent like Melissa Leo and Jesse Eisenberg, here playing mother and son. Epitomizing the frustrations of a deeply troubled family unit, the two actually have a fair number of effective and emotional scenes. There is an underlying truth to the central story that is easy to identify with. But this is not intended to be a serious study of dysfunction and addiction, the screenplay also wants to take us on a ribald and outrageous journey. Personally, I think that sounds like a fine idea. The problem is that these scenes severely clash with the more nuanced moments. I won't deny that ""Why Stop Now?"" made me smile at a few of its sillier situations, but this might be a case of trying too hard! Instead of clever dialogue or amusing writing, every member of the cast simply ups the volume on their performance for the comedy bits. And louder does not make anything more funny. The actors are game and committed, the screenplay just doesn't back them up.Eisenberg plays a piano prodigy going to the biggest audition of his life. This happens to coincide with the day that Leo is going to enter a rehabilitation facility for her on-going drug problem. As the responsible member of the family, Eisenberg is nearly cracking under the pressure especially when considering the options for his future. The audition might be his escape, if only he can get his mom to step up to the plate for his younger sister. An unexpected turn at the treatment program, however, derails their whole day. Soon the pair will be screaming (literally) their way around town for a series of increasingly perplexing adventures. Joining a friendly dealer Tracy Morgan (he's more bark than bite), the day includes war reenactments, a quinceanera, and more family bickering than on a season of your favorite sitcom. Can Eisenberg pull it together? And with everything else going on, is this really the best time to court romance? The film is jam packed and overstuffed. Unfortunately, though, as much of the humor falls flat as hits its mark.Leo, as always, is a great actress. She does have a tendency to go big, and I prefer her more grounded and realistic. Her performance wavers between sublime and grating. Anytime the cast gets into the car, for example, you know that much shouting will ensue and whoever is driving will veer around like a mad man or woman. This happens several times and is never particularly humorous. Eisenberg is more consistently believable, although the film never digs beneath the surface of his character. Morgan is fine and Isiah Whitlock Jr (as Morgan's brother and muscle) ends up my favorite character because he never plays to the rafters with an oversized performance. There is plenty to like in ""Why Stop Now?"" and if you're a fan of either of the leads, you might want to check this out. However, the picture never came together as a cohesive whole for me. I ended up liking some of the drama, but the chaotic madness never quite worked for my taste. KGHarris, 12/12.",1355011200,2012-12-09

5.0,"What a pleasure! As a kid in the '70s I loved Niekro and Hough and the knuckleball in general. It felt like a pitch from another dimension, with its own laws and mystique, and this film confirms those thoughts and adds so much more depth to a pitch seen as a trick by many. It's a beautifully made documentary with a heartfelt love of the game, and a quiet sense of humor befitting its stars.It focuses on present-day knucklers Wakefield and Dickey but also includes the other five best-known purveyors of this unique pitch. It's no surprise to see how humble they all are, as the film points out that the knuckleball is often the last stop before retirement for most who throw it, and few have ever thrown it well. Most of those who have are here, and they're all fascinating individuals united by their common joy in throwing a ball as softly and wobbly as they can.It's their love and even reverence for baseball and its myriad peccadillos that make this film so special, because nothing in any ball game is odder than the non-rotating, dipsy-doodling path of a properly tossed knuckleball. The filmmakers weave a fine tale of the pitch's history with tight edits and sweet seques that made me feel like I was back in the '70s watching games in Fenway and Yankee Stadium, where I saw some real corkers (if few good knucklers). Because baseball players and especially pitchers last longer than most team athletes, most of these guys were in their thirties and even forties when they tossed their best, and that age gives and gave them a special perspective and gratitude that one rarely sees these days, let alone in pro athletes.Just as good as the film are the extras, two hours of excellent stuff on many related topics, including longer interviews with the pitchers, discussions of the physics of the knuckleball, and lots more fun stuff for any baseball lover. I really enjoyed watching Bouton pitch at a wall in his country home's yard; you can see he loves to throw the pill as much as he ever did, which reminds one that baseball really is the most one of a kind of all professional sports and that it inspires the same love of the game in its players as it does in its fans, a love that never dies.I can't recommend this film highly enough to any sports fan. It's a complete winner, and its subjects are such total gentlemen that it really does feel like an honor to be taken into their lives for a few hours.Cheers and thanks to all of them for daring to throw the ball at 65 mph and watch some of the best hitters of all time fall all over themselves swinging like mad at it. I've avoided the inevitable metaphors so far, but in closing it must be said that in the world of baseball movies, Knuckleball floats across the plate nice and slow, wobbling just above knee high and making the competition look like amateurs.Steeee-rike three!",1367452800,2013-05-02
4.0,"Interesting concept.  The parts I liked best were when the Prima Donna QB was read the Riot Act about who owned his rights, and the final scene where she told the Owners to kiss her perfect a**.",1392854400,2014-02-20
3.0,"CENTURION (2010, 97 minutes) is a fine endless battle-and-chase-and-battle-and-final-gigantic-showdown-battle Roman-era film. That is, if you like this sort of meaningless tripe action film. Set in 117 A.D., and as always centering on the mysteriously vanished 9th Legion, Michael Fassbender actually gives an unusually riveting performance as Centurion Quintus Dias. That's right, they gave him a Spanish name that probably wasn't even in existence yet, but Romans will be Romans in whatever century they occupy.Of course, as I translate the only-half-authentic Roman name, it is symbolic: I narrowed its translation to either a literal ""Five Days"" or the much more humorous, symbolic ""Days [are] Numbered"". An even funnier way to read it is ""How Many Days"" and I assume that should end with a question mark. Yep. ""Quintus Dias"" does it to me every time.Here, north of Hadrian's then-new wall, Dias and only a few others survive horrific, gore-laced battles with the Picts (who amazingly speak modern Irish Gaelic, right down to the Anglicized mispronunciations, instead of speaking Pictish, which language is a mystery to us anyway).I began laughing as they were haunted and hunted by a vicious, supernatural Pictish woman called Etaine (wrongly credited as ""Etain"", a Goth makeup nightmare by the name of Olga Kurylenko). Those ladies were tough fighters but they weren't like this. This lady mows down Romans as if they were Legos.There isn't much for me to add to this. There are just too many other films running along these lines, such as the equally ghastlyKing Arthur(2004, see my review),300(2006), the excellent family filmThe Last Legion(2007, see my review) and the equally excellent and underratedThe Eagle(2011, see my review). Of these, THE EAGLE and THE LAST LEGION are by far the finest.I was very impressed by the beautiful Imogen Poots who plays Arianne, the outcaste Pictish witch. Actually she is a healer who got the bad end of the stick - much like Dias will discover he's getting from the Empire after he gets back home. Though here agin a major stumble, since she is altogether far too reminiscent of Sam Neill inMerlin (Special Edition)(see my review).One thing I can say I am heartily sick of seeing is the set of common refrains running through these films (I back down from 300 because I have no time for a film like that): you can always count on stupid anachronisms galore, phony Celtic peoples (""Hey, why not make 'em all Irish?""), a Roman on a stupid quest, other colorful foreigners fighting with the Roman on his stupid quest, badly spoken Gaelic or Gobbledygook, Ice Age weather, very bad history overall, vast oceans of blood, violent battles that go on too long and finally, Romans deciding Britain is the pure land and defecting from the Empire.Oh, and let us not forget Hadrian's Wall, which is a bit like the obligatory pratfall in every comedy. It is poetic, a little bit of it is occasionally true - for the most part it is a repetitive bore to see that stuff repeated ad nauseam. Hey! Maybe they should have named Fassbender's Roman soldier Ad Nauseam. Better than Your Days Are Numbered.My recommendation is you watch the other films I mentioned before you see this one. You may find once you've seen a bit of it that you don't want to waste your time watching regurgitations. Then again, you just might develop a bit of a soft spot in your heart for this thing, as I did.It was the really good Roman-era Arthurian film (THE LAST LEGION) and the stunning quasi-gay-Roman-plus-Celt-love story (THE EAGLE) that created that soft spot. Only, I hope it doesn't turn out to be a softness in my head!",1347753600,2012-09-16

4.0,"""The Motel Life""(Cinedigm/Random Media, 2014). . . .Fans of crime fiction of the ""lowlife"" variety may be drawn to this bleak yet compelling story of two long-orphaned, hard-luck brothers who move from motel to motel, failure to failure, agony to agony, slowly spiraling downward past the margins of society into a claustrophobic world bounded by despair on one side, and dreams on the other. While on the run from the law, brother Jerry Lee asks his brother Frank to ""tell me a story,"" and these flights of fantasy, suffused with crazy sex and comicbook adventure, are the dreams that keep them alive. In one grim, yellowed motel room after another they struggle, caught between possible redemption and ultimate collapse.The live-action narrative is creatively punctuated by animated sequences based on the fantasy stories, and these bold, lurid vignettes give this indie outing a unique feel. The movie is quite depressing, and offers viewers only the window into a world of hope - for some folks, though, that will have to be enough.

5.0,"Wow, I love this show.  There is suddenly a big influx of fun, original shows and this is one of them.  It's so cool and addictive and I'm hooked now.Minnie Driver is fantastic as Dahlia Malloy who is part of a family of con artists.  She is on parole from having served time in prison for petty robbery and larceny.  Her and her husband Wayne are now on the move with their three kids.  They're travelling in an RV when they are witness to a car crash, and making a long story short, they end up assuming the identities of a wealthy family, the Riches, and move to an upscale neighborhood in Palm Beach Florida.  Wayne needs to find work to support the family's new lifestyle so his first scam begins when he tries for a job with his neighbor at his law firm.I can't tell you in words just how good this is.

3.0,"While not as much fun as the other seasons, it is still worth a watch. The kid honestly needs to go away from the show, him being proped up by family money, close contact with a real miner, and the show make it a little un-realistic. He acts like your typical 19 year old brat. (from what the blogs say he is even worse off camera, the show edits out some of the truly big tantrums.)As for the Hoffmans, they tried something new. There south America trip was abysmal so far. A new climate none of them where prepared to deal with. The heavy equipment they brought, actually is not an asset in the jungle mud. They brought a ton of very heavy gold mining equipment great for alaska, but in the jungles of South America, it is just too heavy to function, they constantly get stuck in the mud, literally.Dokota boys. Well they work hard, and do the best with the land they have. I am convinced of all the miners FRED is the most experienced, and if he had a bigger claim he would be the most successful.

5.0,"This just won an emmy and that finally provoked me into watching it. Before this, a series based on this burly stand up comic simply did not entice me. It has taken a few episodes for me to warm up to this but I must admit that he hits at least one big essential truth in each episode. The comedy is dark.  He is less likely to have a good relationship than Jerry Seinfeld as his stand up series character, which is saying something.In this first episode the woman he is currently seeing figures out he wants to break up and basically does all the hard work for him. As she keeps doing everything for him, you realize how inept he is at relationships. Then in other episodes we see him make behavioral zig zags just because someone says he might be gay.  He isn't but he talks in his stand up comedy act about how straight men will go to almost any lengths to prove they are not gay whereas women could care less about whether someone thinks they are a lesbian.  He makes his case very believably and I did not previously realize how true this was.His daughters ask why he doesn't have a girlfriend and very shortly he is scouting for a girlfriend he can introduce them to at a dinner.  He ends up with a bookstore owner who on the first date proves to be the craziest woman he has every dated. This is played very well by Parker Posey.this show can stand on its own among the sitcom like of SEINFELD and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, which is high praise indeed.",1349481600,2012-10-06

5.0,"Storage Wars is an awesome TV show. It's a very fast pace show and it gets right down with the premise in every show. It works!In every show does the same thing will happen. You see all the same characters going around looking in storage units and bidding on the units if they like them. Then, after auction, you find out what they bought exactly in the units. Sometimes they getting their money back, sometimes they losing money, or sometimes they make a profit. That's it! You going to see this exact same thing in every show. But it's so good because everyone loves watching to seeing what they bought in each unit. Then, finding out if they were right or not before buying the unit.I think this shows makes more and more people come out and try to do what these people do in the show. They try to go out and bid on the units themselves, but we usually won't see other people bid and win a storage from the stars of this show. It does happen but we don't usually see that.

2.0,"I really like the TV show ""Dark Minds.""  It's one of those rare shows that I really look forward to the next episode, kind of like ""The X Files"" a long time ago, at least before that show went off the rails in its last couple of seasons.  I really like the interplay between M. William Phelps and John Kelly; I always get a really good chuckle when 13, or Raven, makes some mysterious comment and either the author or profiler looks up at the other in dismay.I just read part of a review, written by Raven, of the show ""The Following.""  Now, for those of you who haven't seen ""Dark Minds,"" Raven is the pseudonym of the real-life serial killer who helps Mr. Phelps and Mr. Kelly during profiling sessions.  Raven is now behind bars, but he is allowed 15 minutes a call, to give an opinion on some unsolved crime.  Now, if anyone knows what he's talking about when it comes to serial killers, it would be Raven.  After all, practice makes perfect.  And evidently, he's had a lot of practice.  And I was very happy to see that Raven hates ""The Following"" nearly as much as I.I watched the first episode of ""The Following"" and only made it through the first half.  Raven turned it off after 40 minutes.  To me, the biggest problem with this faade-of-a-serial-killer-show:  everyone is in constant crisis mode.  The real world doesn't work this way.  People have down time; they drink coffee every once in a while!  But watching Kevin Bacon -- and his coworkers here -- you'd think they're all on speed.  Man, I say:  kick it down a notch every once in a while!  There are other issues, but this issue alone is sufficient to make me change the channel.One issue that I had with Raven's analysis:  he said that serial killers don't engage the police.  Now, that is usually the case; most serial killers are smart enough to avoid attention.  However, what about killers such as Zodiac?  He is one of quite a few that seemed to enjoy toying with the police.  But otherwise, I liked Ravens critique of ""The Following,"" a show that I won't be following at all, just like Raven.But I will be following ""Dark Minds.""  I guess the season ends this week.  Bummer.  Well, I can watch one more show and then I'll have to wait until fall for the next episode.  I'd recommend following ""Dark Minds,"" and dumping ""The Following"" from your queue.  You won't be following unwatchable TV that way.",1366070400,2013-04-16

5.0,Great acting awesome story etc. I find it funny as well as tricky all at the same time. The more I watch the more I discover. Amazing story line and cannot wait for season 2. I find it a step above dexter because it was produced with less awkward scenes and more artistically written like a modern day Hitchcock mystery.,1391904000,2014-02-09

3.0,"Here is another Terrence Malick film, following ""The Tree of Life"" only made one year before. Reportedly, ""To the Wonder"" is, like his previous effort, a semi-autobiographical movie of the director fiercely protective of his private life. Here Ben Affleck plays Neil, an American travelling in Europe, who falls in love with a recently divorced Ukrainian mother of one daughter Marina played by Olga Kurylenko. Meanwhile, Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), respected priest losing his faith.Though ""To the Wonder"" benefits from the poetic beauty of the images thanks to photographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who worked for the director's ""The New World"" and ""The Tree of Life""), the film itself remains an impressionistic collection of images. We are supposed to look behind these images and find something, while honestly I am not sure it's worth trying.I know Terrence Malick's unique filmmaking style, and I love his earlier work ""Days of Heaven,"" which offers a simple but intriguing story. In this newest film, what the director does with fragmentary images may be unconventional, but what happens in the film, if derived of its showy styles, is pretty conventional, even banal, together with the dull voiceovers. To me, ""To the Wonder"" is frustratingly pretentious and self-indulgent.I think I know ""To the Wonder"" is trying to do. It's about the feeling and emotion envisioned by the director. But people just don't cry or laugh. There is a context in which those emotions are expressed, and usually dialogue, story or character development provides that context, which the film refuses to do. This may have worked with other material, but if it's a love story, which is a very personal thing, well, I don't think so.",1377820800,2013-08-30
5.0,This was a great show. Clearly not all agreed as it wasn't renewed for the 2013/2014 season. Perhaps the audience is limited. We love live theater and have two kids who perform locally. We found found a lot to relate to and loved the &#34;insider&#34; backstage view.,1371600000,2013-06-19
5.0,"My wife and I really look forward to each new episode of season 2.Great to see the chemistry between Joan Watson and Holmes develop. Lucy Lui has martial arts training and the writers are starting to bring out her abilities to defend herself.Very much like that Watson is not just a foil for Holmes as with older versions of Holmes dramas. The clever and strange story lines often have the flavor of the original Holmes stories but with many a new twist.This story line moves away from the typical Holmes drama where Holmes is always the only smart, logical, insightful person on the case. Here Holmes demonstrates that analytical thinking, problem/crime solving can be taught if you have a willing and bright pupil. It flows naturally because Lucy Lui, as Watson, has all the skills from her previous profession as a caring surgeon and is now learning to redirect her gifts to solving crimes.Since Lui has some martial arts training in real life, I am sure we will see her demonstrate her skills in this area more often. (She already did in a previous episode)As a technical problem solver myself, I find this a subtle form of education for the audience. Yes, you too can become an rational thinker, a problem solver if you put your mind to it!And the world really needs more rational thinkers, now, more than ever!Also enjoy the BBC Sherlock series and look forward to its second season also.",1381622400,2013-10-13

5.0,"Being a fan of Betty White's, I'm happy that they brought my beloved Golden Girl to the show.  She makes an excellent, crazy, and horrifying witch lady.  I hope I've seen all the episodes now.  I recall a few months earlier when I was surfing TV late night when I saw Betty White in the description for this show.  I've been hooked on it ever since.  TBS re-aired the episode, so hopefully I'm now all caught up.  Too bad that the show was cancelled fairly early on.  I really did like the simple lessons that Earl gave.Honorable mention: I love Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop name.  It always puts a smile on my face.Earl is just as naive as ever in this episode.Joy is just as bitchy as ever.Darnel is just as ""nice"" as ever.Randy is just as simple as ever.Kenny is just as gay as ever.Catalina is just as cuckoo as ever.and ex-deputy Mike is just as lackadaisical as ever.I love the creativity of the writers - this show is hilarious with all the funny flashbacks.

5.0,"Season 3 of The Walking Dead simply blew two out of the water, if you ignore the very very lackluster finale. That was the only disappointment to an otherwise wonderful season.

4.0,"Just good not get interested in it though the actress is phenomenal and one of my favorite.  I gave it until half way through the second episode.  Probably would have been better as a movie.  That being said, the acting is great; the scenes are good; but, the plot goes on and on without capturing me.  I cannot say that I won't go back to the series, but at this time there are a lot of ole authors, shows, and series to catch up on.",1406073600,2014-07-23
5.0,"A man phones a lawyer and asks, ""How much would you charge for just answering three simple questions?""The lawyer replies, ""A thousand dollars.""""A thousand dollars!"" exclaims the man. ""That's very expensive isn't it?""""It certainly is,"" says the lawyer. ""Now, what's your third question?""Or this one...Q: What do you have if three lawyers are buried up to their necks in cement?A: Not enough cement.The USA network keeps on not effing up. Far as I'm concerned, SUITS is the newest addictive show on television, and that's me not normally drawn to legal dramas. It's witty and funny and smart and loaded with that patented easy-breezy sense of fun that the USA network nowadays specializes in. The premise is irresistible, the cast is irrepressible. The two leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams, are so very good. I can't not rave.SUITS chronicles the exploits of the prestigious New York corporate law firm Pearson Hardman. More pointedly, the catchy premise revolves around sleek newly-made senior partner Harvey Specter (Macht) who dips into shady shenanigans when he takes under his wing a college dropout who was running away from the law when he happened to stumble across Harvey's office just when Harvey was in the middle of interviewing first year associates. Turns out, there's more to Mike Ross (Adams) than just being a slacker and a weed merchant. Mike boasts an eidetic memory. He reads something, he understands it. Once he understands it, he never forgets it. It's a neat party trick. It intrigues Harvey enough, impresses him enough, that he decides to gamble on Mike. And since Pearson Hardman only ever hires from a pool of Harvard law graduates, then begins the big fib of Mike Ross, Harvey's new associate and recent Harvard alumni.Mike Ross is a resourceful, idealistic cat (that whole weed thing was a one-time mistake). He makes for a terrific point-of-view character. As he navigates his way around his new environment, as he learns, we learn. Will Mike sink or swim in these shark-infested waters? That's part of the fun. In just about each episode, Mike is thrown a curve, is put in a situation in which he could get exposed. Sometimes, his quick thinking and his immaculate sense of recall get him out of predicament. Sometimes, Harvey, cool as the other side of the pillow, steps in. How long can these two keep up the charade? The show dares you to step away.Macht, gleam all wicked in his eye and so much hair gel the headrest of his Barcalounger is afraid, embodies Harvey Specter with supreme swagger, cocky and ruthless and unruffled. Once in a blue moon he exhibits his (begrudgingly) compassionate side. Harvey is touted as the firm's go-to closer, its most heralded gunslinger. In his competitive field, it's no surprise that his colleagues are resentful. And maybe none more envious than the always scheming junior partner Louis Litt (that fabulous gopher Rick Hoffman). Hoffman is great as the perennial burr in the saddle. He quickly makes Mike's time in the firm a partly sucky one. Mike becomes the human rope in Harvey and Louis' ongoing game of tug-of-war.Q: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer?A: His partners.Let me fragment sentence you: Predatory boardroom sharks, cooly preening and posturing and bedeviling clients with silver tongues, and yet graced with just enough of that bump of conscience to humanize them. I found myself suckered into that simmer between Mike and sexy, five-year paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle). I relish the hell out of Sarah Rafferty who plays Harvey's sassy secretary Donna, and we note Donna's understated pining for her boss. In fact, the interactions among the cast members are absorbing all around. Gina Torres as the firm's steely managing (and founding) partner is the icing on the cake. The cases handled by Harvey and Mike are watchable enough, and the legalese thrown at us is made decipherable enough. For those trying to become better people, morals and ethics are explored intelligently. Each time I side with Mike's naive nice guy perspective, Harvey extends a counter-argument which sheds a new light on the matter. My favorite moments are those in which Harvey sarcastically mentors Mike (with Mike frequently giving as good as he gets) and those moments in which Mike scrambles to maintain his Harvard cover. And I don't mind at all any scene in which the weasely Louis Litt gets what's coming to him. And let me reiterate: SUITS is FUNNY. I'm already 5 episodes deep into Season 2, and, if anything, I've gotten even more hooked. In Season 2, the stakes have shot up even more. As for Season One, get it. Get it now.The SUITS DVD set contains all twelve episodes of Season One and comes in three discs and with the following bonus stuff:- Pilot Extended Version- Audio Commentaries on 2 episodes: the pilot episode and the season finale ""Dogfight"" (both eps with exec. producer David Bartis, creator/co-exec. producer Aaron Korsh, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams)- Deleted Scenes for 7 episodes- Gag Reel (00:04:13 minutes)- ""Cross Examination"": Gabriel Macht, Meghan Markle, Patrick J. Adams, Rick Hoffman, Aaron Korsh and David Bartis sit down to a Q & A session (00:10:29 minutes)Okay, last one:Q: What do you get when you cross a bad politician with a crooked lawyer?A: Chelsea Clinton.",1343347200,2012-07-27

The only annoying part about the second season is that Laural is terrible...literally, all she does is sit on the couch, drinking wine, and moping about how everyone doesn't design their life to best suit her. I'm serious, in pretty much every scene after the first few episodes, she's sitting on a couch like a whiny teenager. So annoying and so useless, especially compared to the first season were she actually did things other than be an alcoholic.",1393459200,2014-02-27

5.0,"Patrick Jane follows his usual ritual of starting a homicide investigation at a victim's home, by going into their kitchen and making a cup of tea. As he drinks the tea and watches a monarch butterfly land on white orchids, a huge stainless steel pot on the kitchen stove begins to rattle. Inside Jane finds a rabbit with a diamond necklace around its neck. The rabbit escapes and Jane follows it into a gorgeous flower and maze garden, where a beautiful young girl claims the rabbit for her own. She also claims to be Charlotte, Jane's murdered daughter. Later Jane wakes up in a hospital bed and realizes he has been hallucinating.  But he is determined to go back to the crime scene and solve the case - even if Charlotte continues to follow him. The murder itself was vicious and the culprit is definitely one of the more horrific murderers presented in the series. This episode was comedic in some places, but the ending with Jane in his rooftop hideaway at CBI headquarters sipping tea is gut wrenching.",1350000000,2012-10-12

4.0,"This film opened and disappeared quickly in the DFW area, so I'm certainly glad I caught up to it via Blu ray.  A first time director (J Blakeson) puts together a taut thriller using only 3 actors and a minimalist set...not to mention a minimalist plot, albeit filled with twists and turns.  Alice, a 20 something lass is the daughter of a rich businessman somewhere in England.  She is kidnapped and taken to a well prepared (soundproofing, locks, etc.) apartment to wait for an eventual ransom.  Alice is played by Gemma Arterton whose previous credits include eye candy roles in ""The Prince of Persia"" and ""Clash of the Titans"".  She's something else here.The girl can act as well as look good.  In a demeaning, vulnerable role, she is stripped naked, force to pee in a bottle, tied to a bed and ruthlessly gagged with one of those ball-in-the-mouth things that sex dominatrix like to use.  It's fun to figure out what's going on because we suspect Alice is familiar with one of the kidnappers.  So really, what's going on? Yes, a big surprise. Even after we find this out, our questions aren't answered.  The film is filled with tension and is certainly an obscure gem of a picture.",1322438400,2011-11-28

4.0,"Four stars why? The plot is not that spectacular. The pilot of the show was brilliant, wildly inventive, well acted for the most part.The reason why I would give this show four comes down to &#34;Harvey Spector, Louis Litt and the pot smoking apprentice. Louis Litt I found especially appealing and authentic in his own weaselly, ingratiating and venal way, chased with a side of self awareness and jabs at redemption. Spector comes across as one dimensional- the episode where he meets up with a lost love I found totally unconvincing. But still, the panache with which he delivers the biting sarcasm of some of his best lines is oiled smooth precision and that doesn't come cheap. As for the apprentice, whose name I forget, the portrayal is honest and as sublime as one's going to get in the show. For the rest of them, pretty much cutouts with plot lines well confined to the specifics of a law office, I presume. Knowing atmosphere flows pretty well on the show, also.",1366761600,2013-04-24

5.0,"Season three of SUITS, the very intelligent and well written and acted series now advertises on the USA network during the show that viewers can follow it on Amazon Video on Demand - quite a coups for Amazon and a remainder to those who miss parts of the season on television can still keep up the tension by turning to Amazon!The initial show truly requires that the viewer watch a rerun on the last show of Season 2 because a lot is happening the now Pearson Hardy law firm.  There are changes in offices, coping with the new British partners, blossoming love affairs, and the same degree of backstabbing and secrecy of negotiations that makes this show tick. Returning are, of course, Gabriel Macht as Harvey Spector an dhis sidekick `non-lawyer' lawyer Patrick J. Adams as Mike Ross, the dark blot that is making some changes in his personality traits Rick Hoffman as Louis Litt, and of course the beautiful ladies of the firm - Meghan Markle as Rachel Zane (now in a full blown love affair with Mike Ross), Sarah Rafferty as everybody's favorite secretary Donna Paulsen, and the queen bee Gina Torres as Jessica Pearson.  New characters have been added that tend to confuse the flow of the storyline a bit, but in all this first show suggests that SUITS will be a challenge again this year.

1.0,"If you want to watch CSI Miami, season 10, I recommend you avoid the DVD version and upgrade to Blu-Ray now as the TV studios obviously want.  The picture quality of TV on DVD is on a downward slide for many series.  The TV studios are deliberately shipping DVD discs with inferior video to kill the format and to make Blu-Ray look better than it is.  Here, the DVDs are so blurry I can't watch them.  I CAN'T SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING!  I own most, possibly all seasons of CSI Miami on DVD; the early seasons are fine, 10 is a visual mess.SEA HUNT Season One on DVD 1958 *underwater* has sharper picture quality than CSI MIAMI Season Ten DVDs.  I'm not joking: if you don't believe me, check it for yourself!  CBS wants us on Blu-Ray.I have yet up upgrade my viewing to Blu-Ray; but there may also be another factor at play.  Remember first generation STAR TREK, where the close-up shots of the sexy female guest star would be shot through a lens that made her look sexier by blur?  David Caruso would look like a wrinkled grandfather if Blu-Ray did a high-resolution close-up on his face; and Emily Procter is also getting up there in years.  I suspect a state-of-the-art optical lens during shooting supplies just the right blur for the Blu-Ray discs to obscure the age of the stars, knocking the actual viewing experience back down into the DVD realm; but the studio can't ship the exact same viewing experience on both DVD and Blu-Ray discs, so the studio adds an additional digital blur to the DVD discs.Can you say, time for a Class Action Suit?@hg47",1356739200,2012-12-29

4.0,"The Fringe team, after investigating numerous paranormal crimes, discovering and traveling to an alternate universe and saving the world many times is now traveling in time to a future where the Observers have taken over the world for a purpose as yet unknown. The Fringe team has been seperated for over two decades frozen in amber and unaware of what is happening in the world. Olivia and Peter's daughter was raised as an orphan in this totalitarian new world where humans are little better than slaves. The overall arc is how to beat the Observers and put the timeline back to its original shape.In this episode, Walter, as usual, has the beginnings of a solution but has hidden it in beta tapes that are scattered around the country, a country where humans are no longer free to travel, but the team sets out anyway and discovers a group of people, who are recording humanity's true history in the face of extinction. Clues are found, sacrifices are made and the season long arc is added to. A solid episode of Fringe and an interesting reinvention for one of television's most surreal sci-fi shows. Recommended.

5.0,"NBC's CHUCK is such a welcome surprise and one of the best and funniest TV shows I've seen in a while, something which normally is an omen for immediate cancellation (but, thankfully, NBC picked it up for the full season). CHUCK achieves that heady mix of humor, action, espionage, and even a dash of romance (or pining, to be more exact). And it'll have you rooting for the nerd hero Chuck Bartowski, the physically hapless but nonetheless invaluable new member of the U.S. secret agent fraternity. Whereas, before, Chuck was someone who for thrills lived life vicariously thru video games and films, he's all of a sudden forced to cope with experiencing the very intense real thing.Several SPOILERS follow.The 411 on the premise and plot: A rogue CIA agent, just before being killed, downloads a wealth of top secret government files into the brain of his old college roommate Chuck Bartowski, a seemingly disastrous choice at first blush. Chuck is a social misfit, a computer geek who toils at the Nerd Herd electronics department of the Buy More supermarket. His support system consists of his best bud Morgan, who's even more of a loser than Chuck, and Chuck's lovely, protective sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster), who is perpetually concerned for him and his lack of a social life. That Chuck lives with Ellie and her laid back boyfriend, Captain Awesome, doesn't exactly win him points with the cool set. But, for Chuck, things are about to change.Chuck meets Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), who seems to really like him. But Sarah is really a CIA agent sent to wrest the stolen intel from him. Finding out that the top secret data is imbedded in his noggin, she is then assigned to keep tabs on him. To do so, Sarah works at Wienerlicious and poses as Chuck's chica. Meanwhile, the NSA trots out its top operative, the no-nonsense John Casey (the awesome Adam Baldwin), who as cover hires on as a Buy More sales clerk.Nowadays, danger and intrigue lurk at every corner for Chuck Bartowski, who finds himself leading a double life and is now sometimes referred to as the Intersect (mostly by Casey). He speedily proves his value when the data in his brain enables him to put two and two together and uncover an assassination attempt. Soon, he's tangling with ninjas, shadowy agents, terrorists, and bombs - and that's just in the first episode. Further shows would unveil even greater peril and more mystery. Seeds of distrust are sown as Chuck also struggles with the constant hedging and fabrication brought on by his CIA and NSA minders. More importantly, despite obstacles put up by his nemesis, the evil Asian dude Harold Tang (okay, he's not really evil...but he's bald), Chuck's trying out for the assistant manager gig at the Buy More. Good luck, Chuck.End SPOILERS.CHUCK is a consistently funny, funny show doubling as a straight-up spy thriller. There are plenty of slick, potent action sequences, but the heart of the series is the comic fish-out-of-water premise of the geek caught in serious cloak-and-dagger environs. The show provides a steady dosage of nerd/slacker humor which always has me smiling for the duration of the episodes. And, instead of Chuck suddenly developing kung fu skills, the series makes sure that Chuck remains inept and a bit cowardly (Chuck would prefer to refer to it as being ""prudent""). Zachary Levi as Chuck is wonderfully straight-faced yet has that comic timing down pat. He's very sympathetic as a guy whose big heart is shyly on his sleeve.Which leads us to another focal point of the show: Chuck's tentative relationship with the beautiful Sarah, who as a spy is forever on her guard and who's still grieving over her recent past with a fellow agent. But there's a connection between her and our favorite Nerd Herder, as Sarah realizes that Chuck really is a most decent dude. But only time will tell if it pans out. Australian Yvonne Strahovski is well cast as the lethal and accomplished secret agent, who can kick enemy agent heinie even a she dances sensuously with a clueless partner (yes, that would be Chuck). Yet Strahovski, when called for, can lend a torn, vulnerable air to her calculating superspy (check out ""Chuck versus the Nemesis"" to see just how conflicted she becomes). And, holy ministrone, she's hot! On the other hand, I don't think the looming Adam Baldwin is hot, but he's one of my favorite dudes to watch on TV. Fans of Joss Whedon will remember Baldwin from his memorable recurring roles in ANGEL and FIREFLY. Here, he makes for an intimidating sales clerk and government spy.I am currently in solid geek heaven with CHUCK. Here's hoping NBC continues to support this show for a busload of seasons. Here's to Chuck (and friends) waging war against irate Buy More patrons, staving off calculating co-workers, and also fending off some of the most diabolical enemies of America, mom, and apple pie. And all that while shouldering the stigma of a dead-end job. Way to go, Chuck!",1206144000,2008-03-22
5.0,"This will probably be one of Billy Bob Thornton's final films as he has stated publicly that he is pretty much done with making films at this time in his life. I'm sorry to see him retire, but he certainly has left us with a wonderful legacy of films that are &#34;a little different&#34; than the usual fare. This is one of those films.There's a lot of violence in this film, right from the start, but it isn't gratuitous violence. The seemingly obvious plot soon reveals some very unexpected twists and surprises, which is great fun. Thornton isn't one of the main characters, but he is certainly unforgettable as a murderous, power-hungry tycoon who has diverse groups of thugs at his beck and call.The real stars of the film are the seemingly rotten-to-the-core brothers who will do anything for money. They set out to do a high-paying job for Thornton, but they are transformed when they learn the job is the kidnapping of a young man who has severe mental and physical disabilities. This transformation is great to watch. Don't get me wrong, the movie doesn't turn mushy as the carnage keeps things rolling at the pace of a roller coaster.The acting is excellent, as is the script. I saw this without having any idea what it was about, just looking for another good Thornton film ... and I definitely found one here. I ended up buying it as well.",1393459200,2014-02-27

4.0,"I'm a fan of the Michael Mann ""Manhunter"" and I really enjoyed the casting changes for the Dr. Bloom and Freddie Lounds characters; I think the latter is based on E Jean Carroll circa 1983.  This is a very well-shot show - better than Twin Peaks though there are some similarities.  This show is awash in urban grey blues sort of metallic.Mads Mikkelson is awesome to watch.  I really hate him now.  He's really making Hannibal Lecter look very mean, silently petty and sadistic.The bodies in every episode are very shocking and disgusting.  There have been two episodes that were ugly and boring.  There haven't been any scenes that have made me keep an episode on my dvr until the latest one when we are SHOWN more of Hannibal's seething beneath the surface - it's Gillian Anderson's first appearance and she's always a disturbing casting choice to me so it feels right that she is cast in this disturbing show.I surprisingly don't mind Hugh Dancy in the this role  - he has this flat, phd voice that he must enjoy using since he is English.  I think Mads Mikkelson is using his own accent.The set design on this show is sophisticated and a relief from the usual stock images - think Grimm and how every Portland interior looks/feels the same and probably used the same can of paint.Mads Mikkelson's scenes create a handbook of caution - they should be stitched together into one movie.  It is so dangerous to be on his radar.  You can't win with someone like that.",1368576000,2013-05-15

3.0,"The movie itself is good, but the story has been done before from a hit film in the 1980's.  If the story was original or at least from an obscure forgotten novel or episode than I would have given it five stars.[pjt]",1311984000,2011-07-30
1.0,"Ohmy. I used to think that the brand J.J. Abrams meant something good. Now I guess it means that he is being well paid to put his name behind even beyond bad products. Like this. There is not a single redeeming quality that excuses this disaster. The general plot is so bad, repetitive, and predictable as are the plots of each episode. Having a cute lovely child as main character doesn't do anything to mitigate the fact that the plot, the dialogues, and the acting are just terrible. Renegade group of scientists / good rebels help little paranormally gifted girl to escape from being used by mean scientist and government as a weapon. She is paired with a man wrongfully accused of murder, who is rescued from his own execution (an absolutely unnecessary ""plot twist"" -- faux pas really). This guy is her dad, which you know in about 5 seconds, but he is very very very slow and the only person in the universe for whom it takes a couple of terribly bad episodes to discover the obvious. And even though she controls minds and objects and reads situations and people and changes reality, they are utterly unable of doing anything decently well. Except, of course, being very, but very, really good samaritans (in case the blonde hair illuminated by an unsourced light was too sutil, you might need clues to understand that she is angelical). So, they escape all the time. The little angel and the wrongly persecuted criminal. None of whom should be in the acting career. Let's hope they catch them soon and put an end to our misery.",1397692800,2014-04-17

1.0,"There is no way to shut off the reply function on this review. If there were, I would.If you are the kind of person who is easily offended or wants to slam an individual for having an opinion that doesn't follow along with the masses, then don't read this. There are other reviews better suited to you. DeeLam and Lee make excellent points for how great they feel the show is. If you want that, then I strongly recommend you go there. Heck, Shinashi didn't even write a review of the first episode, but she felt so strongly about it that she'll attack total strangers to defend it. I guess if you judge a thing by the company it keeps, then let your eyes be the judge and read on.Just to warn you, if you read this you will probably hate me for it. You will probably formulate ideas about my lack of intelligence and want to reply numerous times telling me how bad a human being I am. Likely, you will want to pick apart every word of my review. It may be an attempt to mirror how ""harsh"" one person called this review, or how ""brutal"" another dubbed its author. At this point, I don't even care*. I wrote this to offer another opinion besides the hyperbole being showered upon this episode.Finally, this review is for this episode only. I have watched no other episode in the series. This episode was bad enough that I could not follow it any further. I'm sure you'll want to attack me for that too.I am not writing this to attack or offend anyone... except maybe TLOK. If you feel like my perspective is faulty, ignorant, or just plain belligerent, I don't care*. If you don't even care what I have to say, but want to bash ME for making the comment, I don't care*. If you are a parent just looking for a show for your kids to watch, eh, this will keep them entertained. It has lights and motion. Lots of bells and whistles. It's either this or the Backyardigans (although I think the latter is better conceived). Pick your poison.*When I say I don't care, I don't mean that I don't think other opinions are valid. I just think that attacking my opinion as if it were an academic point to be disputed with counter facts laced with subtle and not-so-subtle inferences and implications of my indignity, THAT I don't care about.The review:1) Aang's epic journey in the original show from the village of the Southern Water Tribe to the Fire Nation did not have to end with the defeat of the Fire Lord. There were lots of other aspects of this world and the personal development of the characters that could easily have carried a whole new story arc. Giving up on the characters felt like a betrayal. Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off?2) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender, Zuko's hunt for his exiled mother, along with the mysterious fate of Jet, the budding romances of Aang and Katara, and Sokka and Suki, and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season, a season that would never come.3) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant. This first episode is where the protagonist is supposed to shine, but we are bogged down by repetitive info dumps about characters and plot lines from the original that, other than providing latent back story, have no place in Korra's story. The problem is, the writers were apparently indebted to the fans of the original, and felt inclined to provide a brief synopsis of each element of The Last Airbender that would no longer play a part in this new tale. That was spread out ham-handedly over most of the show. It had the feel of a weak story picking at the bones of a once stronger carcass. If you don't like that analogy, pick your own to suit.4) Aang earned his powers. He did not have to try terribly hard to gain the most potent, if basic, versions of the bending techniques, but when he failed to study he paid for it on several occasions. Korra was instantly given mastery of all the bending schools except Airbending. There is no room for growth if your protagonist is already a powerhouse. Characters who start off near the height of their glory are typically in tragedies, not adventure tales. If Korra is not learning, then she is just throwing around power with no relevance to her development, nor that of the story line. In fact, because she is so powerful, it makes her seem like a whiny brat when she can't learn what she wants exactly when she wants. Her flight to the city is more like the running away tantrum of a baby than an heroic quest.No, Korra's story did not need to follow Aang's exactly, but she should not just have everything handed to her. If she had been a fourth generation decedent, that would have allowed her story to stand alone and would have better explained and justified the change in venue I make a point of next...5) The tech of the original show was driven specifically by the bending power of their creators. Firebenders were able to create heat to power the motors that drove their vehicles. Airbenders used kites to flit over the clouds. Waterbenders surrounded their communities in ice walls, and Earthbenders used stone to implement a mass-transit system for people and cargo. In fact, there was no significant socioeconomic development that did not have it's innermost source in bending. There is a reason why we have the expression, ""necessity is the mother of invention"". If you do not need the improvement, it is unlikely that you will make strides to discover it.All of a sudden, Korra goes to Aang's science city and finds microphones, televisions, cars, printing presses, guns, and all the other conveniences of modern society. Did everyone forget that Aang, Katara, and Sokka used to have to make camp complete with camp fires, bed rolls, and fish they had caught from a stream, as well as protect themselves with swords, boomerangs, and staves?Korra is not that old, and Aang did not appear to be that old when he died. This means that the society's evolutionary jump happened in about a quarter of a lifetime. This would be the equivalent of going from the renaissance era to the late industrial era without any stop in between. Bending cannot account for that, especially when this society seems decidedly anti-bending. If the civilizations that came before Aang, all of which had bending powers, had not come up with this super society, how now brown cow? There were-what, 500 or so Avatars before Aang? None of those guys ever ignited a spontaneous information age.Was Aang secretly sporting a Stephen Hawking level intellect that we just did not know about? It makes no sense.6) These 5 points each have an individual negative impact on the texture of the episode, but when contrasted with the oddly exuberant viewpoints of the other reviewers of this episode make one final sixth point, a sort of conspiracy theorist's coffee table distraction if you will. How do you make such a crap-tastic product and find yourself fully stocked with rave reviews? Well, corporations that create profiles on Facebook hire ""Facebook Developers"" to add 2 or 3 hundred thousand ""likes"" to their brands to increase faith in their products. To me, it seems like such a poor product as The Legend of Korra, Episode 1 generating such miraculous reviews is blatantly serendipitous. If you are the author of one of these reviews and take exception to this suggestion, it is merely that. I don't care if it is true or not. I merely point all of this out to highlight the following advice:Think for yourself. Watch the episode with an open mind like I did. If you think it's the best thing you ever saw, ""like"" it on facebook! If you think it sucked like I did, be careful should you place a review that states this. You may just be painting a target on your back, again, like I did. Don't let people TELL you what to like, when to laugh, or to accept their hackneyed writing pell-mell.",1336694400,2012-05-11
2.0,"I caught this after the first season and watched it from start to finish.  How many ways can to do a story about a dome? It seems the writers got tired and just started making s*** up.  Example?  the entire series they said Barbie was the 'Monarch'  The butterfly flies around him twenty minutes and everyone says he is the one...THEN??? It flys over to his girlfriend and now out of the blue it was her all along???  Give me a break... Soooo stupid.  Then the character shifts at one minutes characters are good then they in the next episode are bad then good again.  Sometimes in the same episode!  I find this tiring and simply manipulative.  Make your people good or evil and stick to your story line! It seems they have a bunch of twenty somethings doing the writing and they cannot hold a thought for more than ten seconds.  In conclusion sloppy writing, tedious dragged out plot, and after thirteen episodes we still do nto know why the dome came or what it is for.",1374451200,2013-07-22

4.0,"It's unfortunate that this worthwhile Irish film has nearly the same title as the currently popular Twilight Saga ""Eclipse"" series about vampires. It might get overlooked in the confusion of titles. This is all the more unfortunate because the title ""Eclipse"" doesn't seem particularly apt to the traces of ghostly influence here. The film could so easily and so much more accurately have been given some other title, something referring to the wedding gown train of lost love.Actually, this movie was based on a short story that was strictly about a widower's life in the wake of his wife's death from cancer. The short story had no ghostly elements at all. These were only added for the sake of boosting cinematic and box office appeal. And it shows. The brief appearances of actual ghosts here are often alarming, menacing, downright shocking, and so are at war with the general mood of this film. The film's essential theme is the possibility of finding another mature, tender love after one has suffered the loss of one's first partner in life. The occasional hair-raising intrusions of apparitions onto the scene are adventitious and unnecessary.The main intended sentiment of the film is beautifully conveyed by the actors. Ciaren Hinds plays his part of the widower with just the right combination of a numbness that closes him off from the world and a longing that opens him up to future possibilities.This is a rare adult love story, in which ""adult"" does NOT mean X-rated - but harkens back to an earlier, more essential meaning of the word ""adult."" Here the two adults express their maturity by being sane, stable individuals who put getting to fondly know each other first and foremost.",1294358400,2011-01-07

5.0,"Viewer be warned, for a legal drama there is really not much in the way of courtroom scenes. It has more to do with the legal process (deposition, finding witnesses, filing motions, etc.).I've been watching this on Netflix instant and was hooked from the first episode. It starts out as a CSI ""Who Dunnit"" approach, showing someone who was murdered followed by a random woman roaming the streets covered in blood. Each episode reveals a piece of the puzzle, until everything makes sense with the final episode and brings you up to speed. By the time you catch up, the season is over and you're amazed they were able to draw you in for so many episodes. And, you want more!The cast is amazing with some heavy hitters. Ted Danson stars as Mr. Frobisher, a multimillionaire businessman who will stop at nothing to keep his money safe. Glenn Close plays Pattie Hughes, a rough and tumble lawyer who has many, many sides to her. Trying to figure her out is darn near impossible. She adapts to anything thrown at her and seems to be one step ahead at almost all times. The second season features Mario Peebles, Timothy Olyphant, William Hurt, and Marcia Gray Harden. There are others I'm sure, I simply do not recognize them.All in all, great series that keeps you captivated and entertained. Watch an episode and see for yourself!",1344211200,2012-08-06

3.0,"Although I watch the first episode with a huge grain of salt (the topic seemed a bit of a clich&eacute; for the sci-fi person), I was immediately caught by the acting, the nuances, flaws, and chemistry of the characters in themselves and interacting with each other. Dorian, the humanoid cop, is fantastic, surprising, and emotionally compelling. His human pal, detective John Kennex, plays well the conflicted, not too good at communicating detective, who is more sensitive, good-hearted, and compassionate than his thick-skinned, damaged cop surface shows. The two of them working together are a pleasure to watch. So are the characters around, all rich and intriguing. Lily Taylor as Captain Maldonado is just royal. Detective Stahl is more than eye candy, and the in house robotics expert played by Mackenzie Crook, is fun. The tough to annoying cop Det Paul, is right on the note as well.The big problem is that while casting and acting are top notch, the writing seems often an afterthought. The fascinating world in which the live is hardly delved with. The terrorist group that has costed Det Kennex his leg, his men, and a broken heart, are not a thing that one can pin down during season 1. The crazy criminals and crimes they pursue are always too superficially addressed. No topic grows or is a thing except the friendship between Dorian and his human colleague. The central topic -- what  is to be human? -- is hardly addressed by anything else than Dorian's moving reactions to some crimes and use of androids by humans. The chances offered by potential conversations between him and others androids (Danika in the finale for instance) are cut by action scenes that often seem too long. The pischo who killed people to get more views for his game was just one more villain to get obsessed with John, as if there were not other humans in the city. The writing is so superficial, inane, and clich&eacute; that you can often write the plot of the entire episode after two or three scenes. A shame. The show has great potential. They should hire people who can make it happen.",1391990400,2014-02-10

2.0,"I have no idea why I watch this show, probably for the same reason people start at train wrecks.  It revolves around this dysfunctional dance teacher, Abby Lee Miller, who, despite her personality flaws, seems to be very good at watch she does because she produces beautiful, winning dances for her competitive dancing team as well as some of her individual dancers. She favors two sisters over the rest of the group.  The older one is definitely talented, but one wonders if she's more successful in competitions because she gets so much more time and attention from Abby than the other girls.  That's mostly because the mother is the typical brown-noser we've all known and disliked at some point in our lives.  The Dance Moms are dysfunctional personalities like Abby.  I don't understand why they have not all (except the one mentioned previously) been arrested for child abuse for exposing their children to Abby's mistreatment.  They are all dumber than boxes of rocks. One even has a Ph.D, but apparently not a lot of common sense. (On one episode, one of the moms didn't know who Ann Frank was).  The moms fight Abby, fight among themselves, fight a competing dance teacher (as does Abby) and the whole thing is really a hot mess.  The main reason I like to watch it is to see the girls dance.  The girls are the best thing about the show. They all seem to be sweet, lovely, and talented, which makes the Moms even more culpable for putting up with the treatment Abby dishes out.  One has to wonder if the money is really worth destroying the self-confidence (which anyone with children can see is happening) of these charming young girls. It makes me glad my daughter was into sports.",1379721600,2013-09-21

Acting so bad the actors could manage only one short emotionless line then pause for the next actor to robotically respond in kind; back and tediously back and forth. Scenes composed of  95% dumbed down dialogue. Other 5% of scenes composed of a superficial attempt to  appear current e.g. tablets, internet video, Samsung product placement phones. Lot of formula characters e.g. dumb act cool cops; surfer dude; party people; lawyer cutouts; etc.Baddd: How bad? I was ff after 10 minutes and checking it every 10 to see if anything changed. Answer - as blandly homogenized as milk.People! For the honest reviewers not financially invested in this movie; if you want to see quality acting, storyline, sets, props and actually have to think, then watch ""The Best Offer"". It may cleanse you of the effects of this film's shallow banality. As far as the ""fanatic-obsessives"" I hope that VM series wasn't a representation of lives (un)productively lived. Let me know.",1399680000,2014-05-10

5.0,"Cancelled after one season? Excellent acting, plot development, plot, and casting it must have hit too close to home for the current administration, and was killed off. Watch it and I think you will agree.",1371340800,2013-06-16
4.0,"With the exception of South Park and the Simpsons, this is the best comedy on TV.  In a world bound by PC and 'standards and practices', it's about the best it can be.  Ms. White is a timeless source of unexpected humor.  You know she's part of the cast, reading a script; yet, her quips come as a surprise.  We just can't accept that older people have a sense of humor and an agile mind.The composite cast is perfect, with Wendy Malick, Valerie Bertineeli, and Jane Leeves as three friends who are constantly at each other's throats...but in a mild, harmless, PC way.The first season was very short but had no filler or bad shows.  If you've seen the series, you understand and will buy this.  If you HAVEN'T seen the show, then sample an episode.  I'm sure that you will want this collection after a taste of the series.",1310169600,2011-07-09
3.0,"I suspect that when they cast Piper Perabo in this role they knew her appeal would salvage some listless story lines. Her placement in each scene is a bit too intentional, perhaps they rely too much on Piper. The show is a bit contrived and 'too sexy' for it's own good.",1356566400,2012-12-27
4.0,I love this show. Well...used to. I'm about half way through the first season. It started out being really interesting but now I'm getting annoyed because there is so much christianity being brought in to it and I don't care to watch anything about that. I understand it's part of viking history but seeing as the christians in real life destroyed so much evidence of viking culture I can't really stand to watch it. I want to see vikings. Not christians.,1376352000,2013-08-13

2.0,"I'm a fan of a post apocalyptic story if it is done well and I think it is very hard to do them well.  I'm a huge fan of the Walking Dead mostly because it has smart writing, smart characters and was edgy and inventive when I started watching it.  I don't think THE AFTER is going to keep me interested. I'd be willing to re-evaluate after the next show, but given that Amazon's other pilots were ALL so much better than this one I wouldn't want to see this one get made at the expense of one of the other ones.  We have a bunch of stereotypical strangers thrown together by some vague apocalyptic event and for some reason they stick together even though every fiber of my being would tell me that I don't want to be around the stereotypical escaped convict thug (tossing the N word around every other sentence is very offensive to me whether someone is black or white.  We have a female cop, a rich/sick 60 ish whiny woman, a French mom separated from her family, a stereotypically drunken Irish dude, a gay man whom we meet dressed as a clown, a cocky attorney, a religious call girl,  and I'm sure that any other miscellaneous strangers will reveal their stereotypes in the next couple of episodes.  The acting wasn't that great--pretty much overacted by many of them and despite the fact that I LOVED the X-Files this one is going to have to come a long way to come up in my estimation.  I really had hoped to like this but it is what it is.....",1391817600,2014-02-08

5.0,"I bought this for my 22 year old son in college because he didn't have time to watch and wanted to get this season watched before this new season started on Saturday, August 10th.  We all love this show and were so happy it got renewed.  We just watched the third season opener and it was outstanding!  Highly recommend watching this show.  Great writing, acting, direction and filmed in a great location. They try to keep this show realistic and I think they have succeeded.  I have to say, they had one of the most beautiful and well done love/sex scenes I have seen in a long time on television.  I was able to watch it with my 19 year old daughter and she thought it was beautiful. I have no desire to watch porn scenes with my kids in the room.  I usually have to fast forward to the next scene.  We are getting disgusted with the over the top and pornographic sex scenes and it was so nice to see and to show my daughter how it should be done and how beautiful it can be.  Kudos to the writer, director, and the actors for that scene!  Bravo!",1376352000,2013-08-13

3.0,"The countryside is gorgeous, Galway, Ireland what's not to like? The actors mostly up and coming, none of whom I recognized, the storyline, tried and true.A dad, calls his three children home, he has something he wants to talk about. Is he ill, is he in trouble, what is going on? The three children all return home, one with her husband and two children, one with his current girl in tow, and one all by himself. The secret it turns out is not too scary. And, all of the children bring secrets of their own. This is billed as a dysfunctional modern Irish family, but, in reality, it is a normal family coming together two years after the death of their mother.There are some fun times, lots of boring, nothing really said times, fair acting, but nothing in this film grabs you to really want to know more. The scenery is the best bet, and there is a lot to see. We visit pubs where everyone gets drunk, children's playground, cemetery, and scenes of the farm, which looks nice enough. Which does make me wonder how the dad all by himself kept the place looking so good.  When all is said and done there is no big family meeting to settle things, it seems it is all done in small groups, or by looks, but we are not privy to too much of the conversation.Really a film for Seinfeld fans, about nothing.Recommended For The Scenery.  prisrob 02-22-14",1393027200,2014-02-22

5.0,"It's REMASTERED. Of course it's reissued as series 6. 4 Poirots. Previously aired/released episodes, but now with better picture. According to friends using Blu-ray, it's great if you have a large screen. Excellent on normal DVDs too. Sets being offered are in original UK airing order. I've listed episodes, so check and see if you already own them.If not, this is a grand opportunity for those new to this Belgian with `little gray cell' who out-sleuths `The Yard.' David Suchet made Poirot famous. Philip Jackson plays Chief Inspector Japp in 2 episodes. Hastings (Hugh Fraser) Poirot's right-hand arrives in two episodes. Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) is back for one episode.I've never been disappointed with Poirot. Agatha Christie stories always fantastic, but Suchet makes adaptations soar to new heights. Humor, scenic bliss, and costumes rival script brilliance. It's tough cutting books to 100 TV minutes. This series does it well. Trivially note: Poirot fictional character was granted a 1975 New York Times front page obit.SUBTITLE option available for all 4 feature-length episodes. Guest stars aplenty, as normal.~~~~~Hercule Poirot's Christmas- 1995The detective Poirot takes a holiday. A family Christmas gathering leaves a man murdered, apparently by one of his adult children. So much for a cozy Christmas by the Yule log.~~~~~Hickory Dickory Dock- 1995Petty theft turns to murder in a heartbeat, or lack of. Miss Lemon convinces Poirot to look in crime in her sister's hostel. See Jonathan Firth playing Nigel, yes Colin's brother.~~~~~Murder on the Links- 1996Poirot's and Hastings' reputations travel to France. Oui, Oui, more murder, kidnapping, downright nasty crime for the pair to sleuth. Some just die for a game of French golf.~~~~~Dumb Witness- 1996It's more than a family affair, and estate planning.

3.0,"In the future the cult of celebrity reaches an inane position. People are famous for being famous. They pay to contract the same disease as a celebrity in order to feel closer to them. Meat is grown. synthesized from their DNA and is sold and consumed.Syd March (Caleb Landry Jones) works for the Lucus Clinic an agency whose flagship celebrity is Hannah Geist (Sarah Gadon). He freelances on the side, which causes trouble. He contracts a deadly virus shared by Hannah.The film questions today's celebrity craze, reality star society. I found it interesting and engrossing, but lacking in entertainment as our star mopes about the screen. The dialogue and action was boring and slow. While the film clearly questions the celebrity cult, it fails to create a satire with bite.Makes for an interesting, near thought provoking rental.Parental Guide: No f-bombs (?), No sex.

5.0,"Other than the fact the machine that knows all is limited to Manhattan, this program makes one query every time:  what if there was a omnipresent computer that could predict everything?  The dramatic interpretation of this question is cleverly played out in this series.  Very well-written and efficient, it is television to look forward to every week.  The writing and character trajectory driven by a moral as well as practical considerations removes the helpless, alienating idea of a computer world with flawed super-heroes ready to serve intellectually, tactically and, this is the 21st Century, sometimes barely merciful violence.  (Shooting in the knees instead of instant death, for example.)  This is TV that many wish for because it is smart and a story well told.

4.0,Season 3 started with a Roar....just like a good movie....and that went on for afew episodes...till drama got in the way....crying babies and more drama that wedid'nt really need.... i dont mind knowing a bit of the crew's relationships butthis season they waste a lot of episodes on this crap. And if you are smart youcan see where this serie is going and how it possibly gonna end.So ..yep lots of great single episodes that gives Science Fiction a big boost butwe known that drama and Religion will eventually take over.So ..at this point...im only looking at the good episodes and i am fast fowardingthe social drama parts that are making me fall asleep.But by the end of this season....things once again are getting interesting...very interesting...and cant wait to watch season 4.,1359590400,2013-01-31

5.0,"I am so glad there is a great superhero show that is compelling and not fluffy, even though it's on one of the most one dimensional networks out there. Stephen Amell is a fantastic choice for Green Arrow. And the supporting cast is very nice too.  I also like that there is more than one person of color in the main cast.  The networks still have a problem with this.  But that is besides the point.  Green Arrow, great show!!!",1372032000,2013-06-24

4.0,"I thought this seasons were as good as the other seasons. It's because there was just so much drama with Josh and Jake that over shadow the show. Damn brads didn't understand the way how bad fishing works. When there's good fishing you can just grab the crab and go. When there's bad fishing, you have to wait it out and find where the crab is. Those two didn't get that idea and just turned tail and ran away during king crab season.The wizard had bad fishing in crab season too, but did they run away from it? No, they stayed and looked for the crab until they found it. Also by doing so, they came in with high numbers too. It's just basics. Can't find the crab? Stay until you find it somewhere else. It ain't rocket science.The other boats were as usually. Had there little fights here and there but find the crab. There are two new boats shown in this seasons. Probably the only other big thing to talk about was that Edger from the NorthWestern left the boat after king crab season. I hope he comes back some day.",1335139200,2012-04-23

4.0,I liked this program because it shows there is always another side to people and things we put on pedestals.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more of the truth about an individual or religion.  Because the whole truth will never be in the history books.  Very interesting and informative.,1370649600,2013-06-08
4.0,"Season 5 of Sons of Anarchy was non-stop action all the way. While the show does focus a lot of the Outlaw Club, there are also lots of other people who come along. Jax finds himself a lamb in the lion's den and has to face down a lot of new enemies. You also have Clay looking for revenge and Gemma desperately trying to hold the family together. The show features a lot of realistic human interaction with people from all walks of life. I especially enjoyed Kim Coates in his role of Tig. There were so many great episodes this season, it's hard to pick a favorite. Its even harder to avoid spoilers, but one of the best shows of the season featured a dramatic death I never saw coming. Definitely a thrilling season and the Blu-ray gives you lots of bonus footage you won't see anywhere else. Its a great deal and the perfect way to enjoy every episode back to back.",1377561600,2013-08-27

4.0,"Although this is not your typical Zombie movie splatter fest style movie, I thought it was unique and interesting. Not a cinematic classic but worth watching.

5.0,"When they killed off Agent Colson in the movie I was really upset.  He was my favorite character.  He was the go-to-guy to get the job done and he always came through.  On top of that he comes across as a really nice guy.  I was pulled into the series because they brought back Agent Colson.  I'm still intrigued by how they are going to explain it.  So far they've just given the barest of suggestions that even Colson doesn't know the truth.  And to top it all off, the plot was good, the other characters are incredibly young, good looking, and super talented in their fields.  Not a pimple to be seen.  I'm almost hoping they bring in someone more normal looking for a reality check.  All in all, I really liked the pilot. Good thing Agent Colson is back to get the job done.",1387065600,2013-12-15

5.0,Books and movies that are not predictable are my favorite. This movie took me awhile to catch on to the premise so I gave it a good rating. The beginning drags only because it is out of sequence to the story. It takes time to get used to the back and forth of the story line and then it hits you what is going on. At that point everything makes sense. I'm trying not to give anything away so details about the story won't be given here. I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys something different.,1360886400,2013-02-15

3.0,"2014R: Reasonable flick. Doubt if I'll watch it again.Almost seemed like Samuel L. Jackson was an afterthought - late addition to the film. He certainly did his usual (excellent) thing, but with so little character development it leaves you wondering why/how/what possible psychosis is driving this dude. All of his notable (evil) roles have fully developed character backgrounds. Here, we're basically asked to take his craziness on faith.Could be re-edited to make a better flick. Enjoy MFJLabs 3x",1391731200,2014-02-07

4.0,"By the time I finished this I was not sure if the movie was about the title character or the narrating soul searcher played by Colin Hanks. I think in the end, the filmmakers did not care either way and after watching the special features I became aware it was more about Malkovich doing what he does so well, nothing more or less. Is always nice to see Tom Hanks even if just for a few minutes.The Blu presentation was average throughout, with literally two or three scenes utilizing the DTS in adequacy. Everything looked a bit better than the DVD in both color and clarity, but the majority of the indoor sequences have plenty of grain. I was hoping the special features would bump this up but I could only give them a half-star more than the 3.5 for the film. The deleted scenes were thankfully cut, the extended scenes of each mock interview (Regis, Martha, etc.) were included as a separate feature - but were rightfully cut short also. The outtakes were unfunny and easily showed some irritation by Malkovich when someone else would screw up. The 9 minutes of behind the scenes were painfully all about the usual how great everyone is, the 4 minute blip from HDNet was the promo they had been showing for awhile leaving the only worthwhile supplement as the interview of the real guy that ""inspired"" Buck Howard. His quick talk sums up the film: everything John did on the stage was right on - anything else is all made up by the filmmakers.Not exactly a test Blu, but can suffice for a mellow evening rental with only one supplement worth watching.",1247961600,2009-07-19

I'd ditch the season if it didn't get cleaner.",1366848000,2013-04-25

I love that try chose to make a show about a bunch of really awesome guys doing something spectacular an against the grain for once because it seems like most reality TV shows these days are primarily based upon trash and smut. After watching season one of Mountain Men I definitely fell in love with these certainly unlikely TV stars! My favorites are Tom and Martin. My only beef with this show and this the reason I rated it at 4 stars instead of 5 is the ridiculous voice of the narrator as well as the way this show tries WAY too hard to create drama where this is none. I guess that is the ony way to keep people interested in shows these days. Call me old fashioned, but I would really perfer if they stopped making this show about unnecessary drama and focused more on the lives of these truly awesome guys!",1395273600,2014-03-20
3.0,"PLEASE NOTE: Reviews are opinions. The purpose of the reviews are to HELP those who haven't seen the show decide whether or not they want to purchase/read/watch/listen to something. That's what the voting is for NOT if you agree or disagree with the reviewer. If you disagree-write a review. The comments section IS for those who want to disagree.The second season of ""Heroes"" stumbled with its story arc involving Hiro traveling back in time to feudal Japan. FYI, that subplot IS tied into the main plot of the second season. The focus here is on the Shanti Virus a concoction that can take away someone's powers but IS often lethal. There is also someone targeting those who were involved in the founding of ""The Company"". As with ""Lost"" the introduction of new characters was problematic--fans were more interested in finding out what happened to their favorites from season one. The show recovers somewhat by midset unfortunately the show was interrrupted by the Writer's Guild strike. I have no doubt that the second half of the second season would have made up for the stumbling start of season two based on what we find out in the extras but that didn't happen.The show looks extremely good in its DVD presentation. The extras are quite good as well which does make up for the diminished quality of the show. We get 11 commentary tracks. I haven't had time to listen to more than one or two of them but they are pretty good. If I'm not mistaken these are the audio versions of the video commentaries that were available on the ""Heroes"" website.A couple of the featurettes included here were also on the webiste. The most effective and interesting ones here are the preview of season three (which has some minor spoilers so you may want to wait to watch it if you want to be totally surprised)and a featurette that allows us to see how a series of scenes wer constructed.""Heroes"" still has tremendous potential and here's hoping that the third season ""Villians"" is an improvement over the second season.

Sure, there's always an element of alien terror, but nothing that the Doctor can't handle. There's a lot on what the Ponds have been up to lately, more on Rory's father, the introduction of the daughter of a character from the old series, and a few other surprises. Telling any more would be, well, telling, and if you haven't seen this one I don't want to spoil it for you. I'd say this is my second or third favorite of the season so far.",1348358400,2012-09-23

5.0,"I was VERY impressed with the way this movie plays out.  I remember seeing it on the Horror Blogs/sites and not giving it much attention, but the other day, I finally decided to give it a go.  Boy am I glad I did!  The ONLY complaint I have with the movie is Kether Donohue's acting during her video ""outing"" the whole situation.  Her acting during the actual event was REALLY good, but it seems during the one on one footage that she was a little less sure of herself.  I don't know,...I'm no film expert, so maybe I'm thinking too much into it.  Regardless, if you like the ""found footage"" genre, then you simply MUST watch this movie.  If they had put in out into the media as a publicity stunt and ""leaked"" some of the footage, I believe this would have gone out as a massive scare.  It one of those movies that makes you think it's something that could actually happen!  The subject matter is part of the reason why I'm not a fan of swimming in lakes and ponds or any other natural body of water.  You never know what's in there!The movie begins with Donna (Kether Donohue) making a video to tell the world what actually happened on July 4, 2009 in her small town of Maryland.  The movie follows Donna as she is making her video and playing/discussing the footage that has since surfaced after the whole ordeal.  During the town's Fourth of July festivities, people begin to become ill from what they think is some type of virus.  This leads to chaos erupting amongst the towns citizens and leaders and eventually becomes a matter of national security.The movie is played out mostly through the newscast that Donna works for.  It's her first time in the field and she's suddenly stumbled into the story of the century.  Throughout the movie, we see clips of homemade footage shot by other locals and town leaders.  The fact that most of it is newsfeed makes it FAR more watchable then most ""found footage"" movies out.  In my opinion, at least.Everyone needs to watch this movies.  Whether you're a ""horror"" fan or not.  It's just a really interesting movie.",1392595200,2014-02-17

5.0,Fascinating serial that has more twists and turns than an arthritic snake.  It has a constantly changing story line and a very moral base to it and perhaps that is what appeals to me most  -- the integration of moral considerations in a changing universe.  And yet it is not overly moral either with plenty of blood and gore to satisfy that side of the equation.,1390867200,2014-01-28
3.0,"I realize that it is always a challenge to make something entertaining and historically accurate. This is not always the easiest creative process, but other shows like &#34;Deadwood&#34; and the &#34;Hatfields & McCoys&#34; have already forged an inspired path proving it can be accomplished, and accomplished to a high standard.So how could the Discovery Channel end up creating such an &#34;epic&#34; malaise out of the riches they had available to them? The depth of the actual history, the dangerous majesty of the wilderness, the benefit of an excellent cast, obviously substantial production resources, and have it all feel so flat and unfulfilled.Just the variety of real life characters alone, from Bill Haskell to father Judge, the Count to the Mounted Superintendent, Belinda Mulrooney to Jack London, how were they not able to adapt something magnificent out of that? This mini-series had such a mother-load of story-telling potential that was carefully cultivated over three nights promising grand finales that were never fully realized.",1393286400,2014-02-25

4.0,The season starts off pretty good but gets bogged down in several places.  The &#34;evil bad guys&#34; are more distracting and overly powerful it seems.

3.0,"First off, I do not watch ""Glee."" But, I appreciate a decent musical. The internet probably needs a musical show like ""Browsers"" in the world of internet news. The cast was the best thing about it. Bebe Neuwirth definitely makes this worth watching and would keep me coming back for more. The songs did not annoy me and the actors can certainly sing well. That being said, I really did not connect with the characters or their stories much and felt they were too stereotyped, even for a histrionic show like this. I am not certain that this premise could contain an entire series. Bitter interns singing about doing their job for free? Has a nice ring to it, but I am not confident I would stay with it as an on-going series. I think it might just work better as a viral video, which this kind of came off as an overextended version of. I do thank amazon.com for trying something like this.

Romola Garai is beautiful in the role of tv news producer, so beautiful that I was willing to stop being suspicious about such a one getting that job in the 1950s. I would watch Anna Chancellor in anything, and she is such great fun in The Hour as the cynical (on the surface) Lix Storm, seasoned reporter.

2.0,"First off, I've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades, and they've all had some things in common, and they've all had some differences. Most of them steal from the original (Bram Stoker) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources (such as Anne Rice) because vampire canon, such as it is, was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice. I loved, loved, LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV show, not the movie) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show, as was its spin-off Angel.That said, I disagree with most reviewers who've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel. It is not. The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires, not the pantheon of assorted trolls, demons, and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated. Also, the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight, the short-lived (3 seasons) CBS ""Crime Time After Prime Time"" early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto. Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight, in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the ""monster"" he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development, plot devices, and historical flashbacks/backstory. Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman, with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger, death, or some other terrible outcome (the human being ""turned"" vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath); thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other's lives (plot device), and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same, er, species (living or undead) (also plot devices). And, like Nick Knight, Mick St. John prefers not to drink (eat) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood, Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood. Moonlight, in those respects, is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight. (After this point, there are SPOILERS, so you may want to stop reading now...)However, there are some clever differences: Forever Knight's big, bad sire vampire LaCroix, who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his ""gift"" of eternal life (and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship) has been replaced by Coraline. Coraline is Mick St. John's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who'd lived some 500 years, sired Mick (made him a vampire) on their wedding night (in 1952), and enmeshed him in an obsessive, addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually couldn't. He never wanted to be a vampire -- he didn't even know she was one when they married. She made him a vampire against his will, without asking him or getting his permission. Now, of course, he has ""trust issues."" She, from her perspective, gave him a ""gift"" of eternal life -- freedom from death (sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight!).Coraline crossed a fatal line, however, when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little ""family"" (sounds familiar, eh? rather like Lestat, Louis, and Claudia in Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire). Mick, by this time (1982), was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective (it is implied, though not directly stated, that he ""does good"" as a PI because he feels guilty about the ""bad"" he's done as a vampire). It was in this capacity that the girl's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes don't kill vampires, they just paralyze them. Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe. Mick, in his PI role in the first episode, finds the distraught mother's little girl, rescues her, stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her, and sets the place on fire before locking her in. The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family. Thus begins Mick's distant ""relationship"" with Beth Turner, who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire, a mostly online magazine that's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox's character Lucy edits on FX's show Dirt, except it's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism. Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight, ""No Such Thing as Vampires,"" Beth, now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions (but news-whore tendencies), winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers. Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA (with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef, a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring, formerly on Veronica Mars).I didn't watch this episode on CBS. In fact, I didn't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS' web site of full video, Innertube. I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin's eye-candy good looks, I've always loved the vampire genre, and I dearly loved Jason Dohring's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars, so I knew I wanted to catch the show. But I wasn't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing. The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche-ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he's on it because he's got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin. She also isn't your typical stick-thin, anorexic-looking TV actress; the girl's got a little meat on her bones. So, unlike many of the women on TV, she actually occasionally looks like a ""real"" woman. Finally, (5) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode, however, was straight out of B-movie (or is that B-TV) hell. I thought, ""Eh, that was was pretty; I'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better."" I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back, too. But I wasn't expecting much from the show based on the first episode. I figured it would be my guilty pleasure, something I'd watch as ""webisodes"" and not much else.Surprisingly, it's getting really good. This has a lot to do with improved writing, developing backstory, intersecting relationship triangles, and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline. It's still eye candy, but I don't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV. I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox. I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this. But the most recent episodes (we're up to episode 9 now) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick, while also increasing the tension between Mick's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef (Jason Dohring) and the unhappy, secretly self-hating Mick, who longs for a cure for his vampirism, some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick ""went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster"" has only improved the show's ""grab"" factor. The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn, but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon. And there's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well. There are some very sexy (though still network-TV-permissible) scenes on later eps and I'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake: like Angel, Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them, as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight, and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires. It's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human, and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two (or three or four) evils, or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making. They're still vampire shows, and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not ""serious"" literature. But as Battlestar Galactica fans know, it's not the genre that defines the shows, it's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective, this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all, and neither is the second. But the show is coming along, it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode, ""No Such Thing As Vampires,"" and the second Moonlight episode, as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following (more entertaining and less contrived) episodes.",1195776000,2007-11-23

4.0,"An interesting concept for an interesting and ambiguous crime series.Roth is an alien, a legal alien, an Englishman in Washington DC. He is a highly paid professional in the business of lie detection. He runs a company that sells services to all kinds of agencies. You name them, he serves them.His specialty is facial expression and body language. His hobby horse is 'micro expression', facial situations of less than a second, detectable only on film. Roth's business is consequently the ultimate spying approach: film people and watch the tapes to catch the ungarded moment. Of course his firm is also able to analyze voices, hence sound is also taped.He has a female American partner and two ethnic American specialist staff: an Israeli and a Hispanic woman. Roth is the ultimate expert who will manipulate even his own team to his purposes.The basic message of the series: be smarter. Don't try to beat the truth out of your suspects. It is more comfortable to catch them in contradictions and lies.So far so good, if you want to accept that these things can be done and that they should be done, as they might work better than other approaches. Of course nobody would want to live with living lie detectors like these, hence their private lives are troubled.Why do I deduct a star? First of all, Roth is so much the star here, most other actors move like wooden puppets. Casting is uneven, to say it politely. Second, the range of possible stories is limited, so unavoidably some of the episodes are contrived or lame. If you delete half of the series (but how do you know which ones?), you will have an interesting and even challenging TV entertainment. Challenging not because it is hard to grasp, but because its ethical implications are far from clear.",1261612800,2009-12-24

2.0,"As a fan of political dramas, I decided to give &#34;Crisis&#34; a try because it looked like a very interesting premise.  Plus, being an X-Files junkie, I was curious about Gillian Anderson's return to network TV.  Those assumptions did hold...for about two episodes.  After that, unfortunately, the show turns into a standard crime procedural lacking any sort of &#34;new ground&#34;.After the first two episodes of &#34;Crisis&#34;, I thought that I had found the next great political drama.  A group of high-society prep students on a school field trip (one being the son of the President of the United States) are kidnapped and held hostage.  It is very interesting to see the different dynamics between the students and how they all react a little bit differently to the situation.  Even the heavily-advertised Gillian Anderson return is a hit, as her character adds a toughness angle to the show that seems intriguing.Sadly, that is where the innovation of this show ends.  For the next 3/4 episodes, it turns into a complete procedural.  It has the stereotypical &#34;one male, one female F.B.I. agent&#34; (played by Lance Gross & Rachael Taylor) premise, and follows a &#34;one parent of a hostage each week&#34; approach to storytelling.  It is sad, because had the show-runners been able to focus on the relationships between the teen hostages themselves, THAT is where the interesting material was.  As soon as the focus shifted to the parents, it became tedious and un-inspiring.  Even Anderson's character has been pretty much in invisible since those first couple episodes.I compare &#34;Crisis&#34; to a show like &#34;Intelligence&#34; on CBS.  Both shows had great kernels of concepts/ideas, but instead of truly breaking ground with original storytelling, the networks instead shoe-horn those interesting plots into tired TV storytelling conventions.  Both shows were also advertised as something almost completely different from what they turned out to be.  Much like &#34;Intelligence&#34;, I would be surprised if &#34;Crisis&#34; gets a renewal for a second season.  It just doesn't differentiate itself enough from other similar &#34;stock&#34; fare on television these days.",1398038400,2014-04-21

Go Steelers or whatever! Sports! Manly things! Basically I'm a walking stereotype with little or no inner life. Check out my muscles!""Everyone in the office has to eventually sleep with someone else in the office. It's practically the law on this series. Bones and Booth are a boring pair. Emily Deschanel cannot force her body language or facial muscles into fooling the camera into thinking she is even remotely excited to be around Boreanaz's character. Even if she could, her character has been painted too far into a very unemotional corner. Nothing about it makes sense to me. I can see ALL the other couples on the show happening, but not those two. (Also, the wedding episode was so boring that neither of us could pay attention to the whole thing. It really stunk. A lot. Everything that makes the show worth watching was left in the dust.)The technical advising on computer/internet related things is really bad at times. Pelant hacks the lab computers by arranging a crime scene in some mathematically significant way, probably based on an exploit from around 2005 where .jpg files could be corrupted in a certain way to cause problems. Of course, that exploit required modifying an already-existing file. You can't just move stuff around in a room to cause it. Whoever researched that simply did not do their job, and then we had to groan as they wrapped us up in this giant plot hole. The Angela-tron is similar: I'd believe it if the show was set in 2030, but today, all the money in the world can't make that happen. It's just not around yet.Nevertheless, the show is interesting enough, when we aren't being bombarded with blundering workplace relationships or plot holes. There is a fair amount of action and adventure. There's tension, meaningful problems are being solved (except in the pointless wedding episode), etc. And Hodgins blows stuff up sometimes. That's fun. They film outdoors in a bunch of different places so you don't feel like you're getting the same rehashed stuff all the time. If they had spent more time developing the Booth character, and if they had taken Dr. Brennan in a less ""high functioning autism"" direction, it would have been four stars. Maybe even five.",1382400000,2013-10-22

4.0,"I bought the entire first season of prime suspect and I must say I enjoyed almost every episode now of course it is written in the typical American television format with typical antagonists and subtexts but I just like Maria Bello so much that I could watch her in just about anything although she is not a classic beauty there is something about her that I find extremely attractive and thus my opinion is probably severely bias but compared to what's on television today I do not think that you will be disappointed in any of the episodes even though the writing is only mediocre you'll see many good character actors who you may have seen in many other television and movie shows this is because like the show itself is just a show that works, the dynamic between her father and her has been used in many different ways in many different police shows but even though it's clich&eacute; it still is rather endearing and just watching the other three or four good character actors practice their craft it's worth a watch I'm not saying it still Street blues more am I saying it's NYPD Blue I'm just saying hey give it a look Maria is very watchable respectfully Johnny Irish",1354579200,2012-12-04

5.0,"OK, I think I have other season reviews that  say these are stand alone shows.  By this season, they really are not.  The characters are too interwoven and with clips of this one or that one, I can see it would be hard to follow if you didn't know what was going on.  That said, Grimm is probably my favorite TV show of  all the current shows.  I think starting at the first season and watching through the seasons would be worth it.  I own them all.  The story line is great the Grimm, the Vessen (those who are the fairytale characters), the Royals ... all their lives and relationships interwoven.  Any given show will have a theme policeman called to a crime scene.  Then, there are the deeper stories that intertwine the weekly characters.  It is fresh and well done.  It is well worth the money to watch, if you like this kind of show.  It  is well done!",1386460800,2013-12-08
1.0,"I didn't like this program, it is inane and a pilot that must be trying to boost the actor's career, and he overacts his part in comparison to the rest of the show.

5.0,"Warning! The following contains spoilers. If you haven't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free, do not read this review.Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet. Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed. What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy, demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals (disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated)? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having ""us"" attack ""them"" by the death of another semi-recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right, as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was, despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France, became increasingly blatant. To his credit Moore, a member of the left but a self-admitted Rush Limbaugh listener, has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show's run, but in the season's first several episodes that balance fell away. And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes. All of these were of the ""stand alone"" variety. All of the ""mythology"" episodes (to use the X-FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses) were outstanding. In posts on boards, podcasts, and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network. The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers. But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point. This is the beauty of DVDs. Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs, borrowing them from a friend, downloading them from iTunes, or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store. Bizarrely the networks don't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica. Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there, in particular Tigh and Kara. Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica, especially between Kara and Lee, take much of the season resolve, and the whole New Caprica experience doesn't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale. In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs, I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.1. The Adama Maneuver: During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Since Galactica cannot fly in an atmosphere, they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface, jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth. It is - and I say this with little fear of contradiction - the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV. No one who has seen it has been able to forget it. It is inconceivable that the show won't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects (but then, it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year) and when it does, this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.2. Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple. As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks. She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck, kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly. She returns to the dining table, takes a bite, then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin, oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.3. The death of Jammer: In ""Collaborators"" several characters we've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. We've known Jammer since Season One when he, Cally, and Socino tried to make a still. But that doesn't prevent him from being shot out an airlock. Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.4. Five great Sharon moments. This is a total cheat, but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five. 1) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon. She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica. Our first shot of her in Season Three, her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture: a desk with books, an end table and coffee table, wall hangings and curtains, a comfy chair, and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch. Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone, except for her. Clearly in the previous year, somehow Sharon had become just about Adama's closest friend. 2) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon, she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet. Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others - whether human or Cylon - that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it. Though some doubt her, Adama's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season. 3) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica. She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers, who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive. Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna's knees. She walks away, saying ""Adama wouldn't lie to me"" (and it turns out he didn't, since he didn't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death). 4) Sharon and Boomer come face to face. One of the season highlights had to be the show's two major Number Eight's meeting. The irony is intense, since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet, unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent. Now, however, Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she doesn't belong with the humans. Her reply is to the point: ""I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie."" 5) Boomer does, however, tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar. After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer's story is true, Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship. Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica. The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon. Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them, ""And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral."" What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt. But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera. Oh, and Sharon is given her own handle: Athena, a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama's daughter. And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.5. ""Exodus, Pt. 2"": I said I wouldn't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here. But this episode, which contained ""The Adama Maneuver"" I mentioned above, is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG. At the end of 2006 the well-known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year. With total justification they named ""Exodus, Pt. 2"" the number one episode of 2006, not just of BSG but of all television shows combined. It was that good. Four beats made it stand out. First, Saul Tigh's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons, second the Adam Maneuver, third, the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction, and fourth, Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.6. The fight between Kara and Lee in ""Unfinished Business."" In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another. In this episode we get that back story. Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another. We see Lee and Kara's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring, learning of the night of passion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another, and of Kara's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning. As Kara and Lee (who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting) collapse into each other's arms, their faces bloody messes, she tells him, ""I missed you."" His mouth filled with blood, he is barely able to say, ""I missed you too."" Her face buried in his shoulder, you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends. One of the best episodes in the show's run.7. In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar, D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal. As he tells Six ""I love you"" D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved. It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.8. Adama and Laura's intimacy. Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer, as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic. They still have conflicts. When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her. And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar's trial. But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level. That they have an intimacy that can't be affected by mere disagreement. The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars. It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace/9. Lee Adama's moment on the stand. During Baltar's trial Romo Lampkin (magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co-counsel. Jamie Bamber's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.10. The last ten minutes of the season: In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five: Tigh, Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders, and Tory (the four T's--giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace is the fifth member) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads, which turns out, almost impossibly, to be Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"" (leading some to refer to them as the Dylons). Then the Cylons attack. The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three: ""The ship is under attack, we do our jobs. . . . My name is Saul Tigh. I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet. Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be. And if I die today, that's the man I'll be. But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season, as Lee pursues ""a bogie at my ten"" in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace, who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier. She looks at Lee, assures him that it really is her (a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore, who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons), and tells him, ""It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is. And I'm gonna take us there."" The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet, through the pursing Cylons, back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way, and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system, focusing on earth as the season ends. It is an utterly breathtaking moment.This is absolutely essential television. If you care for great television, this is the kind of stuff you have to care about. The tragedy is that while every major television critics has passionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV, it has struggled to find viewers. The irony is that many Sci-fi fans don't watch it because it doesn't resort to the clich&eacute;s that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans don't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci-fi fans. It is what it is: the best show on TV. You need to watch this.",1201132800,2008-01-24

4.0,"This is the first season that James the gravedigger is in. He is great to root for because he's not a great talker and he's the biggest powerhouse to play the game. He ends up with 2 idols and makes a bad move. Amanda is one of the stronger girls to play the game but she gets pretty annoying because of how smug she is. Todd is the biggest schemer and deserves to win the game more than anyone else. This season has a big twist that screws the 2 strongest players in the game, Aaron and James. Courtney is probably the weakest player ever to play to game. She starts the game at 93 lbs and ends up at 86 lbs. Jean Robert is the token jerk. Peih Gee is supper annoying and freaks out all the time and she thinks she's somehow the leader of a tribe. James' tribe is great to root for and Peih Gee's tribe is the tribe you hope loses.

3.0,"It's always the same: writers at this level never do seem to overcome the contradictions of their own creations.Marseillaise, being a vampire and having the power to change people's minds  wants to go out with a gal he knows, a human. So, why not just gaze into her eyes and convince her she's in love with him? Or, that she's horny and wants to have sex with him? Having the power to convince people by a vampiric mind meld precludes any wants of that sort. Ok, so maybe he wants her 'true love.' But why wait for the first date? Just, you know, make it happen. It's these types of things that make me yawn.However, after two episodes, and I've never read any Ann Rice--although I did see an Ann Rice novel turned into a Broadway show I watched in person in NYC, and it was quite engaging and thought provoking--but the writing is on the level of a cheap soap opera, because that's what it is. It's marginally as good as Sanctuary, and no where close to Star Gate/Atlantis or Star Trek Next Generation/Deep Space Nine, or Enterprise. Yes, those can be cheesy, but the writing is coherent.I know there are a lot of people here who have followed this series from the Dairies. I have no truck with you. You most likely watch the these types of series for other reasons than I do. I watch them for consistency in plot, character, morality/ethical philosophical issues that make me think, and tactical strategies that make logical sense. So, when I see contradictions, I lose a little interest until after too many, I simply stop watching. This is what happened after  ""The River in Reverse.""I just finished ""The River in Reverse."" Same thing again, and after this last episode, I've figured out where the writers are coming from. It's a Vampire Soap Opera. Or, put another way, a soap opera with vampires. Or, put another way, no way to make sense of what people do.The main point of watching soap operas is to get your emotions yanked by people doing stupid things to each other. Case point: Nickolaus can't be killed. He can't even be subdued. Really? How about this: Instead of wrapping some chains around his arms and then having a couple of weak flunkies hold them, why not fire a few iron harpoons through him like whalers use to do to whales where the loose ends of the chains are screwed into 10' x 10' concrete blocks, then dump him in 20 feet of solid concrete? I have another idea. Why not cut his head off? Oh wait, here's another more modern solution, a 30mm cannon round in his head (If he lives, well, ok, but that 30mm round is going to vaporize half his body. Maybe they could call the next episode ""The Torso w/o a HEAD!""). Really? This is stupid. And then at the end of the episode, we're suppose to feel sorry for a psychopathic murderer? Please! This is 8th grade mentality, people, with a dose of unbelievable tossed in to make sure your completely brain dead. It's really sad too becsaue the acting is great and the idea superb.Overall impression:Acting: Pretty damn decent. Actors are believable. It would be nice is casting would work on getting some normal looking people as I doubt all people are as beautiful as they are in these types of series--which is really non-reality. Conversely, in Game of Thrones, you get all sorts of people, not all pretty, which makes the entire series feel more real and emerges you into the plots.Writing: As stated. A sell out to a lower mentality who needs cheap thrills by having their emotions yanked again and again, no matter how idiotic the ideas get to yank them.FX: Good. Nothing cheesy about the FX.Plot: Well, it's all about power, hubris, and emotions. It would be nice if the writers had enough skill to pull that off. Instead, they go for cheap emotional thrills, much like a bad horror flick goes for the cheap adrenaline rush.Conclusion: If you're looking for cheap emotional thrills at the expense of coherent story line, and you like soap operas, go for it. You'll get your fix almost every 3 minutes. However, if you have more than an 8th grade mentality and you need your brain challenged on a critical level, in that you need some semblance of coherency in plot, you'll really be dissapointed. This is purely a soap opera where the writer's goal is to simply yank your emotional chain with unbelievably incoherent events unrelated to any real thought process. Think cheap horror flick and you have it, except the goal here is to give the viewer a cheap emotional fix rather than a quick shot of adrenaline.",1384732800,2013-11-18

5.0,"Ti West does it again with The Innkeepers. Just like his The House Of The Devil, he spends the first 2 acts building tension with mystery, intrigue and a bit of comedy, then slapping it on heavy in the third act with the reveal and real horror. The House Of The Devil was a throw back to 1980's occult horror, this movie is a throwback to classic films about haunted buildings, like The Shining. Sara Paxton pleasantly surprised me as charming, cute and funny in this movie and really carried the film. While this movie may be predictable like most movies about ghosts, there is a nice kind of twist at the end that weaves everything together well and If you aren't looking closely at the final shot, you may miss a very nice little treat. Way better than I expected it to be, especially since most horror movies are a let down. I should have known better because I thought The House Of The Devil was brilliant, and this movie is no exception. I thought this movie was great. On Blu-Ray it looks clean, crisp and sharp. There is no visible DNR, blacks are deep and there is visible film grain. There is also a little bit of specks on the film but overall it's a clean transfer. There aren't a lot of special features but there are some good featurettes. If you liked The House Of The Devil, you'll love this. If you like funny, slow, tension building ghost movies, you'll like this a lot. Very highly recommended, especially this time of year.",1350086400,2012-10-13

Mom turns their dreams into nightmares with a train of abusive boyfriends, the latest of which has designs for Beth. The girls conspire along with two friends to make their lives better by eliminating the problem.Georgie Henley gave us a decent goth Fairuza Balk while Abigail Breslin was our slutty Barbie Doll. The film developed at the right pace and was fairly decent for the first hour, until the deed was done.

5.0,"STEVEN SPIELBERG HIT the television world with a bang two seasons ago, producing ""Terra Nova,"" ""Smash,"" ""The River"" and ""Falling Skies."" It was a shock when three of the four diverse shows were eventually cancelled. I mean, c'mon - this is Spielberg.But audiences loved TNT's science fiction gem ""Falling Skies"" about evil aliens invading and conquering Earth, and the interracial band of men and women who used guerrilla warfare and lots of heart to fight back.""Falling Skies: Season One"" took us directly into the conflict months after the invasion. We only see the aliens from the human's viewpoint and those bad boys mean business. Cities have been destroyed, the population decimated and children have been captured and used as slave labor, rigged up with symbiotic harnesses that link them directly to the enemy. A hardy band of rebels - consisting of Capt. Dan Weaver (Will Patton), history professor Tom Mason (Noah Wylie in his best work since ""E.R."") and his sons (Maxim Knight, Connor Jessup and Drew Roy), Doctor Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) and biker renegade John Pope (Colin Cunningham) - link up, sometimes willingly, sometimes not, to take back the world.Will Wheaton hosts ""2nd Watch: Episode 20 `A More Perfect Union,'"" where a cast roundtable explores the struggles faced in Season Two. It's one of the lively features on the set. Wheaton tells us that John Rogers, co-creator of TNT's ""Leverage,"" said, ""They wrote themselves into such a corner at the end of the first season, and this entire season has just paid this off so well.""Season Two ""had to be bigger, badder, had to move faster - Had to be cooler,"" executive producer Remi Aubuchon says in the feature, ""One Page at a Time: Writing the 2nd American Revolution.""Even with all that enthusiasm Aubuchon was shocked to find no one had any plans to move past Tom walking into the alien spacecraft.Writers and producers finally asked the big question: What's the most interesting way to bring Tom back? We discover Tom has been held for months and tortured by the aliens. When he's allowed to escape and gets back to the rebel unit - the 2nd Massachusetts, named after the 1777 regiment of the Continental Army - Tom tells Capt. Weaver he can't trust himself. Have the aliens done something to him that would cause him to betray his people?That's one of the mysteries of Season Two. We also find out how Tom's sons and the rest of the 2nd Mass survived without him, where they are now, and where they hope to go. These 10 episodes uncover more answers and open more mysteries - a challenging opening to Season Three.The high-def visuals and immersive sound give Season Two the look of quality film. Extras provide a wealth of information. Short featurettes include ""Terry O'Quinn is Manchester,"" ""Team Skitter,"" and ""The Fans' Perspective: Touring the Set of `Falling Skies.'"" In ""Designing the Spaceship,"" co-executive producer/director Greg Beeman says Spielberg was ""very involved."" ""They [the aliens] grow their computer system biologically. It's kind of a big nervous system,"" he tells us. Aubuchon credits Spielberg for ""Creating the Crawlies,"" another alien baddie, in that featurette. Apparently, when the studio questioned a design or effect, techs learned to say, ""Well, that's the way Stephen wants it."" Enough said.Commentary on premier episode ""Worlds Apart"" with Wylie, Beeman and writer Mark Verheiden; ""Molon Labe,"" with Wyle, Aubuchon and writers Bradley Thompson and David Weddle; and season finale ""A More Perfect Union"" with Wylie, Aubuchon, and writers Thompson and Weddle are informative and good listening.Still, the best thing is the story - the battle of good versus evil.""Things can only get worse, Tom, and none of us wants that to happen,"" alien puppet Karen Nadler (Jessy Schram) warns our Colonial-inspired fighters.Ha - bring it on, baby.

4.0,"I don't like this season as much, because D'Onofrio is less hot, but the writing is better. However, Vince letting himself go just makes me feel a little sad inside. &#34;Seasons change... people change... &#34; If only he had valued his hotness. :/Anyway, Eames continues to be awesome, but this is the season where Vince had a breakdown and they had to bring in some other cops. DUN DUN! I really don't like the episodes with Chris Noth and his little freckle-boy-woman. Whatever. Chris Noth is okay, but he's no Vincent D'Onofrio.

It is easy to follow and a fun ride at the same time. The characters are likeable and you care what happens to them.

When they discover the photographers are on their trail, a decoy bride (Kelly MacDonald, a local pretty young lady) is hired to throw them off by having a fake wedding.

I'm saddened over what went down in this episode but I admire Sutter's guts in doing it, knowing that fan reaction would be intense. Sutter has no sacred cows. He warned us before the start of the season that Sons was about Jax's voyage, and brother, this will affect the direction Jax takes from now on. Already he is harder. I'm sad but I can't turn away. I can't remember when a show has hooked me this hard. I didn't want to see what I saw in this episode, yet it stays within the familiar bounds of love and brotherhood that these Sons have for one another. Amazing.

4.0,"t's obvious that J.T. Petty is an ambitious director, and one who doesn't have access to the resources that his vision requires. Though I appreciated his attempt in S&Man;, for instance, he tried to do a bit too much; the result was just too muddled to be truly effective. Hellbenders is in many ways a move in the right direction for Petty. This film moves away from the more parodic S&Man; and the wildly genre-blending The Burrowers. Instead, we get a pretty straight-up horror comedy, with the emphasis on comedy, particularly the foulmouthed kind. It's a genius move to give his characters a reason to behave badly (so they'll be assured a place in hell), which means there are a lot of darkly humorous moments of religious types doing very nonreligious things.I'm not sure what happened with the cast of this film. It's a significant step up from previous Petty films in terms of acting chops and name recognition. It's possible the premise was enticing, or maybe Clancy Brown (who worked on The Burrowers) put the word out. Whatever the case, the cast here is the perfect fit for a filthy film about faith. Clancy Brown is his usual stalwart self, making the perfect leader for this strange band of Hellbound Saints. Clifton Collins Jr. gets to be a bit unhinged as Lawrence, which is especially appreciated given how many more staid, mainstream roles he's taking on. The real revelation is Andre Royo, most famous for his turn as a crack addict in The Wire. This is about as far as you can get from the social commentary of that show, but Royo is up to the task, believable as a ministerHellbenders 3D (Blu-ray) is also solid, with both regular and 3D versions on the same disc. The film's 2.40:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer is fine for a lower-budget feature. The widescreen scope really gives the film a more expansive feel, with detail throughout the frame. Colors are appropriately saturated, and black levels stay pretty consistent and deep. Eagle-eyed viewers might notice a bit of compression artefacting (likely due to both versions being on the same disc), but it's not distracting at all. The film's DTS-HD 5.1 audio track is similarly impressive. Dialogue is clean and clear, with some good directionality during some of the more action-oriented scenes. It's not the widest mix out there, but it's fine for a low-budget horror/comedy.Extras start with a commentary featuring Petty and the cast. They're a chatty bunch and discuss the origins of the project along with some production stories. We also get a &#34;making of&#34; featurette, along with some behind-the-scenes footage. A tie-in short film, &#34;Exorcism&#34; is a fun addition, as is the film's trailer. This set also includes an Ultraviolet digital copy of the film.Sadly, Petty's ambitions once again get the better of him here. The fact that this is a 3D film is almost entirely a waste, with only a couple of goofy moments (including a flaming joint) to even begin to justify the exercise. Instead, the 3D effects are largely haphazard, and more importantly completely unnecessary. The unnecessary part doesn't always grate with big blockbusters that seem to have cash to spare. However, whatever money Hellbenders spend on 3D effects could have been more appropriately spent just about anywhere else in the budget. It's especially obvious in the film's second act, which has a cramped, stagebound feel as the various characters going through pages of dialogue in nondescript offices.Though I appreciate the foulmouthed take on the horror-comedy, the film gets a little goofy by the third act. There's only so much a clever concept can bring to a well-worn narrative, and the save-the-girl plot is still the save-the-girl plot, no matter how many demons you throw in the mix. Those looking for a thrillingly original horror film (or comedy for that matter) will be severely disappointed as Hellbenders gradually runs out of steam towards the end. It's not an entirely horrible experience or anything, but enjoyment of the film is going to be strongly correlated with expectations. If you go in looking for some goofy fun, you'll probably get it, but if you hope Hellbenders is the next Evil Dead II, then you may be hellbound yourself.Gordon Sullivan, VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",1392681600,2014-02-18
5.0,"Here we have the first season of BREAKING BAD.  It is amazing to realize that it is only 7 episodes for the character, plot and drama development is so thorough and realistic another show would need at least double the episodes to achieve it.  The basic plot is a teacher who finds out he is dying of cancer and thru unexpected situations gets the opportunity to make a great deal of money thru manufacturing meth.  He does so to make money for his family to be able to live on after he dies.  But the show is about so much more than this.  Every character is addicted to something and the introduction into the dark world of drugs is terrifyingly realistic.  This is honestly one of the best shows ever to air on television.  It tells a story that may be too dark for some to handle but the superb acting, writing and directing make it all work.  These characters are all believable, necessary and the intertwining of their lives is seamless.The show also succesfully combines deep psychological profiles of each character mixed with the heavy, often disturbing drama.  And the plot always serves a purpose, is realistic no matter how heavy, and is in no way gratuituous.  And with this show we also get one of the best duos ever in Walt and Jesse.  When Jesse, Aaron Paul, a former student of Walt, Bryan Cranston, joins him in the making of meth a perfect chemistry is formed.  BREAKING BAD also provides the occasional comic break that helps alleviate the heavy drama.  This series is a must for its great acting, superb writing and directing and totally unique premise.  If it sounds like any other series you have seen believe me when I say it is not.  The blu ray of course adds a dimension to the series over that of the dvd.  There are many dark scenes but the detail and clarity still shines thru and the scenes with color and specifically the lovely scenery shots pop off the screen.  Audio is superb.  This is  a series that is dialogue driven but when the action sequences happen nothing is held back.  This series is superb and I highly recommend it.",1312675200,2011-08-07
4.0,"StarGate Universe reminds me of StarGate Atlantis that had so much potential that was missed.  When did we start making TV shows that had more action in them than story lines.  Here we have a great premise for a story line that could go on for years.  However, starting with the first episode there was no back story which leave us confused.  That is support to happen.  However, I'm half way through the first season and I'm still trying to figure that part out.  I wish they did like the Avengers movie and did a lot of background with a good amount of action.  Maybe they need to find the MASH writers for help.  Still worth the watch because it will be referred to in future StarGate movies or series.  I'm just glad Ben Browder wasn't in it.  He was good in FarScape, yet he sucked in StarGate.",1345507200,2012-08-21

4.0,"This is a candid summary of how to start out as a street dealer and ultimately rise to cartel boss told by former drug dealers, users, and drug-fighters. The film's ultimate agenda is providing an intelligent examination of our war on drugs - showing how policing is misdirected, the corruption involved due to incentives and the ability to seize property supposedly involved, its futility, abuses of citizens - eg. 'no-knock' raids and property seizures with little accountability or necessary link to reality, an expensive incarceration rate exceeding that of most other nations, and potential alternatives. I was particularly impressed by its comparisons of the harm done via tobacco. On the other hand, I wish it had also shown experiences of various policies in other nations.",1396310400,2014-04-01

Gere's performance was great as was most of the other cast members.  It would have been nice to see more of Susan Sarandon but waht she does at the end makes up for her small scene time.

2.0,"Film six unrelated films and film them separately.  Then cross-edit them all with zero continuity or interrelation and you have 360!  The idea is to come full-circle as the title states, but this does not happen here. Most film makers would just say the producers cheated.  The films are not related to each other except at the end, where there is some attempt to correlate crossover. So in watching it, the viewer is constantly wondering when the film is going to make any sense...this never happens, so is disappointing. Filmed in Slovakia, England, France, Vienna and the US we get some international flavor; but this doesn't assist the go-nowhere screenplay or storyline. The weak premise of the film is that opportunities only occur once in a lifetime and so you have to take advantage of them when you can. The screenplay has one basic premise...everyone is with the wrong partner, who they do not love...so it's time to get somebody else! All in all a weak submission, which is more the fault of a non-workable screenplay and storyline than anything else. Just another example of how one weak element in the hundreds it takes to make a film can totally screw the efforts of everyone involved!  Film making is tough!",1398556800,2014-04-27

2.0,"There is something strangely fascinating about the casting of a downward spiraling Lindsay Lohan as screen icon (and two time Oscar winner) Elizabeth Taylor. Lohan is an easy target, to be sure, so I entered into the Lifetime original movie ""Liz & Dick"" with a reasonably open mind. It's true that this TV movie was lambasted critically, but it also became one of cable's biggest ratings hits of 2012. So, if nothing else, the Lohan factor created a certain curiosity. In that way, Lifetime came out the winner. That said, I might not have expected greatness, depth, or insight out of ""Liz & Dick,"" but I did anticipate a bit of fun. With a history of cheesy and over-the-top movies, I thought this might be a genuine guilty pleasure. Highlighting the tempestuous relationship between Taylor and Richard Burton (played by Grant Bowler, now on SyFy's Defiance), there was lots of room for campy fun. Alas, this never comes to fruition. Too superficial to be truly enlightening and too serious to be much fun, ""Liz & Dick"" doesn't make much of a mark at all.The movie is centered, for the most part, around the Cleopatra shoot that put Burton and Taylor together for the first time. Not much in the way of introduction is done for either, so hopefully you know something about each career-wise to put the story into context. Taylor is a diva, Burton a charming boozer. Both are married, but are somehow drawn to one another. Looking at the movie, however, there is nothing to establish this as a grand passion or a legitimate romance. There is a mild opposites attract flirtation and suddenly they are dissolving their marriages. They get together only because they're supposed to, to heck with demonstrating any real drama or relationship building. This by-the-numbers biography is so vague and unenlightening, they try to add content by staging interludes where Taylor and Burton reminisce in spare interview sequences.If you are familiar with Burton and Taylor, ""Liz & Dick"" offers absolutely no new insight into the pair. Chances are that if you have a preexisting knowledge of this film era and a love of movies, you are already smarter than the film's screenplay. I feel like this was made as an introduction to those who have zero exposure to the actual back story. But if that's the case, the movie doesn't dig deeply enough into the dynamics of the relationship or provide anything that defines this couple as the Hollywood royalty that they were. As for the performances, the great Theresa Russell is completely wasted as Taylor's mother. Bowler is likable enough, I suppose, but doesn't have much to work with. And Lohan lacks impact as a woman that could captivate the world. Truthfully, though, it is the tepid screenplay that makes ""Liz & Dick"" so dull. As I said, this didn't have to be great but it should have been fun! KGHarris, 5/13.",1368489600,2013-05-14

4.0,"Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show's legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can't point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I'm a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn't mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black's real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I've long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black's Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season's opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha's father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I'm sure there was the temptation of a ""Big Ending,"" but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn't the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn't the most ground breaking.  And it isn't likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used ""Science as Magic"" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.",1179360000,2007-05-17
5.0,This is the best series out today. On the intelligence level of Leverage. I like shows that don't treat me like I'm some mindless drone and challenge me with plots and intrigue.  I hope it gets many years to run.,1390867200,2014-01-28

5.0,"I watched this without expectations. I mean, it's not actually a Jane Austen story. It's only a mash-up by the greatest stretch of that term. And -- cue the red flags and warning lights -- it's a mini-series.At this point, I think I've watched it at least 10 times. I absolutely LOVE this story, and the characters are wonderful. The casting is sublime.I will never look at Wickham in the same way, again. This is a wonderful spin on his character. In fact, this mini-series takes liberties with most of the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Alex Kingston (River Song in Dr. Who) presents a wonderfully dimensional Mrs. Bennet. Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Bennet is charming and more sympathetic, as well.If there's any flaw in this, it's that it ended exactly where it should. While that may sound like &#34;where's the flaw...?&#34;, the fact is, I wanted to spend more time &#34;lost&#34; in Austen.Wonderful, and highly recommended for Jane Austen fans who aren't absolute purists about the sanctity of the original story.  This is an adventure for the young woman who falls into &#34;Pride and Prejudice,&#34; as well as the viewer.",1395878400,2014-03-27
5.0,"Mix together perfect acting, incredible writing, an amazing literary foundation, and beautiful people to get Zen. First, my minor nag is the slightly awkward mixture of English and Italian accents. It's very easy to move beyond that little quirk once the stories grab ahold--and a tight grasp they have. Each of the three 90-minutes episode is a mini-movie unto itself, but each builds on its predecessors.Unlike ""White Sands"" where the hero was truly incorruptible, Aurielo Zen skirts exceptionally close to the line. His reputation of the force's virtually only honest cop is so highly recognized. I often wondered how he could reconcile some choices. How can anyone live up to such a lofty aspiration. The truth is, by way of Zen, if you bend the rules--or extort political favors--for a seemingly good cause, it's all okay. But hey, that's the character and as a viewer or reader, we have to accept it or walk away.The stories were so engaging that the tiny inconsistencies or incongruities, if noticed, are forgivable. The character-driven stories were so encompassing that it was easy to lose myself inside them.Oh, and the stories are set in Rome. And there is a fairly steamy love-affair. And there are car chases, foot chases, fights, and various states of disrobing.",1393372800,2014-02-26
3.0,"The first episode worked for me but not for my wife.  The courtroom drama is a distraction and the attorneys on both sides are real cliches.

Some of the actors who play bad guys are just awesome.  The actresses are lacking some believability in their roles like playing the bad shooting girl, dirty money person.  I thought Tim's ex-wife leaving him when she was pregnant was lame, too.  Why?  Weak.  But I will still buy the next season! And it is a good show!",1376352000,2013-08-13
5.0,I just re-watched this series for the umpteenth time. What is it that draws me back time and time again? #1 would have to be Colin Firth's performance. Has any actor ever harnessed the &#34;brooding&#34; factor better than he has as Mr. Darcy? #2 would have to be the sizzling chemistry between Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  Each of their eyes convey so many emotions that it makes my head spin.  I believe Jane Austen would be exceedingly pleased with this adaptation of her work.  I don't understand why they keep making newer versions of the book when it is virtually impossible to match the quality of this series.,1394928000,2014-03-16

4.0,"No matter how much time goes by, Gus and Shawn still attract the weirdest cases on TV. So unsurprisingly, ""Psych Season 4"" is just crammed with hilarious faux-psychic mysteries -- it gets a little dark in places and shows a few signs of wear and tear, but the rest of the season is full of werewolves, westerns and Bollywood. Well, not all in the same episode.A Vancouver ski vacation is interrupted when Shawn (James Roday) spots the brilliant art thief Pierre Despereaux, so now he and Gus (Dule Hill) must figure out a way to thwart the perfect crime. To make matters worse, Lassiter (Timothy Ormundson) is determined to capture Despereaux himself, since he's been after the thief for years.And back in Santa Barbara, the boys have a slew of other weird cases -- possible demonic possession, a murdered billionaire who asks Shawn to solve his murder, a haunted Wild West town, a drug lord, Gus' college a capella quartet, a soldier's mysterious death, a whitewater rafting disaster, tracking down Juliet's college boyfriend, a deadly virus, a shark attack, a Bollywood curse, and a man who believes he's a werewolf.On the darker side of things: Shawn ends up kidnapped by a thug during the course of a case, and must find a way to tell his friends where he is. And the gang is dragged into ANOTHER game of cat-and-mouse -- Mr Yin (""dance partner"" of the insane Yang) starts killing people in Hitchcockian style.""Psych Season Four"" is perhaps the most uneven season that this show has had thus far -- when it's good it's very VERY good, but a few of the episodes are kind of flawed (""Think Tank""). Fortunately, ""Psych"" at its worst is still a deliciously weird experience -- the writers are still exceptional at writing twisty-turny mysteries full of strange twists. AND we get to see Shawn biting a U.S. Marshal.It also has the usual ""Psych"" mix: hilarious dialogue (""My first instinct is beavers, but I'm not willing to rule out those pesky Keebler elves""), funny situations (Henry stuffing little Shawn in a car trunk, to the horror of their neighbor"") and increasingly strange cases that always turn out to be murder. Most of the season is comedy/light mystery, but the writers drop in a couple of more dramatic episodes -- and the finale is a brilliantly tangled web of murder, twisted trickery, and poignant loss.Roday's Shawn is a pop-culture Peter Pan -- charming, funny, weird and goofily immature, but he gets to show his serious, sadder side in the finale. We also see Shawn actually having a long-term relationship, and struggling to deal with the demands of a selfish girlfriend who doesn't seem to respect his work.Hill is amazing at being the ""normal"" guy who reins in Shawn's weirdness (while displaying a little of his own). And both Ormundson and Maggie Lawson get their time in the spotlight -- Lassiter gets sick of being overshadowed by Shawn and tries to solve a bizarre case the way Shawn would, and Juliet has to deal with her ex-boyfriend and brother being mixed up in crimes.""Psych Season Four"" has some rough spots, but it's still a delightful blend of mystery and comedy with the occasional spattering of darkness. Fun and crazy still.",1306540800,2011-05-28

Having a priest wanting to buck the system back in the 1950s is unique, but Sheen pulls it off with a character that will have you rooting for his originality and constant frustration with the religious system. And Stephen Rea, as Sheen's nemesis, is the guy you will love to hate. I highly recommend ""Stella Days"" to all adult audiences.",1354579200,2012-12-04
4.0,"I'm well aware that American dad has its haters, and I don't always disagree with the criticisms.  However, I really think the show keeps improving, both in writing and comedic jokes.  To me this deserves recognition as most shows rely on the same tired formula and writing, which eventually gets lazy and repetitive (see the office).  American Dad has really tried to make itself a bit better as it grows, and this season shows it.  I'm not going to argue that its shakespeare, or the best comedy going, but I give credit where credit is due.  This volume made me laugh constantly, and unlike most american dad episodes, they didn't feel quite so disposable.  If you're a fan of american dad, its a no brainer, get it, you'll love it.  If you have seen the show, and only kind of like it, this volume may surprise you, give it a chance.",1286409600,2010-10-07

3.0,"The Eclipse tells the story of Michael, a recent widower, as he begins to have disturbing visions of his nearly dead father-in-law. He shares his experiences with Lena, an author of supernatural stories. The Eclipse is a haunting supernatural drama.First, this is a drama with horror elements more than it is a pure horror film, so you should adjust your expectations if you were thinking differently. The story is, however, very creepy and haunting as it takes a more realistic approach in telling this ghost story. There are a few shocking jump-scares, but only a few. The film really tries to connect several characters and subplots, but that missed its point and hurts the film. In fact, I felt the story lacked direction and impact so some aspects were forgettable. The performances were good, nothing spectacular and nothing terrible - I think the cast was well-fitted for their roles. The music was excellent, eerily enchanting and often mesmerizing.Overall, The Eclipse has some decent horror/drama elements and a haunting soundtrack, but fails to leave an impact and is ultimately forgettable. As of 5/20/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, a rental is recommended.The Eclipse has some violence and blood. (not sure why this is Rated R).",1369094400,2013-05-21

I can only say that it probably has nothing to do with Amazon and more to do with a person's bandwidth. We live out in the rurals and sometimes our internet is crappy, and to watch a movie or a TV episode and have it start and stop a dozen times, is just too much. So, we now start a show and then pause it for 15 minutes to allow it to buffer. After that, it's smooth sailing. I figure, what the heck, so it takes an hour to watch the episode this way, but it would if we were watching it straight from the TV, but we would have to suffer through or fast forward through the commercials.

I guess that is to make the series more interesting because there probably wouldn't be much of an IRT if all the professional drivers did their thing without mishaps.  The USMC have these big over water units that ride on a cushion of air so that might be a good replacement for a ferry.  The ferry's would probably punch a hole in their hull and everyone goes in the icy cold.  Seems to me that Alaska, for instance, should be responsible for make lake crossings safer at no cost to the trucking companies.",1376438400,2013-08-14

4.0,"The Sopranos comes to Norway, or something like that. Steven Van Zandt played a fixer in the Soprano mob, and he has had a disagreement with his boss. He actually turns coat, tells the Feds what they want to know, and he goes into 'witness protection' , and he chooses Norway, Lillehammer to be exact. He knows not what he has done.More snow than he could ever have thought, when he finally lands in a not so nice house in Lillehammer. He makes his way around, and soon enough he opens a club and becomes a 'Boss' in crime in Norway. Some of the underground crime group join him, and he soon rules a portion of Norway. He tries to fit in by going hunting, and attending school to obtain a license. But, the mobster cannot leave this man, and he is soon into shady deals, strippers, guns and what have you in Lillehammer.Steven Van Zandt is also a member of Bruce Springsteen's band , and he still goes on tours. The one issue I have is the wig. Steven get a new look, please.  This series is funny I'm some places, lame in others. Frank, Van Zandt's character, is a half-a**** boss, tries to be tough, but somehow can't pull it off all the time. Women seem to be attracted to him, why, I don't know, power? The other characters are good in their parts, and they play them to the hilt. Good on, Netflex, for pushing this series. Fuggitaboutit!Recommended. prisrob 02-13-14",1392249600,2014-02-13

4.0,"My wife and I listened to the CD audio version of Under The Dome and I actually purchased the Kindle Version of the book and later on read it again. Having the story burned into my mind by hearing and reading it I can hardly fully accept the TV version of the show. I enjoyed the book and the personalities and conflicts between the characters and the book for me actually got better as the story progressed.The TV show plot, script and character personalities are very much different from the book. It is a twisted version of the story and I like the TV show but I don't love it. I rate it as a 4 star item. If I had not read and listened to the book I might have rated it higher but I cannot get over the mental picture of Barbie the book character being so different in the TV series.I am surprised that Stephen King would let his book be twisted the way it has been. I don't see how the script of the TV series improves the story at all and in fact it seems to me to be a diminished version of the story. Don't get me wrong. The TV series is OK but for me the book was better. So much has changed in the story that it almost doesn't seem like the same story except for the name of the town, characters and there is a dome.It is worth watching the series but I also recommend that if you like reading Stephen King's books that you also get and read the book.",1379203200,2013-09-15

3.0,"I like MOB movies/shows. If this show didn't have that, I probably would only give this review 2 or maybe 1 star. There are too many flaws that make this show predictable.I.E. - Someone needs to get some info from an office so they place gum on the lock so the latch on the door won't catch. They then wait for the secretary to leave and close up the office. You can clearly see that the doors are glass and has a keyed lock. The doors cannot lock unless with a key. But when she leaves she just lets the doors close and doesn't lock them with a key.Every episode is about a murder that has been committed. In real life we know that suspects will lie forever and rarely admit that they did the crime . But when Dennis Quaid gets a suspect, after talking with them for only a minute they openly admit they committed the crime. He actually asks them, &#34;You did it, didn't you&#34;? And they immediately say  &#34;Yes&#34;. WOW!! I guess he solved that one.Plus, this takes place in the 1960's. And like every other show on TV today, God forbid if we blame a minority for anything. Same with this show. The minority's are always misunderstood and never do anything wrong and the whites are at fault for everything.Don't get me wrong, I am NOT saying that white's don't do anything bad; it's just that TV shows are so afraid to blame anyone else BUT white's because certain minority's will get offended.Get real.",1405123200,2014-07-12

3.0,As someone who loves history I enjoy a lot of aspects of this show.  Its filled with historical tidbits and interesting locations.  During the episodes there are frequent references to ghost (people who have seen paranormal things are interviewed) and they talk about how the history of a place could create a ghostly disturbance - but it never really rises to a real &#34;ghost show.

4.0,"This was on of the best if not the best movies that I've seen to come from Spain. Just about every element of this movie was crafted with loving hands that put the finishing touches on each and every scene before you and I would ever see it. The acting from Laura  played by (Rueda) was very good as her emotions changed from a loving mother to a panicked, distraught woman on the edge after the disappearance of her son Sim'on. The other case members also give good performances, but Rueda is the standout in this movie. The director worked magic with his cast and crew to bring this story to life from the beautiful orphanage remodeled into the families home. The cinematography was noting short of spectactular from inside the home to the beach and cave to the shots in town where the accident occurs. The mood was thick enough to cut with a knife and is so seldom seen in movies of this genre where mood can make or break a movie. The writer and director were able to turn words into this increadible work of visual and audio art. My only real issues with this movie is it seemed to drag a bit at times and the tension buildup was not always rewarding or paid off (ok we heard that but?). I would have liked to of seen more from the ghosts prespectives than was shown. I don't need tons of cgi or gore to make a story good, but I do need payment and thats where this looses a few points. Did it ruin the story/movie? Not at all. It was just not as exciting/terrifying as it could have been. What happens to their child is a good and bad twist to the story and again kind of a let down after all that happens to the family and especially to Laura.Rating 0 to 5Story = 4Acting = 4+Direction = 4+Mood = 4+Fear/Chreepy Factor = 3.3Gore = 2 One scene was gorySex/Nudity= No/NoEntertainment Value = 4++",1375574400,2013-08-04

4.0,"Rome has clearly inspired Showtime to produce this miniseries in 10 one hour parts, portraying Henry VIII's more youthful and vigorous days.  The timespan is a small one, from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon, to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn... so we only get to wife number 2 - plenty of scope for sequels, but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.As it is, the key players here are Henry VIII, in his low 20's, fighting fit and clearly horny (there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season).. Cardinal Wolsey (played with great presence by Sam Neill) the corrupt but efficient First Minister, and Sir Thomas More, the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances, well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.It falls short of Rome's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama - the scenes of `Real' England, the bars and backstreets, are only rarely seen, but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times.  Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty, may well have helped accentuate the drama.Having said that, and despite a few forgivable departures from history, this works well as a refresher on Tudor history, and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.Kudos to Showtime, and I await the next series with bated breath..Extras are modest, but rewarding - a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets, and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London, all moderately interesting.  A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition, but is lacking.Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series - a cunning plan, and a welcome one.",1209168000,2008-04-26

1.0,"Since it was a FREE show I clicked and watched. I really tried to get into this show, being a fan of this genre and all, but nope it sucked. I will not be buying Season 2. Same ole' plot Hollywood tends to lace EVERY piece of crap movie/series they create with. They can write a show about Neanderthals (cavemen) and it would be the same crap (oh wait, they did!).....I can name at least 15 movies that are EXACTLY the same as this ole' mess. Besides that, the show was very violent & bloody. I understand that Vikings were filthy disgusting uncivilized feral savages, but d@mn! I felt some kind of way, about seeing a room full of defenseless cowering &#34;Priests&#34; being butchered while crying & begging for their lives (anyone who enjoyed that, and judge me for not, is nothing but a sick sadist) Then the horrific scene at that Viking temple (good lawd!) Seriously, the &#34;fake blood&#34; expense must have accounted for a 3rd of the budget. I found nothing likable about ANY of the characters on this show.... I smh at how these Hollywood writers (as always) try to make the villains look favorable (but then this is part of the &#34;agenda&#34; to further desensitize people to violence & sexual situations). That Ragnarock (whatever his name was) and his crew were nothing but a bunch of savage serial killers & rapist. I also REALLY didn't enjoy looking at dirty sweaty greasy gross lice infested people who looked like they smelled like cattle. Whom all slept in the same beds & had sex in the same room where their children were sleeping. I keep seeing reviews comparing this show to &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;. G.O.T is messy & bloody with similar plots, but between the two, G.O.T is 5-Stars compared to this one.For all of you that feel the need to defend Viking culture & the like. If HALF of what I've read about Viking culture is true, there is absolutely NOTHING to be proud of being a descendant of these people. They were horrible violent feral savages both male & female.P.S. I couldn't careless about those of you that have nothing better to do than criticize peoples 1-Star reviews. So !@&# you in advance. Good night.",1392163200,2014-02-12

5.0,"Some of the best horror films released in 2013 never got the benefit of a theatrical or DVD release, and &#34;Contracted&#34; stands tall in the ranks of those unheralded gems. Owing a debt to David Cronenberg's &#34;Rabid,&#34; this films also deals with the deterioration of a woman's body and mind as she slowly undergoes a metamorphosis into something primal and inhuman. Strong on gore, solid on story and featuring above-average acting, this one is highly recommended.

He attacks street meat with the same verve and enthusiasm (probably more) as he does when sitting down to a meal with a Michelin star attached. The shows are always informative and usually amusing.

4.0,"Over at `The Film Experience', Nathanial Rogers (possibly the best Oscar internet blogger out there) has been posting a ""Best In Show"" column for certain actors (or actresses) in films and while watching `Two Lovers' I felt inspired to write my own.When considering the film `Two Lovers', first time viewers may immediately suspect that the two Oscar names (Joaquin Phoenix and Gwyneth Paltrow) would be the obvious choices for `best is show' praise, but upon the actual viewing it is apparent that there is one performance so subtle yet so alarmingly in tune with her character that one cannot help but obsess over her.Yes, I'm talking about Vinessa Shaw.Vinessa plays Sandra, a young and kind hearted woman who seeks out a relationship with Leonard.  Sandra's father has recently conducted a business merger with Leonard's father, and after a brief observance (Sandra sees Leonard asking his mother to dance while at work) she asks her father to set up a meeting between them.  She thinks he is cute.  Leonard has problems (serious ones that involve the cancellation of a wedding and multiple suicide attempts) but these are aspects of his tortured soul that intrigue Sandra.  She wants to help him, to heal him.When they first meet her candor is endearing.  She is not as shy or reclusive as Leonard, but she has a natural unnaturalness about her demeanor.  When she feels that maybe her advances are not being met with approval she immediately recants, pulling back and apologizing for him, basically telling him not to worry about not wanting to `date' her until he leans in and kisses her and she is consumed.""Oh my god.""  Those were her words.  She utters that phrase twice in the film and both times carry so much internal weight.As their relationship grows you can see a spark in Sandra, but that spark is corroded by a `knowing', a sixth sense if you will, that something is not right.  When Leonard is getting strange phone calls and becoming more and more reclusive, pulling away yet never saying what it is that is truly on his mind, you can see that Sandra knows, but she is unwilling to confront it for fear of losing him.  She doesn't want it to be real.That's why the second ""oh my god"" carries so much weight, because you can tell that she isn't quite sure she believes her own eyes.While `Two Lovers' is, sadly, more about one lover (that lover being Michelle, the generically clich&eacute;d `troubled girl'), the one who stays with you through every frame is Sandra.  Sure, she is vanilla while Michelle (Leonard's drug addicted neighbor who is shacking up with a married man and almost instantaneously becomes Leonard's sole obsession) is certainly not, but the textural approach that Shaw took to this character makes her scream to life.  She understands how to make Sandra's love for Leonard seem real and sincere.Now that I've devoted much of my praise to a singular performer, I guess I should weigh in on the movie itself.  While I found it stirring and most defiantly engaging, there are things about `Two Lovers' that felt off kilter.  Leonard as a character is a little two unstable and underdeveloped.  We know there is tragedy there, and Phoenix does a remarkable job of balancing his characters `new life' with the `old one' (this is far from a melodramatic downer), but the script doesn't really allow for us to KNOW who Leonard really is or understand why these women are so into him.  I felt that shifting focus to the relationship between Leonard and Michelle was a mistake, for the real emotional crux of the film is between Leonard and Sandra.  The ending, while not surprising (I totally saw that coming) can read a little false, but it also was one of those moments where, upon reflection, probably says more about Leonard as a person than any other moment in the film.He doesn't really know what he wants.The film is flawed, but it is also memorable.  It is quiet yet it has moments that sting and stay with you.  It also has Shaw.  Oh how I weep for her lack of awards attention last year.",1288915200,2010-11-05

5.0,"This show is back and it's better than last season. Everyone has returned for more and better storage units.The show tried to introduce a little twist in this season by showing us a new character, Mark. He is only in there for a few shows, but he made a statement. He is this really big/strong guy that has millions and he likes to push out the other characters out with his money. If he wants it, there's no unit he would not buy.  He's loaded and he will just go higher and higher if somebody else wants it. The other characters think they can make him lose out on the units by bidding higher and making him pay for it, but Mark seems like he just doesn't care. Compared to other characters, they can't afford to bid too much as they need to make some kind of money, but Mark isn't like that. To him, it's more of a game than a real job.Towards the end of the season, the show tried again to show another new character, Nabila. She is in the show way more and more so she can be a regular as she isn't new to the game. She said, she been in the game for over 20 years and she knows what she is doing. She is pretty and she does do more work than Brandi does in terms of moving stuff around. Of course, she doesn't like the other characters and the other characters don't like her either. Dave and Nabila seemed to have mutual respect for each other as they both have similar goals, but they bid on each other to a certain degree. You can't say that for the others though, they go buck wild on each other.As in the last season, Barry is the only one that can get along with all the regular characters on the show. There's just something about him that doesn't get on peoples nerves as the other characters hate everyone else there. I think it's because he not there to make it rich as compared to the others and he keeps a lot of stuff. Also, he tends to give away stuff. Finally, he doesn't bid too hard on the people bids. Everyone just got to love this guy!It's kind of sad though that Barry is the only one that can get hurt the most doing this job. He is always seen coming close to geting hit or something he can't hold onto he just lets it fall, which is better than him getting hurt. But...in one of the show, he does get hurt! It was very surprising to see that as it was the first time that it has really happened.",1338940800,2012-06-06

In search of Bigfoot, Seasons 1-4, and they never find Bigfoot, and all they can provide is about a dozen blurry photos or videos and a couple of eye shine shots!

Never fear, though; they found another mine coincidentally that's even bigger and scarier than the first. But will the execs sign off on it? Probably. This is why MGM sacked good quality shows like Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis for low budget garbage like this.

5.0,"Focusing on the lives of physicists, and geeky ones at that, does make for an atypical television series, but a great cast, original characters, and high quality writing, combine to produce a modern comedic gem.  Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, it understandably took a little while for the creative team to develop the personalities of the characters.  But once the basic parameters were set, The Big Bang Theory began to boldly go where no comedy has gone before.With characters that always seem to be evolving, the series explores some unusual topics, and frequently heads into uncharted territory, usually making it impossible to predict what may happen.  This is one of the main reasons why this unique, goofy, show is so hilarious and captivating.  The creative team taps into facets of pop culture that may be associated with geeks and nerds (and teenage boys in general), and find ways to weave them into their stories, often in an exaggerated way.  Science fiction, comic books, superheroes, video games, television, action figures, paint ball fights, Star Wars, and the Star Trek universe, are just a few of the subjects that are featured.The cast is marvelous, with Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter, the shy guy enchanted by his new neighbor.  Jim Parsons is Sheldon Cooper.  If you look up the word neurotic, Sheldon's photo just might be there.  Simon Helberg is Howard Wolowitz, the delusional sleaze, who does still have his good points.  Kunal Nayyar is Rajesh Koothrappali, who can't speak to a beautiful woman unless he is under the influence of alcohol.  Kaley Cuoco is Penny, the girl from Omaha who moved next door, works at the Cheesecake Factory . . . . and changed their universe.Since Sheldon is off the scale when it comes to weirdness (what Penny would later come to describe as `whackadoodle'), and Wolowitz and Raj are arguably more `abnormal', Leonard seems the most sensible of the bunch.  Sheldon is totally unique, so bizarre in his beliefs, behavior and speech, that he seems at times to be from another planet.  Jim Parsons is a amazing comic talent, with a bright, bright future.Penny has a multi-faceted role.  One is as the primary female character, another is that she usually represents as close to a 'normal' persons' point of view as we will get.  As a link to reality, she is often the reference that shows just how wacked out the guys really are.  The times when she joins them in their world (such as when she fragged Sheldon on Halo night), are often some of the program's funniest moments.  By the end of the season, everything about the show is clearly peaking.  In `The Pancake Batter Anomaly', Sheldon gets sick, and Penny gets stuck taking care of him, rubbing Vaporub on his chest, and singing `Soft Kitty'.  In `The Bat Jar Conjecture', it's Sheldon's team versus the rest of the gang and Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), in the Physics Bowl.  Sheldon's knockout of a twin sister arrives and makes waves, in `The Pork Chop Indeterminacy'.  Sheldon gets a look in the mirror, in `The Jerusalem Duality' when a young genius arrives on campus.  In `The Nerduana Annihilation', when Leonard buys the time machine used in the classic 60's film `The Time Machine' on eBay, Penny's  astute description is that `It looks like something that Elton John would drive through the Everglades'.  In the season finale, there's a glimmer of hope for romance for Leonard, in `The Tangerine Factor' when Penny agrees to go out with him.The Big Bang Theory is simply one of the most engaging comedies to come along in years.  Each episode seems to fly by, and leave you wanting more.  Some commentary tracks would have been cool, but the only bonus is the `Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory' a look at the creators, cast, and genesis of the show.  There are only seventeen episodes in the First Season due to the writers' strike.Things only get better in the second season, as the show's creative team continue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.  As Sheldon Cooper might say, it is a foregone conclusion that the third season will be characterized by the same outstanding writing, and brilliantly quirky humor found in the first two seasons, continuing to keep The Big Bang Theory, at the cutting edge of contemporary comedy.",1245888000,2009-06-25

5.0,"For the second season of this wonderful mystery/comedy show, the producers wisely left things pretty much alone.  Shawn Spenser (James Roday) comes from a long line of cops.  But he rebelled against his father's (Corbin Bernsen) wishes and didn't become a cop.  Instead, he pretends to be a psychic, using his finely honed observation skills to get the information for his ""visions.""  He's even opened Psych, a psychic detective agency with best friend Burton ""Gus"" Guster (Dule Hill).  And he has an impressive track record, much to the dismay of Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundsun).  Rounding out the cast are Santa Barbara Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Interim Chief of Police Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson).And what a collection of cases they have this year, too.  Shawn and Gus join the TV sensation American Duos to find out who is trying to kill the head judge (played by Tim Curry).  They become models to find out who killed both partners of a fashion house.  Shawn must clear Gus' parents of murdering the neighborhood crank.  When Gus' uncle (guest star John Amos) comes for a visit, Shawn and Gus have to switch places, without the police figuring out that both of them are faking it.  Equally complicated is a case where a real psychic is brought in and Shawn must keep his secret from her.  Shawn puts his credibility on the line by claiming one victim was killed by a dinosaur.  And in the season finale, Shawn pins the crime on a mummy.This show has real come together and is firing on all pistons now.  The mysteries are tight and confusing.  I might piece things together a little before Shawn, but not by much.  And it doesn't matter because the entire fun is getting to the end.  The over the top physical humor has been toned down this year (and that's a good thing), but there is still plenty of laughs.  You've got cultural references spewed in mile a minute dialogue by Shawn and Gus, comedy from the character's relationships, comedy from the situations, and some physical humor.  I can't stop myself from laughing out loud while I watch this show.  And the cast does a great job holding it all together.  They bring high energy to each episode, but they keep it real.If you have missed this show, you have definitely missed out.  Don't let another day go by without becoming a fan.",1215648000,2008-07-10

Because basically Red John was just that mean.Jane then goes on to join a police department as a consultant and for years they've danced around who / what Red John is / was.It's been entertaining, a goodly amount of humor, some reasonably intelligent plots, good characterization and interactions.Well, this season they close out the Red John plot line and came up with a way for Jane to continue.Had wondered if they could pull it off or not, but so far the plots continue to be entertaining, though you have to wonder at a person with Jane's purported intelligence working for a bunch of (technical term) douche bags that comprise the FBI.Some of the plots are starting to get a bit thin;  One episode, a guy (off screen, most violence that occurs is off-screen or tastefully handled) is chopped to pieces on top of a building and planted in some potted ferns....

IfMiffyandMonkeyhad a child, that child would be Adventure Time!There's also an amazing range in the &#34;feel&#34; of the individual episodes. Just in season two alone, that spans the gamut from &#34;The Chamber of Frozen Blades&#34;, a kind of affectionately absurdist homage to the ninja movie craze of the early 80's, to the far deeper but still almost equally playful &#34;Death in Bloom&#34;. In this latter episode our heroes must undertake a classic journey into the underworld. The only difference is, in their case it's to retrieve the soul of a houseplant!In this season we also get to see both the land of Ooo and the psyches of some of its leading characters explored in significantly greater depth. I'm particularly thinking here of the season opener &#34;It Came From The Nightosphere&#34;, as well as &#34;Susan Strong&#34;, and the climactic two-part season finale, &#34;Mortal Folly&#34; and &#34;Mortal Recoil&#34;. The mind of the Ice King in particular may well be unique in all of television: for he is at once a complete sociopath and completely human, with all of humanity's need for love and friendship.Watching an episode of Adventure Time unfold is like poetry. Still more so when you get to see whole seasons, because it's then that you get to appreciate the full range the creators are capable of. I've heard New Zealand novelist Janet Frame quoted as saying that &#34;a good novel should exercise all the muscles of the heart and mind&#34;.That's what you get in a full season of Adventure Time.Theo.",1362182400,2013-03-02

Each Character offers potential for deep exploration in a myriad of directions, and situations, revealing enough to  bait the Viewer's attention before transitioning to a different Scene, and circumstances. A truly promising glimpse into a wealth of entertaining adult possibilities to look forward to.

3.0,"i've watched this for weeks.  i started out liking it, chiefly for Williams' comedic riffs. I will not be watching any longer, however, as . the show just doesn't have enough substance to it. Williams plays the head of his own ad agency.  he is surrounded by young employees, including his daughter.  none of these other characters are funny though.  he is trying to carry the whole show but can't quite pull it off. most episodes involve a client who needs a new ad and the whole agency scrambles to come up with something that works. (it reminds me more of BEWITCHED than MAD MEN but sadly there is no great witch). those scenes are marginally successfully because Williams is ""on"". unfortunately, the other scenes are about the four younger people's personal lives and these scenes are cringe inducing.  it has been awhile since I have seen comedic scenes this bad and this unfunny.  there is so much that is good on tv nowadays when you factor in cable and foreign tv that this kind of so-so network show has become very easy to just turn off.",1380326400,2013-09-28

The headlines and punch lines came so fast I didn't have the time to process them to remember for this review. Could they keep up the pace for a multi-episode series?

That's what this show is.The comedy in this show was crude and predictable. Most of the main characters weren't even likeable. If this was to get picked up, if they continue with the same tone as the pilot, I'd expect more of the same.The only reason that this series even gets 2 stars is because of the Fox Sports Sunday crew and Billy Dee Williams being on the pilot episode.",1392508800,2014-02-16

4.0,"Back in 2007 I was in Toronto and met some guys who screened Demons 2 one night.  Before the film began they showed a collection of film trailers for Argento films, spaghetti westerns and such, and then the original HOBO trailer played.  It was a wonderfully done trailer that rivaled the ones used in the Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse film.  The director was present in the theater but I didn't speak to him then(too bad), but I always remembered the trailer.  I never thought it would actually become a feature film, let alone star Rutger Hauer.So here we are-Hobo With A Shotgun is a reality, and the exploitation world is the better for it.  Basically it's about a hobo that comes into a crime ridden town and decides to go Bronson when he's seen(and experienced) enough.  The town in the movie is super exaggerated in it's criminal activity-it's a friggin' warzone!  Think of the gang ruled neighborhood in Death Wish 3 and that's how this entire town is!  But then again, everything here is exaggerated.  This movie is very cartoony and brings to mind images of Troma(in fact, a character in the film is wearing a Troma shirt in one scene).  Rutger Hauer is the odd one out in that he's basically the ""normal"", non-cartoon character here.  And that really makes it work.  His downplaying against everyone else's over the top playing really helps give the movie that additional edge to bring it above being total silliness(along with the hot young lady who plays the prostitute.  I forgot her name at the moment).  We all love Hauer, you'd have to be some kind of communist not to.  Though he's been in numerous B movies throughout the years, we've never seen him in something quite like this, something more tongue in cheek.  Movies like Bleeders, Crossworlds and Turbulence 3-Heavy Metal were schlock, but schlock taking itself a bit more seriously.  It's a nice change of pace for Hauer.The film has a decent amount of gore.  Some say it surpasses Machete.  I'm not sure if it does.  Perhaps, but unlike Machete, the gore here is not CGI, which elevates it substantially.The second disc(if you're thinking of buying the 2 disc version) has a nice Making Of.. documentary, interviews with Hauer and director Eisener by Fangoria magazine, the alternate ending, and the original fake trailer(though this may be on disc one, I forgot).  I haven't watched the film on ""Shotgun Mode"" yet, so I'm not sure on that one.All in all, a very good ""grindhouse"" style film here.  Usually these modern throwback movies leave alot to be desired and make you wish you had used your time to watch an actual grindhouse movie instead of these weak imitations.Hobo With A Shotgun is one to be proud of the grindhouse throwback status.  It earns it.",1310169600,2011-07-09

4.0,"""Arbitrage"" (2012 release; 100 min.) stars Richard Gere as Robert Miller, the owner and CEO of Miller Capital, a Wall Street investment firm. Soon enough into the movie, we learn that Miller has all kinds of business and relationships issues/problems, and in fact each of these problems could've easily by themselves filled a whole movie: from the business side, it appears that Miller's firm is mysteriously short $412 million just at a time when the firm is about to be sold at a large profit. Miller borrows the funds to cover up the hole, but that puts only more pressure on him as the lender now wants the loan repaid. From the personal side, Miller is having an affair with Julie, a French up-and-coming art gallery owner. Late one night, as Miller and Julie are diving off, Miller nods off, causing the car to flip over and Julie is accidentally killed. Miller decides to flee the scene.At that point we're maybe 20 min. into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would truly ruin your viewing experience. The tension does not let up, as we watch and wonder (i) whether Miller can pull off the sale of his company despite all of the financial and accounting irregularities, and (ii) whether Miller will be able to get away with the accidental death of Julie. You'll just have to see it for yourself how it all plays out.Several commments: this is the first feature from writer-director Nicholas Jarecki, and he shows a lot of talent and promise. At times the movie felt very Hitchcock-like. Second, the acting performances are excellent throughout, but there are two I'd like point out: Richard Gere, of course, now at age 63 and in his best role since ""Unfaithful"" in 2002, and he is already being mentioned as a serious candidate for a Best Actor Oscar nomination; and also Brit Marling, who plays the Ivanka Trump-reminding role of Miller's daughter and right-hand person in the company. I saw her earlier this summer in the excellent indie movie ""Sound of My Voice"" (which she also co-wrote and produced) and she is rapidly rising amoung the ranks of today's female actresses (except that she also directs, writes and produces!). Keep an eye out for her, as she is definitely going places. Meanwhile ""Arbitrage"" is a thoroughly entertaining financial and crime drama. The movie house where I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was PACKED, and as Bjork's ""I See Who You Are"" starting playing over the closing credits, there was an applause from the audience indicating its approval and then some. ""Arbitrage"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1347580800,2012-09-14

5.0,"This show remains fresh and interesting. In fact the people here are interesting and you can't help but root for them. Even for the obnoxious scott who finally realized he had to go to detox. That wasn't scripted, nor are many of the actual dives, and things like the christine rose having trouble getting back to port. Some of the relationship stuff may be scripted , I don't know. But someone dying on the show isn't and the show remains one of my favorites and I don't watch lots of reality shows. this one has a basic truth to it as they look for gold and that's more than can be said for some of the completely scripted (sorta reality)  shows like the repo ones. (which are outreageous fun to be sure but you know it's not real and it eeen says so) this is a solid show and even the loopy steve who always shoots himself in the foot with his lazy episodes , he works hard on some eps then not so hard on others but he is a engaging person and you can see that he's a really  nice guy. I hope they don't lose him next season. Although someone needs to push him harder on the dives for sure.  See? this show engages you and it makes these people worth watching. For instance:  We want emily to overcome her fear of diving because she just can't stay around for ever that way, now that may be scripted , but maybe not. However much of this show is scripted there's a huge part of it that rings true enoough to be worth your time watching it. and sadly one castmember even dies in it. another decent person , which all adds up to good viewing at a high cost.",1363392000,2013-03-16

2.0,"Mark Pellington's Sundance disaster, titled 'I Melt With You', is one of the strangest, incredibly maddening and tonally challenged films that I have seen all year. There are pros and cons - more of the latter than the former - and it is easy to see why so many critics have slashed it to bits. With that being said, it is certainly not as bad as everyone thinks it is, but it could have been a whole hell of a lot better.The film focuses on the yearly reunion of four friends who went to college together in the eighties. Every one of these individuals somehow failed to live the dream, and as a result, they have taken questionable paths in life. Over the course of a drug-filled week, the men reminisce on the past, proceed to wax philosophical on the present, listen to the music of their youth, party with girls, drink obscene amounts of hard liquor, snort mountains of coke, and pop every pill known to mankind. Between this foursome, moments of sobriety are extremely rare - the main characters remain intoxicated for at least two thirds of the running time.The 'Big Chill' meets 'Scarface' vibe comes to a screeching halt when one of the men, racked with guilt over the death of his lover, commits suicide - a tragic occurrence which is partially linked to a pact the four men made twenty five years ago, which all of them, save for one, managed to forget. You read that correctly. Twenty five years prior to this particular reunion, these boys made a binding promise to one another - a contract, signed in blood. When the film reveals exactly what the promise entails, it is a shocking discovery.This begins a downward spiral that neither one of them can escape. It is here that the tone of the film changes for the worse, and as a result, becomes more than a bit preposterous. The cast includes Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay. The performances are hit (Christian McKay) and miss (just about everyone else, especially Thomas Jane).The first half of the film is pretty decent, and I was disappointed to see it devolve so quickly. What could have been an extremely provocative study of broken dreams and arrested development becomes a hopelessly melodramatic pile of drivel.Rated R, 122 minutes, directed by Mark Pellington, released by Magnolia Pictures. Available on Blu-ray and DVD on February 28th from Magnolia Home Entertainment.",1329523200,2012-02-18

4.0,I find the show funny and in some cases so true to life.  Its nice to watch something thats not a reality show.  Daria shows its not bad to be yourself whoever or whatever you want to be.,1385164800,2013-11-23
4.0,"This pilot had a lot of laughs and some cool characters.  It was really, really absurdist and more than a bit frenetic.  It jumped quickly from one crazy, improbable thing to the next.  The combination of really chaotic plot-driven comedy with lots of random ""Onion headlines"" worked well, although it seems like that is a delicate balance to keep.  I loved Jeffrey Tambor and Cheyenne Jackson in this.  The one thing I am a bit worried about is that the characters seem a bit too shallow and 'caricaturey' (if that is a real adjective).  I think that can work for something more short-form, but I am a bit worried about whether I will care about any of the characters over the course of an entire season of episodes.Nevertheless, I am definitely interested in seeing more.",1366502400,2013-04-21
5.0,I like for  my grandson to watch Cailou because there is parent interaction with the child.  So many of these children shows have and understood parent influence but you never see the parent.,1397952000,2014-04-20
1.0,"I've purchased the first couple episodes, but, there is no &#34;up&#34; in this show like there is in Pretty Little Liars. While taken from the same book series, this one is just gloomy, without interesting characters to perk it up. Heck, not even fun to just look at the ridiculous clothes like on Pretty Little Liars. I'll be waiting for the Netflix version.",1386028800,2013-12-03

4.0,"I'm not really into ""cop"" shows or ""detective"" shows that dominate network t.v. because they are usually dull, predictable, depressing, and totally lacking any humor.  ""In Plain Sight""  doesn't suffer from these problems.Luckily, I stumbled across this series last summer.  The main character is a Federal Marshall who is involved in the Witness Protection program.  She has to keep her clients safe and solve murders based upon her client's testimony.  She and her partner Marshall have great chemistry together on-screen.If you're a fan of ""Burn Notice"" you will enjoy this series as well; although they are different shows, what they share in common is humor, action, and great characters which are well written.  The writers also explore the personal dramas of the main characters which makes for an interesting back-story.Season 2 premieres April 2009 on USA network for existing fans of the show- for those that are curious and have never watched the show, rent/buy season 1 on dvd and you'll be up to speed when season 2 starts.** highly recommended **",1234396800,2009-02-12

4.0,"The premise of this show is a good one for spy-story fans. The episode plots are also quite good.

1.0,"This satiric take on the epic mini-series of the seventies and eighties is a one trick, one joke pony. The idea is to make fun of the tropes and melodrama of the epic, best selling, historical romances that proliferated during the period. All of the familiar elements are present: the wealthy but troubled family with secrets, their home, sometimes with hints of the gothic that represents a character in itself, unrequited love, revenge, death, business and wealth.In the real world, there is the mineable territory of Hollywood with its excesses and egotistical stars, directors and writers. S of B takes them all on, making fun of the mini-series and novels that it lampoons. Conclusion? These books and the productions based on them were melodrama that took themselves far too seriously and had quality issues of writing, directing, acting and production. That's it. That's the joke....full stop.I could get on board if I was getting a decent story and characters supporting the joke, but we don't because to give good story and characters the production team would have to resort to the techniques and tropes of  the genre they're satirizing and they can't do that because that would cut the legs from under their one joke pony. Not recommended as story or satire.",1391731200,2014-02-07

5.0,"Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  As far as current TV comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than &#8220;Always Sunny,&#8221; and these first two seasons show it.",1389139200,2014-01-08
4.0,"I like most of the story line, although the story jumps all over the place. Most of the shows these days are written like soap operas. Its like all of the writers are smoking blunts.

I'm afraid I'll have a heart attack with every show. It's scary, it's awesome. You love the characters: Nick! Munroe! And Hank is going to be a revelation this season. The Juliet storyline (seriously, is her name supposed to point to star-crossed lovers?) is heart-breaking because Nick is such a lovable (and kick ass) character. This season, you can see that Nick OWNS being a Grimm like he never has before. It's amazing how he can balance being this clean-cut, good guy hero and at the same time be so fierce in battle.",1346371200,2012-08-31

3.0,"The opening of this show was a little slow, with some very predictable jokes about corruption in government. Some moments sounded very much like a Garry Trudeau comic, and at times I felt they were set up much like a comic: as tableaux where people would give dryly witty lines. Then, as the characters began to get more active -- to move around more and actually get involved in some action -- the show worked better. I'd like to see more of this show and this cast, and I hope that if it gets picked up Trudeau remembers to incorporate action and movement to his masterful wit.Alyce",1368576000,2013-05-15

5.0,"What continues to amaze me about &#34;Falling Skies&#34; is how much story and character development can be accomplished in just 10 episodes per season.  Whereas the &#34;old format&#34; of TV shows was to produce 20-25 episodes per season, the &#34;new format&#34; is to only see about 10-13...but completely cut out the &#34;filler&#34;!  In the case of &#34;Falling Skies&#34;, the creators of this show have made pacing an art form.  In &#34;just&#34; the 10 episodes included in this set, it seems like an entire season (or more!) has transpired.For a basic plot summary (minor spoilers ahead), when Season One of &#34;Falling Skies&#34; signed off, Tom Mason (Noah Wyle) had boarded an alien spacecraft with a &#34;fish-head&#34;.  His experiences (and, most importantly, repercussions of those experiences) comprise a large portion of this season.  Another main plot point: General Weaver (Will Patton) learns of a potential alien resistance in Charleston.  Should he lead the 2nd Mass there, or is it just a fantasy?  Also this season, Ben Mason (Connor Jessup) takes on a much larger role, as his history with being harnessed makes him an important cog in a potential alien revolution from within.Basically, this second season of &#34;Falling Skies&#34; is just as good as the first, if not maybe a bit better (although they are both five-star efforts).  The action is still vibrant, the plots move along at a brisk pace, and the characters continue to develop even though they are &#34;household names&#34; now.  I will be starting Season Three as soon as I have the opportunity!",1404432000,2014-07-04
5.0,"The basic idea is that Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is faking a background as a Harvard Law graduate in a prestige NYC law firm.  He is able to bring this off with the help of a Sr, Partner in the firm, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht).  The premise is preposterous, No decent firm, much less a high priced Manhattan one, is going to hire an associate without at least a superficial check of his credentials.  Plus before long half of Manhattan seems to know Mike&#8217;s &#8220;secret&#8221;, including the managing partner of the firm (Gina Torres).  This puts her and the Macht character in the position of actively perpetrating a fraud on their million-dollar clients.  Not likely.OK, so why five stars?  Because the acting is noticeably above average especially the three leads and Rick Hoffman as the comic villain (I keep expecting him to say &#8220;Curses, foiled again&#8221;).  The characters are engaging and the writing is usually smart if sometimes silly.  But the shows big secret, I think, is that it maintains a level of dramatic tension and never stops to take a breath.  It is really fun to watch Ross and Specter &#8211; gunfighters hurling through the world of corporate law, firing citations from the hip and dropping arrogant competitors right and left.  It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that most of the employees at the firm look like former calendar models.",1396742400,2014-04-06

5.0,"Tim Roth stars as Dr. Cal Lightman, a no-nonsense expert in lie detection who heads The Lightman Group, a Washington D.C.-based team of likeminded professionals who help solve crimes and mysteries by analyzing the facial expressions and behavior of the various individuals involved.Lightman and his partner, Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams) are primarily assisted by their young protegees, researcher Eli Loker (Brendan Hines) and Ria Torres (Monica Raymund), a newcomer who was specially chosen for her innate ability to spot lies without any prior training.Of course, a negative aspect of being so finely tuned to the nuances of human behavior means seeing things in family and friends, even when you might not always want to -- as Lightman has learned the hard way with his ex-wife Zoe (Jennifer Beals). He and Foster have an often-repeated agreement not to ""cross the line"" when dealing with one another. Yet when you genuinely care about someone, and interact regularly, it's often difficult to keep your eyes closed and mouth shut.Particularly memorable episodes include ""Depraved Heart,"" where Cal investigates the back-to-back suicides of two Indian sisters -- and reveals something startling about the reason he first got into lie detection -- and ""Blinded,"" where the group tries to find out who's copycatting a serial rapist's brutal assaults before the next woman is assault -- and one of their own is threatened.This drama provides a great blend of workplace mysteries and personal issues, as well as a number of red herrings (Lightman himself being the master).

In this series, he is excellent. I'm not sure he played an Italian well or not (since I know so few native Italians). The clues were laid out precisely and scattered throughout each episode in such a way to keep my interest and keep me guessing. I love that. Caterina Murino is a very beautiful woman and acted her part perfectly. I was disappointed that she is a mere secretary.

4.0,"From creators Shawn Ryan (""The Shield"", ""Welcome to Hollywood"", ""The Unit"") and Karl Gajdusek (""Oblivion"", ""Trespass"") comes ""Last Resort"", an American military drama which aired on ABC from September 2012 to January 2013.The series would star Andre Braugher (""Homicide: Life on the Street"", ""The Mist"", ""City of Angels""), Scott Speedman (""Underworld"" films, ""Felicity""), Australian actress Daisy Betts (""Shutter"", ""Caught Inside"", ""Persons Unknown""), French actress Camille De Pazzis (""Le Premier Jour: Du Reste De Ta Vie"", Quand j'etais chanteur""), Dichen Lachman (""Dollhouse"", ""Neighbours"", ""Aquamarine""), Daniel Lissing (""Crownies""), Sahr Ngaujah (""The Signal"", ""Stomp the Yard""), Autumn Reeser (""The Girl Next Door"", ""The O.C."", ""No Ordinary Family""), Jessy Schram (""Unstoppable"", ""American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile"") and Robert Patrick (""Terminator 2&#8243;, ""The Unit"", ""Walk the Line"").While the premiere of ""Last Resort"" brought in over 9 million viewers, due to drop in viewership, ABC decided not to take on a full season but did air the 13 episodes that were created, including a season finale which would give fans closure.And now ""Last Resort: The Complete Series"" will be released on DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.""Last Resort"" revolves around the crew of the U.S. Navy Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, the USS Colorado.  The crew led by Commanding Officer Marcus Chaplin (portrayed by Andre Braugher) and Lt. Commander Sam Kendal (portrayed by Scott Speedman) pick up a U.S. Navy SEAL team off Pakistan's coast.While everything is going perfectly fine inside the USS Colorado, Lt. Grace Shepard (portrayed by Daisy Betts) receives an encoded message to launch nuclear ballistic missiles at Pakistan.But because a nuclear missiles on a country would kill millions and the fact the message came from a channel that would only be used only if the White House was destroyed, as Chaplin checks on American news, there is no mention of any problems in the United States.  So, Chaplin asks for confirmation from the U.S. government of why the order did not come in proper channels.Unfortunately, some of Chaplin's crew such as Commander Master Chief Petty Officer Joseph Prosser (portrayed by Robert Patrick) and others  question their Commanding Officer for not following direct orders to launch the nuclear missiles.Immediately, the Deputy Secretary of Defense William Curry dismisses Captain Marcus Chaplin for refusing to follow orders and Lt. Commander Sam Kendal is made acting captain. But before they launch the nuclear missiles, Kendal also requests the order to come in through proper channels.  Because of his refusal, an American tomohawk shot by the USS Illinois is sent to destroy the USS Colorado.While the USS Colorado is hit and there are a few casualties, the crew try to question why they were fired upon.  Meanwhile at the island of Sainte Marina, NATO is observing the tomohawk missile and seeing American government reporting it as missile attack by Pakistan.  In retaliation, the U.S. shoots two nuclear missiles on Pakistan.As America reports that the USS Colorado has been sunk by Pakistan, the USS Colorado rises underwater and the crew take over the Sainte Marina.  When they find out from NATO's Sophie Girard (portrayed by Camille De Pazzis) that it was the USS Illinois that attacked them, both Speedman and Chaplin are shocked.  To make things even worse, the government using other channels to communicate with other members of the crew try to get them to eliminate both Speedman and Chaplin.Knowing that their duty is to protect their crew and serve the United States, they record a video featuring Chaplin about how their intention is to protect the crew of the USS Colorado but because America tried to kill them, any country that tries to get near the perimeter near the island will be treated as the enemy.  And because there are 17 nuclear missiles, they will be used against any aggressor.So, as the USS Colorado makes Sainte Marina their main base, they must deal with the island natives who are not happy with the crew being on their island, they must deal with other countries trying to gain possession of the submarine (for its nuclear missiles) but also crew who are receiving messages from the government to eliminate Speedman and Chaplin for treason.  As the crew of the USS Colorado are also treated as criminals, Speedman and Chaplin must also deal with descending morale.Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Sam Kendal's wife Christine (portrayed by Jessy Schram) is being used by the government to get to Sam, meanwhile Kylie Sinclair (portrayed by Autumn Reeser) is trying to get information about the Perseus technology that is on the USS Colorado, a technology that she and her family built.  She knows from her govt. sources that the USS Illinois shot the Tomohawks and the USS Colorado and the USS government is involved.  But because of her knowledge, the U.S. government is watching closely over her, and worried she may be causing problems.With these growing problems, what will happen to the crew of USS Colorado?  And will they prove their innocence.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Last Resort"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions. This is one of the few drama series on television where a lot of the scenes are shot outdoors, to there is good natural lighting and the series does look good on DVD. I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the series looks very good on DVD.As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music and special effects always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes. Did notice really good surround sound use for ""Last Resort"" with surround channels and rear surround channels being used.The show is presented in English SDH, Chinese, French, Korean, Spanish and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Last Resort: The Complete Series"" includes the following special features:Making the Pilot - (4:18) A featurette on the making of the pilot.Profiles in Courage - (4:39) A featurette on the characters of ""Last Resort"" with interviews with cast and executive producers.Conn Artists - (4:29) The artists and production designer Jim Spencer and set designer Brenda Meyers-Ballard) talk about the conn room inside the submarine and how they design and built it.Anatomy of An Episode: Voluntold - (4:50) Behind-the-scenes of the making of the fourth episode ""Voluntold"" featuring director Stephen DePaul, Jessy Schram, Jay Hernandez, Andre Braugher and more.Grace Under Fire - (4:48) Dais Betts (Lt.

Who can imagine the Commanding Officer of shooting a nuclear missile near the White House?  Who can imagine how far a corrupt government would go?Yes, this is nothing new.  We have seen similar situations in dramas such as ""24&#8243;, we have seen betrayal of military members in films such as ""Platoon"", but what makes ""Last Resort"" so interesting is that it has never been done before.  A submarine carrying nuclear missiles and its crew landing in an island and literally taking it over.  An island where a drug runner has ruled hand over fist, a crew that is torn by its duty for the military without asking questions and a crew that is moralistic and would not nuke any country without a reason through proper channels.Throw in a cast of people who have their positives and negatives and you wonder how they will change, if they do change, throughout the series.Captain Marcus Chaplin, the honorable Captain who honors his country but also protects his submarine and its crew.  XO Sam Kendal, a man with honor but also a man who has been trying to find himself and possibly giving up too much of himself to the military, rather than to his wife.  Lt. Grace Shepard, the admiral's daughter but a woman who wants to prove that she got her position because of her skills and experience, not due to nepotism.Throw in characters such as the Navy SEAL James King, who he and his men are hiding the truth of what their mission was before being picked up by the USS Colorado.  Sophie Girard of NATO who has her obligations to her work but finds herself falling for XO Sam Kendal.Meanwhile at home, Kylie Sinclair tries to expose the truth about the government's lies, about a corrupt president and depending on Christine Kendal, wife of Sam, to bring out the truth of what happened to the US Colorado.And so many other characters that impact a storyline, similar to a series like ""LOST"", which may have many characters but yet, are utilized when the storyline is needed.There are so many things that could have gone wrong with ""Last Resort"" but the writing and the characters kept you coming back for more.  With that being said, it also comes down to one with an open mind, to accept things that may be farfetched or crazy.I can see some being turned off by how the series portrays a corrupt United States government.  How some may be turned off by military taking things into their own hands.  And perhaps the many characters and episode after episode of uncertainty.  Who is good?  Who is bad?  Will this crew member turn on you?  Or will the drug runners or the island natives end your life?It's not a simple series nor is the storyline simple...it features a complex conspiracy that tends to manifest until the final episode which the writers had to create closure and for the most part, they did.The series also has solid talent.  Andre Braugher does a magnificent job of playing Captain Marcus Chaplin and to see how his character evolves from beginning to end.  For Scott Speedman, it's good to see him play a role outside of ""The Underworld"" half Lycan/half vampire character or the problematic character on ""Felicity"" that he had previously been known for.Also, to see Autumn Reeser in another solid role, much different from the role that she was known for on ""The O.C."".  And it's great to see international talents such as Australian actress Daisy Betts as Lt. Grace Shepard and French actress Camille De Pazzis as Sophie Girard.As for the DVD, ""Last Resort: The Complete Series"" features good picture quality on DVD with a good amount of shots done outdoors.  Also, a soundtrack that utilizes the surround channels quite frequently.  And there are also a good number of special features included on each of the three DVD's.Overall, I will give ABC the benefit of the doubt as I have seen many canceled series never receive any closure.  I'm glad the network gave ""Last Resort"" writers a chance to end the series, the best way they can.  It's an acceptable conclusion and so for anyone wanting a military drama that will be different than anything you have seen on television, a drama that is full of excitement and intrigue, then ""Last Resort: The Complete Series"" is a military drama worth watching!Recommended!",1372896000,2013-07-04

4.0,"Season Four is a great return to form.What mesmerizes me is, even today, we can have a TV show without ending! Can can this be possible? If NBC did not want another season, they should warn the producers BEFORE they shot Season Four! This kind of attitude help us to never forget the obvious: the ratings are Gods. TV executives simply don't care about the quality or boldness of a show (in that sense, it was real miracle that Seinfeld survived its first season - not because it was bad, but because the ratings were very weak).We followed Earl for four seasons. We wanted to see the final destinies of the list, of Crabman, of Joy, Randy and all the fascinating recurring characters. But no, that was not to be. NBC killed it, and killed it without mercy.But why was that? I think that's because rating fell during Season Three, which was by far the worst, to the point that, in some episodes, I was wishing then to END, instead of whising they did not end, if you kown what I mean. But it was not crap by any standards, it was still above-average TV.Well, Jason Lee and Greg Garcia did their best.

1.0,"This &#34;movie&#34; which is shot like a made-for-television movie from the 1960's, is slow moving, boring, and uneventful.

I literally kept falling asleep.That being said, maybe this is a medical breakthrough in the making. Yes, it is clearly an effective and safe way to treat insomnia, but I believe it has an even better use.In terminal patients, one would hope they might pass calmly, even willingly.

5.0,"The cast is exceptional and the story unbelievable. The cast includes Michaela Conlin, Tamara Taylor, David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel, as well as many others of considerable talent.  Of course it is hard not to love Emily Deschanel whose portrayal of Dr. Temperance Brennen, a brilliant forensic anthropologist whose prosidy portrays her character as one with Asperger's syndrome, combining intellectual brilliance with the grace of a social pygmy who manages to not see the difference between truth and insult. She doesn't want to be mean, but she is oblivious to the meanness within her own &#34;truthful&#34; observations, at least truth as she sees it. As a scientist she is a hard-nosed empiricist who in her abrupt fashion eschews the intellectual worth both of value judgements and faith. However, she gradually comes to indulge, even appreciate, adherence to these inclinations in her friends, especially her character's eventual husband FBI agent Seeley Booth played by David Boreanaz. The tale inspires one to both laugh and do your homework.",1395273600,2014-03-20
5.0,"LAST NIGHT is a tightly woven tale that explores the psyches of four people in one fascinating evening. This is the initial directing outing for Iranian-American writer Massy Tadjedin ('The Jacket', 'Leo') who also created the story and the script: the film is so fine that we doubtless will be hearing more about her.Joanna Reed (Keira Knightley) is a beautiful young writer married to commercial real estate developer Michael Reed (Sam Worthington) in what appears to be a happy marriage despite the struggle between two careers. Michael takes Joanna to a company party and there she observes the soft spoken Michael paying attention to one of his co-workers, the sensuous Laura (Eva Mendes), an act that Joanna feels indicates unfaithfulness or at least suspicious behavior on Michael's part. The seed of doubt is planted, Michael is leaving for a business trip to Philadelphia the next morning with his coworkers Andy (Anson Mount) and Laura, and there is friction between Joanna and Michael that Michael's reassurance cannot overcome. The next day as Joanna sops for coffee she encounters an old flame from her time spent writing in Paris - Alex Mann (Guillaume Canet) - and they agree to meet that evening. Chemistry resurges and that evening as Alex and Joanna dine with Alex's publisher Truman (Griffin Dunne), both are questioned by Truman about their past affair, Joanna admits she is now married, and Alex is in a relationship in Paris. The couple leaves and circumstances lead them to return to Joanna's apartment where they face their feelings. At the same time as this evening is developing Michael and Laura enter a seduction dance: Michael is faithful to Joanna but the emotionally bruised Laura persists in her attempt to pull Michael into her web. The manner in which each of these temptations resolves and the aftermath is the brilliance of Massy's writing and direction: this is a story written very much form a women's vantage and that fact allows each of the characters to become very well defined and credible.The quartet of actors is well matched: Knightley continues to mature as a fine actress, Sam Worthington breaks out of his stodgy shell to allow us to see a man driven by fidelity and tempted by lust, Eva Mendes takes Laura to a higher dimension of being, and Guillaume Canet is undeniably an Alex who few women could resist: he has true star power. The method of pairing the development of the one night by flashing back and forth between the progress of the two couples in the dance of seduction vs fidelity is extremely successful. This is a thinking person's movie and an introduction of a writer/director who already has shaped the beginnings of a successful career. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, June 11",1307318400,2011-06-06

4.0,"Sometimes the less you know about a movie, the more pleasantly surprising it can be. I, for one, had no fore knowledge of ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" and, consequently, rather limited expectations. So when I sat down with friends and plugged ""Disappearance"" into the DVD player, I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. And for once, my pessimism about the movie's prospects were completely unfounded. After an almost wordless set-up, I was already drawn into this tight little chamber piece. Several major twists later and I was delighted to have uncovered a little known gem! With just three characters and a confined and claustrophobic set, ""Disappearance"" is theatrical (play-like, if you will) in its intimacy. But writer/director J. Blakeson uses this inherent staginess well to create a seamless thriller of lies, deceit, and plans gone wrong.I will say very little about what transpires in ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed."" Knowing the film's twists in advance may not ruin the movie's effectiveness--but, trust me, it's best just to let this one unfold. All you get from me is this--two armed and masked men take a young, wealthy woman hostage. Keeping her strapped down and helpless, they await a ransom. But all does not go according to plan, needless to say--but you probably guessed that. That's it--I'll go no further.Gemma Arterton plays the unwitting victim in this equation while Eddie Marsan and Martin Compston portray the kidnappers. Marsan is intense and Arterton is appealing, but Compston essays the most difficult role as a sort of a go-between. He is terrific, and all three actors pull their weight in this deadly triangle. But perhaps the biggest star of ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" is Blakeson's screenplay. Using standard thriller conventions, but tweaking them with unexpected revelations, this thriller might have lost all credibility. But Blakeson never pushes too far, maintains the suspense, and the casts brings home the show with much gusto. I really had a good time with this film and it is a definite recommendation. BUT DON'T READ THE SPOILERS! KGHarris, 12/10.",1291766400,2010-12-08

5.0,"Arrow is a surprisingly great show and apparently a real winner for the struggling CW. Yes, it's another hero show, but this one has a secret weapon I did not see coming - the hero is played by a relative newcomer (having had parts in Private Practice, Heartland, Hung and Vampire Diaries) Stephen Amell. Beautifully playing Oliver Queen, son of a very rich but underhanded father who dies in his arms after their yacht sank in a terrible storm leaving him the only one alive on a mysterious island somewhere off the grid. The fact that he is also easy on the eyes (translated also a beautiful guy!) makes this show fun for us girls, too!Before his father died, he made Oliver promise to right all of the wrongs he made when evidently greed trumped compassion in the building of the Queen empire. While Oliver lands on the island a spoiled rotten rich kid who has led a life of decadent consumption, the mysteries begin unraveling quickly for him. He must survive on his own, learning to do things he never dreamed he would have to do. Enter a mysterious Chinese man who, up to the most recent episode, pops into his life, saving him from a very dark encounter with a very dangerous group of men we still haven't been told of their origin.We can only assume, up until now, that everything that happened to Oliver on that island for five years, taught him how to appear and disappear, shoot an arrow so deftly, it defies reality, and has honed his body into a sort of killing machine.He comes home, much to the delight of his mother and sister who had thought him dead, and quickly but secretly sets up shop in an abandoned Queen-owned warehouse and sets about fulfilling the promise he made to his father on the life raft before he died. Now the story is set up for him to assume the role of a vigilante he becomes known as Arrow.Arrow is a fun show, more intelligent than many like it, with great characters we like to love, the ever intriguing secret identity, the loyal sidekick, John, the beginnings of the requisite unrequited love story, and great weekly stories we can look forward to.Most of us have too much to do and not enough time to do it all in, so we have to be picky about which shows to invest time in. I say WATCH THIS ONE! Fun enough to keep you interested, intelligent enough to not feel too guilty about and a handsome cast - something for everybody. Also, popular enough that CW has already picked up a full season with good reason to believe more years to come. A definite winner all the way around. ARROW - CATCH UP HERE ON AMAZON, then look forward to new shows on CW each week. Enjoy!",1353628800,2012-11-23

5.0,"Woke this morning to NPR's (National Public Radio) on THE MISSING PICTURE, this movie by Rithy Panh. It wasn't the reporter's words, but the soundtrack of this movie which grabbed me. I've never heard/heard of before. Native music on  instruments I'd never heard was scored with screams and sounds of mayhem, agony, anguish and razing of Cambodia itselfand its people by the Khmer Rouge. The soundtrack was a montage of wailing pleas,  threats of KR shoulders, screams, shots, explosions, crashing trees and burning huts. All mixed together beautifully, horribly. People of all ages from infants to children to teens, a culture being viciously destroyed.In the early 1980's in Kampuchea, Cambodia renamed, I talked with teens, grown up Cambodians, of the few survivors. Eagerto talk to an American (as Asians were, hearing english. testing the few words they knew, they opened up.Vivid descriptions of tortures, massacres, burning villages and vicious rabid KR troops.Truth can be good. These truths, very bad. Horrific. I spent only four days walking with a few Cambodians, struggling to describe, point out mass graves, remains of villages, bones of people. A few more days visiting temples and cities, rebuilt villages and homes of Kampuchea. Why change their homeland's name? Some said to let their people forget. Others said to not frighten tourists away.Earlier times in Thailand, in the 80's, Thailand's King was said tohave pronounced an edict: Mess with a tourist and you won't live to get to the police station. I repeatedly heard a story of a Thai man who killed a tourist. He got to the police station alive; buthad been shot, put into a cell and left to die. 'Rich falangs', a Thai world for non-thai's; can't remember the Kampuchean word for Americans and Europeans... Round Eyes? Heard that name elsewhere in Asia another time.I'm pre-ordering THE MISSING PICTURE. Meantime I'm going to re-see THE KILLING FIELDS, an award-winning film of years ago. Tremendous movie of reporters caught in that war zone then. War zone? Genocide would be more like it.I bought The KILLING FIELDS DVD about 13 years ago, for $15.95 at Amazon.

3.0,"I should not have paid as much as I did to watch this pre-theatrical release.  I did so because I thought a documentary based upon the book ""Freakonomics"" would be very interesting.  There were a number of interesting points in the film, but this is just one more case where the reviewer says that the book was much better.  The main problem I had with the film is that it presented so little information in the time allotted.  I believe this was because it attempted to be entertaining as well as the directors personalizing the content and wasting time by injecting too much of themselves into the content.  This lead to a boring documentary where I felt cheated of time and money because so little real content was presented.  I suggest reading the book and skipping the movie.  If you would rather watch a film than to read a book, then wait til after the film is released in theaters and distributed on DVD.  I do not think this film will be able to command a high price for very long after it is distributed on DVD and you should be able to rent or buy it at a discounted price.  This book is essentially about looking at common phenomina from different or non-standard points of view.  In doing so, there really is no timely earthshaking material so you will not have missed much by waiting for lower prices.  I still believe the book or the film contain perspectives that make them worthwhile, but the film barely earns an average rating in my opinion which is generous in this instance.",1285113600,2010-09-22

5.0,"Very few television series can boast that they have been blessed with the greatest production values ever, as well has having a remarkable cast and crew that knew they were making something for generations of people to enjoy. ""Rome"" is one such series. A huge ratings winner when it was first broadcast on HBO, the series is set in Ancient Rome and deals with the death of Mark Antony, as well as Ancient Rome's transition from Republic to Empire, and Caesar's Invasion of Gaul. The backdrop of the story deals with the beautiful heterosexual relationship of two soldiers, Lucius and Titus, who find their lives intertwined and who basically fight for each other, at times often to the point of risking their own lives. What I have always admired ""Rome"" for is its depiction of how close it came in presenting itself as a series that actually looks like a theatrical release. The budget was probably the highest for any series and it shows on the screen. From the sets to the costumes, the producers were not shy in their attempt in bringing viewers back to a time in European history that many did not know much about, except for those who excelled in history while in grade school or college. This set comes with 12 episodes housed in a splendid DVD case made out of thick, strong cardboard that protects the dics. The set also comes with a slew of bonuses including audio commentary, interviews with the cast and crew, and so much more. Add this set to your DVD archive as you will view it over and over. A second season is also available, either in a stand alone set or the ""Complete Rome DVD Set"".

The way the guy is made up when he gets upset looks pretty damn good for being a ""beast"".  I have not missed an episode since it started.  The girl plays a beautiful cop with a bit of ""beast"" in her sort of like Chuck Norris. The friendship develops very strong and is a perfect addition to make the entire show.",1353369600,2012-11-20

2.0,"Swamp People was an ok show. I chose to watch this show after seeing it pop up as a recommendation here on Amazon. I love the show Mountain Men and I love the show Duck Dynasty and Swamp people seems to try to capture some of the same feelings from these shows. You have the &#34;redneck&#34; feel from Duck Dynasty and the &#34;tough guy&#34; feeling from Mountain Men. While it was definitely interesting to get a peek into the unique lives of the people on this show, I didnt feel like any of the characters really had that appeal or charm that a reality show needs to keep viewers interested. Plus, there are really only so many times one can watch people catch crocodiles in a swamp. &#34;Meh&#34; is my overall opinion of this show. I wouldn't recommend it or choose it again.",1400716800,2014-05-22

It comes so close to reality it's scary. it shows the cops as the fallible, dedicated, flawed and sometimes heroic people they are.

2.0,"I'm such a huge fan of Halley Berry and SciFi movies and TV programs in general, BUT.  I watched this pilot and like the overall idea, but as the saying goes, '...first impressions mean everything.'  Things I don't like about this already:  1.)  Her husband is a scientist who doesn't believe humans have souls - he insults those who believe so and likens the soul to a 'lifetime of memories' only.  I am uncomfortable with this premise on any level.  2.)  One scene shows the son and husband being shuttled to a science conference by a self propelled/piloted transport vehicle on auto pilot.  I also have issue with this as well as I hope we never succumb to this idea of vehicles as mere appliances to get us from point A to B instead of as a right of passage during our youth and a means of independence and joy.  I enjoy my ICE vehicles and would not trade them in for any EV - EVER!  Since I'm an open minded person, I will continue to give this new series a chance and hopefully the cool and imaginative plot lines will overshadow the writer's agnostic undertones.",1405382400,2014-07-15
5.0,"Haven is an excellent Sci-Fi, mystery television series that airs on SyFy. Earlier seasons can be viewed through various online outlets.Audrey Parker, a paranormal curious FBI agent, is sent to the town of Haven to investigate a strange case. Here she experiences some unusual events and a possible link to her mom. After successfully closing her case in Haven, the police Chief invites Parker to stay on with a promise of aiding in her search for her mother.Local police officer, Nathan, pairs up with Parker to solve various other crimes with weird circumstances. Parker finds more clues and Haven citizens connected to her past.What I really enjoy about Haven is the mature story line and characters. A lot of the available paranormal shows are geared for a younger, teenage type audience. This one is not. And the writing is not drowned in romantic anxiety or all the other cliche material found elsewhere. It is original content. I find it very entertaining and it satisfies my adult side.",1396828800,2014-04-07

I have always been a fan of what used to be known as &#34;B&#34; movies both sci fi and horror and that's what I would consider this to be. Good action but rather weak character development which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I wasn't expecting Shakespeare and it was a decent enough popcorn movie.

4.0,"Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning follows John after his wife and daughter are murdered by Luc Deveraux. John begins to search for Luc; as he gets closer, he begins to question his memory and his identity. Universal Soldier: DoR is a brutal, action-packed film, although a bit confusing.The story in this film is interesting; the storytelling, however, was confusing and inconsistent- not to the point of hatred, but to the point of having to ask questions you shouldn't have to. You'll eventually grasp the concept, but the film mostly leaves the audience hanging, especially those that are not familiar with the series. However, if you're looking for an action film, this is a vicious example of what action should be. The action in the film is intense and extremely violent- how much weight this holds, negative or positive, is completely up to you. A lot of the variety in the action, as well; I'm talking intense fist fights, an exceptional bat fight, a bloody knife/machete fight, ultra-violent shootouts, and a destructive car chase- top this off with several epic showdowns, and you have a balanced action flick. The choreography was great, and Scott Adkins does an exceptional job. Despite almost a 2 hour runtime, Dolph Lundgren has little screen time, and Van Damne has even less; Scott Adkins steals the show, and I'm okay with that.Other than the often confusing story, I also disliked the occasional flashing sequences. Not just in this film, I've never liked scenes with insanely rapid flashing- it's distracting and hazardous to some viewers. I believe this occurs two or three times for about a minute or two, sometimes a flickering aftereffect accompanies these scenes.Overall, Universal Solider: DoR has superb and varied action sequences, although the confusing storytelling and some editing choices, like the flashing, hurt the film, in my opinion. As of 4/23/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, I recommend a purchase for action fans, and a rental otherwise.This film has very strong violence and gore, full male/female nudity and sex.",1366675200,2013-04-23

I bellieve the stories are writen to capture our imagination in a way that this is an believable event.  The characters are realistic and the very subtle, gradual change in some personalities is a lifelike emersion.  For some the life is black and white and for others there is lots of grey.  If one was to analyze the characters, I'm sure he/she could apply the personalities to people they know or know of.

5.0,"In 2010, the Syfy channel had an interesting idea, to take one of Stephen King's lesser known works, a rare dramatic mystery, The Colorado Kid, and turn it into a Science Fiction story. A lot of Syfy's original shows are way out there, but Haven is more grounded and has quickly amassed a cult following. While there are similarities to the book and other King works are referenced, the show is surprisingly original.Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is an FBI agent, who gets a tip that one of her fugitives has been spotted in the small town of Haven Maine. Parker is a terrific agent, because she knows nothing of who she is or where she came from. This beautiful, but introverted girl has put everything into her work and it has become her whole life. Once she gets to Haven, she realizes that something about this town isn't quite right, but she has no idea what she's in store for.During her investigation, Parker meets two brothers who have run the towns newspaper for 40 years. These brother show Parker some old stories from a unsolved case 25 years earlier, the murder of the Colorado Kid. Why would Audry care about it you ask, well there is a photo in the paper, showing a woman at the crime scene who could pass for her twin.With the chance to discover who she is and where she came from Parker takes a leave of absence from the FBI and joins the Haven P.D. only to discover that the town and it's people are afflicted with something known as the troubles. These troubled people, for some unknown reason, have ailments that allow them to do the seemingly impossible, such as shape-shifting, destruction with a thought, murder by shadow, the ability to star fires, even an artist who control things simply by drawing them.Parker is paired with the towns only Detective, Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryant) who himself is a troubled person. His affliction is that he can't feel anything, an adaptation of a real disease in which people can't feel pain, Wuornos can't feel a thing. Together Parker and Wuornos investigate these troubles, trying to find out what's causing them, while at the same time, Audry tries to solve the Colorado Kid case in the hopes that she might one day find out who she is and where she comes from.This show is fantastic and it's not just about the Science Fiction mystery that I love so much. The troubles are a big part of it, but there is also a great mystery to the whole thing, that is really left to the audience to figure out along with Audrey. The show is further boosted by the small town element, as Haven is one of these quaint towns, where everyone knows everyone else. It makes for some fabulous recurring guests, side stories, and the occasional hilarious moment.Emily Rose is out of this world! She has always had bit parts in TV series here and there, but she's never been a star before, but when it comes to Haven she is truly the perfect one to play Audrey Parker. She brings such a different personality to a sci-fi/cop show and the way the mystery and troubles follow her really draws the audience in.Lucas Bryant is just as interesting as we try to figure out what draws this man into this work. Sure he's trouble, but his lack of feeling has left him emotionless. At times it seems like he's doing a job he doesn't want to do, but for some reason has to.The only other regular cast member is Eric Balfour who at the ripe age of 37 is a Science Fiction veteran. Balfour has done a ton of Sci-Fi, but finds himself in a different role in Haven. Balfour plays Duke Crocker, a petty criminal and smuggler, with a terrific sense of humor, who always seems to get caught up in these troubles cases.Haven is amazing, it's just one of these addictive shows that draws you in right from the very first episode. The writing makes you feel like you're riding along in your hometown, trying to figure out the mystery along side the two detectives. Every episode is better than the one before it and it's just one of those shows you never want to stop watching. It is one of the best shows I have seen in ages and I really can't recommend it enough!",1388361600,2013-12-30
5.0,"The subject matter is appalling in itself.  It is difficult to detach yourself emotionally from the horrors that were inflicted at Auschwitz.But, it is a BBC production and with that comes thorough, authoritative, accurate and objective presentation of the subject matter.It is worth watching as an historical document and not for entertainment, which it certainly is not!  I believe everyone should see this from the standpoint of understanding what a despotic and/or dictatorial regime can accomplish if left unchecked.  When one person can rule an entire nation by personal decree as opposed to a balanced law making process, then anything and everything is possible, even to declaring a portion of your own population to be a dangerous enemy.

5.0,"People who wax philisophical about this being the Golden Age of television arent off in any way.  Never before in my life have I been around so many solidly great shows airing at once.  I'm not saying this is universal, because of course this is also the era of reality TV, but between The Wire, Dexter, Numb3rs, Lost, Californication, etc, etc, I've never before been as excited about what is possible with television as an entertainment media.  I think we have far and away trumped movies as far as overall content and originality.  Movies are all about the ""remake"" these days, but shows like Breaking Bad are about as original as you could possibly ask for.I wont really get into too much thematic elements or subject items, because I dont want to spoil one second of this extremely brief Season 1, but Bryan Cranston absolutely hits it out of the park with his portrayal of ""average middle class dad"".  He plays it so numb, then breaks bad with such force...I honestly think this is one of the performances of the year.  I'm not overstating this in any way, he's phenomenal.  He makes you so sympathetic to his plight that you really watch each episode absolutely rooting for him to best the challenging sitution he's involved in.  He's the baddest nerd that ever was.Give this show one episode, and you'll be hooked, and go ahead and set aside another six hours to marathon the rest of the series.  Its that good.",1251158400,2009-08-25

Like a lot of other reviewers stated, the episode seemed much longer than 30 minutes. I was completely bored the entire time. I'm not the prudish type, but I found the gratuitous nudity and sex scenes off-putting. They added absolutely nothing and weren't even mildly entertaining.

4.0,"Writer/director Matthew Leutwyler manages to challenge the concentration and intellect and attention span of the viewer in this non-linear and ultimately satisfying intertwining of stories that examine the bad in the best of us and the good in the worst of us. Against the backdrop of a child abduction case (person of interest is next door neighbor Beckworth (Greg Germann) we follow five days in the life of Frankie, a single parent detective (Julie Benz) assigned to the case, her best friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose determination to get pregnant keeps her from confronting Ryan (Dane Cook) her psychologist husband's infidelity with rock singer Tara (Aja Volkman) while he is attempting to reconcile his parents (his fragile mother played by Barbara Hershey) long separation, an on-line video game addicted  school teacher Carter (Mark Kelly) and his obsession with the missing child that pushes him to the edge of vigilantism, a beat cop Jerry (Erik Palladino) grieving over the violent death of his wife, Drew (Miranda Bailey) recovering addict and her wheel chair bound brother Erik (Vincent Vinteresca)preparing for the LA marathon, and Allegra (Kali Hawk), a self-loathing African American TV writer's search for love who happens to be a patient of Ryan's (and who is on the brink of a mixed courtships with a shy and likely virginal Evan played by Zack Gifford). The string of stories asks us to look at their lives (and ours!) and to take action where it is needed to end injustice.The cast of characters is so strong that despite the rather confusing progress o the story we get to know each character very well.  The ending is exceptionally well handled.  This is one o those surprise films that appears on the surface to be one of those shallow/too much too fast director's egomaniacal art films, but by film's end the audience simply cannot fail to be touched in many different positive ways. Grady Harp, August 12",1344643200,2012-08-11
5.0,"By this point, NCIS has become a comfortable old shoe.  We KNOW there's going to be a ""Body Of The Week"", but the story surrounding is what keeps us watching.  It's just the love for the characters.  It's sort of funny, because I don't remember being as invested in the characters this series spun off from--""JAG""--as I am in Jethro, Tony, Ziva, Tim, Abby, Leon, Ducky and Jimmy; and the characters that come in and out of the MTAC.  The cast knows how nuch the viewers are invested in the series--therefore Mark, Michael, Cote, Sean, the great Pauley, Rocky, David and Brian don't phone in episodes.Season 9 continues with the mystery thought completed with the death of the ""Port-to-Port Killer"" at the end of Season 8, specifically the capsule E.J. Barrett removed from the body of her murdered NCIS agent.  That capsule--and the information contained within--sort of sets in place NCIS' usual balance of the season, in which they finish one part of the storyline in the first part of the season and set up the second half leading to the cliffhanger at the end of the season.  What makes this storyline unique in the NCIS history is that it's the first story/season in which the larger enemies of the season are domestic.  To the viewer, the idea of the MTAC having to work against ""Enemies Domestic"" becomes very uncomfortable at points.  Starting off with the ""Phantom Eight"" half of the season and finishing with the Harper Deering storyline, this is a season which throws Gibbs' team a little off-center, and leads to a few not-so-pleasant discoveries.I've gotten to the point where I don't watch the series so much for the regulars, I watch for the return visits.  Obviously, Joe Spano's visits as Jethro's friend/rival, the FBI agent Tobias Fornell, are always a kick--but this year's visit comes with the added issue of meeting the woman both Jethro and Tobias were married to, Diane--who's played with a thoroughly enjoyable emnity to both her ex-husbands by Melinda McGraw.  Robert Wagner's visits as Anthony DiNozzo The Elder are sheer delight.  Diane Neal's turns as the Coast Guard agent Abagail Borin--the female Gibbs--are always fun.  Wendy Makkena's turns as Dr. Rachel Cranston--the sister of the late Kate Todd are eerie, since Makkena looks so much like Sasha Alexander...there's also a sad and bittersweet return by Enrique Murciano as Ziva's CIA boyfriend, Ray Cruz.The series hit 200 episodes this season, with ""Hereafter"" being a Gibbsian version of ""It's A Wonderful Life""--shot in a diner, Jethro gets a visit from Mike Franks as his spirit guide.  For those of us who were upset about losing Muse Watson...""Hereafter"" is a treat, bringing both characters still alive in the NCIS storyline and characters lost/killed--Chris Pacci from Season 1, Ari Haswari, Jenny Sheppard--through ghostly visits; highlighted by conversations Gibbs has with his mother...and of course, Shannon and Kelly.New this season in the NCIS legend was Scott Wolf--and his baby face--as the dangerous Phantom Eight operative Casey Stratton; and Jamie Lee Curtis as DOD PsyOps Specialist Samantha Ryan--a love interest for Jethro.  Jamie Lee and Mark Harmon have a good screen chemistry, which dates back to the Disney redo of ""Freaky Friday"" a few years back.  Jamie Lee has aged well--her pageboy haircut does her justice, and she's got GREAT shoulders.The season winds into the Harper Deering storyline, in which Richard Schiff gives a memorable turn as a rich father having lost a son to the Navy...and wants to get even.  Credit to Schiff, who really didn't go into scene chewing through his performance.The season-ending cliffhanger--Deering bombing the Navy Yard, complicated by Ducky having a heart attack at Palmer's wedding--seemed a little over-the-top for the series; but again--the season just seemed strange because of the issue that the enemy of the season...seemed very plain in his way.  Oddly, that didn't detract from the overall of the season, though.Highly recommended.",1384819200,2013-11-19

4.0,"I was watching a documentary on horror films in the U.S. the other day and while I watched I realized something. There were actually few if any true horror films are being made these days. Granted there are films made that qualify for the genre, but most are more obsessed these days with how far they can push the envelope, how much gore they can include and how disgusting they can make the world seem. Far too many have chosen to go the Rob Zombie route of showing us homes in decay where dirt is far more common than cleanliness. I for one would find it more terrifying to see a serial killer in a well kept home than the unwashed, unbathed louts living in trailer parks more frequently seen today. Then I watched THE INNKEEPERS.The Yankee Pedlar Inn was founded in 1891 and has seen better days. The last weekend the hotel is to be open two clerks are working taking care of just three customers. Claire (Sara Paxton) is an early twenty something working at the inn with no outlook on her future. Luke (Pat Healy) is a laid back older guy who lives at home with his mother and has no future prospects as well. The pair has formed a friendship while working at the Inn and share an interest in the history of the locale as well. Said to be haunted, Luke has set up a web site based in incidents that he has recorded while working there.On this, the last weekend, the pair hopes to finally catch something worthwhile to include on the site, a real paranormal happening that can be verified with two people on hand. Checking into the hotel we find a young mother and her son, staying to avoid her possibly soon to be ex-husband. Later we have a movie star who's seen better days, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), here to speak at a convention nearby. Lastly we have an elderly man (George Riddle) checking in to recall the good old days when he came here on his wedding night. But the guests are secondary for the most part though they play important roles as the film winds down. It is the spirits and the search for them that make up the scares here.Claire and Luke take turns watching the desk and taking care of the needs of their customers. When not working, they sleep or attempt to record EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), recordings of spiritual voices in the room unable to be heard by the human ear. During the times when Claire searches for signs of the afterlife more happens than with Luke. It seems as if the spirits are trying to reach Claire for some reason.Star struck by Leanne, Claire displays the usual fan klutz attitude. But later the two have the opportunity to talk. It turns out Leanne isn't in town to speak at an acting class or fan fair but to speak about her newest calling, healing via crystals and the like. Assuming the role of medium, she tries to help Claire with the search for the main spirit in the hotel, one Madeline O'Malley. Murdered and her body hidden in the cellar for 3 days by the owners of the hotel at that time to avoid bad publicity, it is said that Madeline continues to walk the halls of the hotel. In attempting to contact her, Leanne offers sound advice to Claire: don't go in the basement. Any guess as to where Claire goes?Between bumps in the night, a piano that plays itself and several other scares the film does indeed offer some truly frightening moments as it plays out. The first third of the film offers little in the way of horror with the exception of a few jump moments, scenes where things make loud noises causing the viewer to jump. But as it progresses it tells a tale that evokes some haunting images and a story that slowly unfolds to bring about real scares.The acting is wonderful here, especially from the two leads. They don't appear to be actors at all but two people who work at the most boring of jobs, leading boring lives in search of something else outside of their own level of comfort. When the world they seek appears to be coming alive, their terror seems real as well.The movie is slow paced but wonderfully so, never rushing to get us somewhere but letting us take in the whole view of the hotel and its history given in bits and pieces. The need for gore is absent and that makes the scares even more disturbing. Horror films that allow you brain to fill in the gaps make for much scarier viewing than simple effects. This film offers the thrill of the old horror film and that's something it should be proud of. If you want to see how a horror film can be done right, then by all means check this one out.",1336953600,2012-05-14

1.0,"This is a thinly scripted fake reality program about gold mining. The two lead characters are supposed failed real estate hustlers who are deep in debt and who are going to save themselves financially by mining gold in Africa. The show's speciality is fake peril. Lots of overly dramatic moments involving crime, dealing with criminals, fights and so on. With almost a two-person cast at a few locations, the show profits are probably good but they are constantly having to be very inventive to fill airtime. They manage to keep the program going (often in spite of itself) through sheer energy.The show isn't big on continuity. No mention of last seasons investor and get equipment magically back without paying bills owed. And once again, though mining in the bush, everyone is very, very clean. I hope they manage to do some competent mining at some point in this season. But I kind of doubt it.Those involved in the show deserve a degree of technical credit for being able to produce a watchable hourlong show like this with a primary cast of two. Everyone is very earnest even when talking nonsense. It not a good show, but everyone involved seems to be at least trying.",1377475200,2013-08-26
4.0,"John Morse was such a figure in the annuals of Masterpiece Theatre, particularly the Mystery Division. Since his death, DS Lewis his partner has gone through one crisis after another. His wife was killed, his partner died, but on the bright side he was promoted to DI. He is still with the Thames Valley Police Department, and  their turf is still Oxford. His new partner is a junior partner, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox,  who is the epitome of DI Morse! They have the same sort of class rivalry, but it is upended.In this series, they deal with altered identities and crimes of retribution. DI Lewis is still having difficulty dealing with his wife's unsolved murder, so this is s 'come to momma' series. DS Lewis is much darker and his life is more complicated than the more frivolous Lewis we knew of yore. The murders in this series are incredibly complex, the stories much more updated and modern. DS Hathaway is from public school and Cambridge, so he seems to fit right in with the characters in these episodes. He smokes, was an athlete and once studied for the priesthood. He is tightly controlled , and he does not reveal much if anything of his background.DI Lewis and DS Hathaway are the epitome of opposites attract, and they make the best pair of detectives. Masterpiece is known as giving us the best in performances, and once again, they deliver!Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-03-13",1362268800,2013-03-03

1.0,"How to tell when a movie is below budget cheap.(1.) No subtitles for either English or people with hearing problems.(2.) Intro that makes no intelligent sense to anyone with a high school or above educational background. NASA finds alien life forms in our solar system which have been identified as ""the writer's of  this movie"". NASA decides to bring said alien life back to Earth who start out looking remarkably like common wood decay fungi (e.g. Trametes versicolor) but then acquire the anatomy of an ocean dwelling cross between a jellyfish and a squid. Unfortunately for our alien writers who never passed 10th grade biology or 9th grade physical science the physics of this anatomy is mechanically unsustainable walking about on the surface of Earth.(3.) Handheld cinematography that looks like something your Neanderthal relatives took while touring deteriorating industrial, trash and natural disaster wreckage in Central America. Really really bad/cheap CGI on our poor stranded jellysquid. The jellysquid's agent should be fired or eaten.(4.) Actors with the emotional impact of the above mentioned fungi and the dialogue capacity of seven monosyllabic words per edited scene.(5.) Props in the movie consisted mostly of road signs that said ""Infection Area""; fungi on trees; army surplus gas masks; a crane to lift a truck then drop it which is edited to make it seem like the aforementioned jellysquid did it.(6.) Whale sound effects that unfortunately for our alien writers, had they spent $10 to hire a marine biologist they would have found out, that for the most part are of a frequency pattern that works primarily under water. Which brings up the question of what planet in our solar system did these creatures come from?(7.) It takes 45 minutes into this handheld travelogue before anything interesting happens and another 45 minutes to hope it ends quicker.",1296777600,2011-02-04

I expected something on par with a SyFy original movie, but I was wrong- the quality of this movie is much, much higher. It can be a tad cheesy and melodramatic at times, but for the most part, this is a great medieval fantasy movie with solid acting, effects, and plot. I particularly enjoyed the emphasis on supernatural elements, and Kane's battle to redeem his wicked soul. The plot is also developed surprisingly well, with a few elements that I did not see coming. Solid and fun!",1381795200,2013-10-15

It's not a blockbuster, an epic saga, or super troopers--it's real, it's charming, it's funny, it's slow and it's characters are lovely to watch.  This movie feels like the ending of a good, long book where all the loose ends are leisurely tied up.  The sound during dialogue had some odd parts, but that aside, it was a nicely done movie.

2.0,"Disappointing body horror flick (think early David Cronenberg but without the pulpy thrills) about a young lesbian who is roofied at a party and has unprotected sex with a man in his car.  The next day she starts feeling sick and is eventually convinced that she has a sexually transmitted disease.Contracted has a lot of promise that it never fulfills, both because of lack of imagination and unnecessary implausibilities that make the movie feel a whole lot dumber than it apparently thinks it is.When the main character goes to her doctor with alarming symptoms that include extensive vaginal bleeding and a slowed heart rate he tells her she has a head cold.  When she goes back a day later with even more alarming symptoms including teeth and hair falling out and bloody red eyes he tells her to avoid contact with other people until the results of her blood test comes back when a more reasonable response would be to admit her to a hospital and possibly contact the CDC.The police are looking for anyone who came into contact with that man at the party, which suggests they might know something about what is happening to the heroine, but she refuses to go to the police and her friend who gave the party, knows her friend had sex with the guy, knows her friend is super sick and is visited by the police multiple times also neglects to inform them.  Instead she tells the girl's lesbian lover, which might make sense to the people who made this movie but, under the circumstances, seemed pretty bizarre to me.It also would have been cool if the lead character was spreading a plague without realizing it (like Marilyn Chambers in Rabid) and she works in a restaurant, preparing salads, touching glasses and dishes and silverware--which would be the perfect way to accidentally spread a deadly disease--but the movie does absolutely nothing with this obvious narrative opportunity, which seems like a huge waste.Contracted follows the least interesting path that it possibly can given its set-up and ends up being a well-acted but dull horror film with a few gross images but not much else.",1395792000,2014-03-26

5.0,"I was a fan of the show as a young girl, and had resisted seeing the new edition of Dr. Who for some time.  Now, 8 years after its birth to our new television viewing audience, I can see what all the fuss is about.  It took me a day and a half to watch the first season, and if how quickly I viewed those episodes is ANY indicator of my opinion on the show - well, lets just say I am HOOKED!  I was sad to see Eccleston (The 9th Dr.) go so quickly after only one season, but Tennant as the regenerated 10th Doctor was a surprise I was not expecting.  The writing by Russell T. Davies is exceptional!  This storyteller weaves a tale that is a tasty mix of old Sci-Fi, fun new worlds and new characters, and a touching love for humanity and hope.  Tennant's range of emotion in a character who could have been hardened by time, has a love for the Planet earth that can never be explained.  Everything is new, and the things in the world that could be perceived as odd or frightening or dangerous, he sees with the eyes of a scientist saying things like &#34;You're MAGNIFICENT! and Just look at YOU - you're BEAUTIFUL!&#34;  Additionally, like every lonely traveller, the Dr. needs a companion who he finds in the more common part of London.  The lovely Rose Tyler proves to be more than a pretty face.  Born with a spirit for adventure, this couple makes traveling the universe fun and exciting.  And of course....what unsuspecting young girl wouldn't fall in love with such a lonely yet exciting man of the universe.Though some of the special effects are a bit cheesy, that seems to have always been the basis of the 'fun' in the show since the '60's.  I can't say enough about how much I have enjoyed watching the second, third and fourth seasons of Dr. Who.  The departure of Russell T. Davies as lead writer and David Tennant as the Dr. were indeed a sad loss for the show.Rating - DEFINITELY SEE THIS SEASON....",1363219200,2013-03-14
5.0,"Good writing and decent acting can carry almost any TV series.  The (character) acting in this one is actually quite good, so I give it top marks.  Each season has a coherent story arc that transitions smoothly from the last.Having relatives in Harlan County, though, I can say that some of the accents are closer than others.  But who cares?",1389657600,2014-01-14
5.0,"shows on TV right now.  I've been loving Supernatural since the first episode and Sam/Dean have really grown in the series.  From fledgling demon hunters to full on demon killers, but still at the same time keeping that thing that seperates us from them...their humanity.  Yes, he sold his soul to save his brother and that is one of the major storylines in Season 3.  As the brothers race towards finding a way to undo this pact that has been made.Not knowing what lies ahead for them it never stops the Winchester brothers from having a blast doing what their Dad trained them to do.  It's violent, dark and grown up, but at the same time its light hearted and funny to watch.  Supernatural isn't like any show out there and that's what makes me love it so much.  Especially after the Season 3 epic cliffhanger, I can't spoil for folks that haven't seen it yet.But wow!  It's something else and will leave you wanting Season 4 to hurry and come out on DVD asap.  I love all the characters in story whether recurring (Bobby) or not.  They all make this show something special and kudos to the writers, producers, directors, set designers, lighting effects, custome designers and everyone else work on the show.  Thanks for making Supernatural just that.",1242604800,2009-05-18

4.0,"This is a truly fascinating documentary, and it's subjects can be equally appalling and appealing. My reactions to the White family ran the gamut from pity, compassion, disgust and anger, and often ended back on compassion for these dirt-poor, fairly uneducated people. After watching this film, I don't think the White family is actually scamming the system much when it comes to the social-security checks, because I think they ARE all certifiably crazy!!! However, they should certainly be prosecuted for their drug offenses, assaults and murders just like everyone else. Although I did feel compassion for Kirk when she lost her baby to Child Protective Services, I was relieved that the state took her baby, because CLEARLY she is quite an unfit mother. I feel terribly sorry for her little boy who has to stay with her. (I have wondered if the state of West Virginia would end up taking her son away from her after watching her behavior on this film). I felt so bad for the Matriarch of the White Clan, Bertie, because she is so obviously a good Christian woman for the most part. It's obvious that there is a lot of love for each other in this family, but they have all turned into a band of criminals. It's a shame that Jesco hasnt been able to make an honest living from his dancing, which I found fascinating to watch!",1375920000,2013-08-08

5.0,"In fairness, ""Dallas"" is probably a four-star show at best, but I am giving it five stars for overall entertainment value. This is a great show, especially if you were a fan of the original series. Season 2 picks up right where last season left off, and every episode is full of drama, mystery, and suspense. I was very nervous about how the show would deal with the death of Larry Hagman: how in the world can you have ""Dallas"" without J.R. Ewing? But I was extremely impressed and satisfied with the way his death was handled on the show, and I think ""Dallas"" is good enough to stand on its own without J.R. for quite some time. (Except, enough with the annoying Ramos clan. They've all got to go. And please, let them take Emma with them.) Overall, it was a great season. I can't wait for Season 3!",1366070400,2013-04-16
3.0,"I gave this a three because it's just nice to see something other than Vampires and Zombies on TV, BUT: I wanted to like this show but I found some of the premises of the show unbelievable, and then there was the acting and/or directing.SPOILERS:1. ISSUES WITH THE PREMISE: The basic plot premise is that Elena is the ONLY WOMAN EVER to have survived being bitten. We were told that women weren't strong enough to survive the change. Well, okay, I didn't like that -- women survive childbirth which involves spreading open and moving internal body parts to expel a baby, and we survive that, but we can't survive the first change. Disappointing, but that's the author's premise. Then there's Elena--she survives the change. And does first villain want to capture her to study her DNA, her blood values, her brain chemistry or any number of other scientific things to figure out how she survived?  NO. He just wants to keep her bare pawed  and pregnant with new little superwolf babies.  Didn't make sense to me.2. ISSUES WITH THE HEROINE: Elena doesn't want to kill - yeah well that's such a clich&eacute;. The entire first season I wanted to shake her and yell GET OVER IT!  Could we not have found a more original conflict issue?  Elena acts the stereotypical female, &#34;I'm so emotional, I can't handle it, I'm going to run away and have normal life no matter what it costs.&#34; GET OVER IT!Her refusal to accept her new reality costs the lives of her pack members and the guy she's supposed to love but that's OK 'cause she's a girl and girls are just like that. &#60;You have no idea how many times I was screaming YOU DWEEBETTE&#62; at the screen. so I found the heroine as portrayed in the TV series to be annoying.3. ISSUES WITH THE FIRST VILLAIN: The rich coward who uses others to do his dirty work. Of course, our current meme is that anyone who is rich has to be a coward who uses others to do his dirty work.  And I admit at times I hallucinated a mustache on the villain and saw him twirl it and go, BWA-ha-ha.4. ISSUES WITH THE CAST/DIRECTION: Never mind that the woman chosen to play Elena is a stereotype in herself. (All that blonde hair and big sad blue eyes), I'm used to casting directors choosing actors who look like Barbie models. But so many of the actors in this series gave me the feeling that they were just phoning it in. Now I have to believe that there are some fine actors in the cast, so I wonder at why everyone's performance seemed just a step or two down from what it should have been. Did they not believe in their part? Is the director doing it deliberately? Was the cast chosen to be understated and they are too understated? I don't know, but I had the feeling that sometimes they just wanted to be home on their real couch drinking a beer.4.  STORYLINE DRAWN OUT TOO LONG:  I skipped some of the middle episodes because I was so bored waiting for the big battle.Look I can't speak to the novels, I haven't read them. And I've noted that those who have are not particularly happy with the changes themselves. And whoever decided that women couldn't shape shift really took a lot of the fun out of it for me. I give it a three for &#34;nice try&#34; but  the new season of SCANDAL just came out. I think I'll go watch that.",1400371200,2014-05-18

5.0,"It has taken four years but Solomon Kane has finally made its way to the U.S. and the wait was worth it, as this is the best film adaptation yet of a Robert E. Howard character.  Granted, that&#8217;s not saying a whole lot given previous history.  The original 1982 Conan film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was an enjoyable but highly flawed film; it&#8217;s 1984 sequel, the 2011 reboot, and the Kull the Conqueror films do not even bear discussion in the equation.Solomon Kane may have been Howard&#8217;s greatest character.  He was certainly the late pulp writer&#8217;s most complex creation.  The Puritan adventurer was more the antithesis of Conan&#8230;a man who avoided violence but was driven by a code of strict moral ethics as opposed to Conan&#8217;s more earthly pursuits of gold, women, and ale.  Michael J. Bassett&#8217;s screenplay is not based on any of Howard&#8217;s original stories although bits and pieces are cobbled from several such as &#8220;The Moon of Skulls&#8221;, and &#8220;Blades of the Brotherhood&#8221;.While Howard never wrote Kane an origin story per se, Bassett provides his vision of Kane&#8217;s backstory.  We first meet Kane (Purefoy) in North Africa (where Howard based many of the original Kane tales) as a ruthless pirate leading his men against an Ottoman fortress.  While searching the castle for plunder, Kane encounters a hooded demon known as the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Reaper&#8221; who tells Kane his soul is doomed to Hell for his past evils.  Kane escapes the demon and we next meet him years later having found sanctuary in an English monastery.After a prophetic dream, the Abbot tells Kane he must leave to find atonement for his sins.  His travels eventually lead him to meet a Puritan family called the Crowthorns including father William (Postlethewaite), mother Katherine (Krige) daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood), along with their two sons.  While Kane is scouting ahead, the family is attacked by the corrupted soldiers of a Malachi, an evil sorcerer, Kane  The soldiers kill the Crownthorn men and kidnap Meredith.  Kane has sworn to never kill again but he is forced to break his vow to battle the evil stalking the land and rescue Meredith.Solomon Kane had less than half the budget ($40 million) versus the 2011 Conan the Barbarian film ($90 million) but you certainly cannot tell.  This is a film that uses every dime to its fullest.  It captures the bleak look of England in the early 1600s that matches the essence of the Robert E. Howard stories.  It&#8217;s dark, gray, and barren and seemingly lacking in hope and happiness.Bassett&#8217;s story overreaches somewhat by trying to be too epic in scale. The final battle against the giant fire demon (which looks way too much like a Balrog) came off as self-indulgent.  Howard&#8217;s Kane stories were decidedly smaller and regional in scale.  Kane&#8217;s stories were often personal, however, and Bassett&#8217;s screenplay does have that feel.  Kane isn&#8217;t concerned with saving the kingdom.  He only wants to fulfill his vow to the dying William Crowthorn and save his daughter.  You must credit Bassett for delivering an R rated film that seethes with the savage violence of the source material.  Heads and limbs are cleaved with regularity and without apology.Unlike Howard&#8217;s muscle-bound Conan and Kull, Kane was always described as lean but wiry. Purefoy absolutely nails Kane in every way possible.  Sure the costume department did their job with Kane&#8217;s traditional slouched hat, dark cloak, rapier, dirk, and pistols, but credit Purefoy for making Kane real.  From his voice, to his emotions and to his mannerisms, he IS Solomon Kane.  While Purefoy is outstanding in the lead role he is bolstered by an outstanding supporting cast including Postlethwaite, Krige, Jason Flemying, and Max Von Sydow (who ironically had a bit role in the 1982 Conan film) as Kane&#8217;s father.The Solomon Kane film was released in the UK in 2009 and even though it seemed to be on the literal slow boat, it has finally made its way to U.S. shores and Howard fans can finally rejoice!Blu-Ray ExtrasAudio Commentary with Michael J.

1.0,"As soon as the show started, I knew it wasn't going to go well.  The musical arrangements in the musical numbers lacks all originality and the lyrics aren't funny or interesting.  It seems that they decided rhyming was enough to make the songs work, but they aren't very good songs and I am not even sure they were trying to make them funny.  The rest of the writing is pretty similar -- while it's not atrocious, there's just no substance and nothing really works.  The premise is decent and the actors all seem capable, but I don't see how this show could work as a series; it's just not funny.  There might be a funny show somewhere in this premise, but the pilot doesn't even show enough promise to warrant a reworking of this material.",1366675200,2013-04-23

4.0,"&#34;I did what I was supposed to do, I checked all the boxes.&#34; Jason (Efron) has just been dumped, even though he didn't know he was dating. Mikey's wife wants a divorce and Daniel (Teller) is...still single. One night they decide to make a pact, they will all stay single and not get into a real relationship. What starts off as an easy idea becomes tougher when Jason meets Ellie, Daniel spends more time with Chelsea and Mikey sees his wife again. Now the hardest part is trying to keep what each one is doing a secret from the others. First of all I will say that this is a pretty funny movie and I do recommend this. On the other hand the characters Jason and Daniel are kind of hard to root for. They both have their redeeming qualities and are great when they are with the girls they like, but when they are with their friends they are awful people and really unlikable. This is really nothing more then another American Pie type movie with aspects of Judd Apatow. I liked it and laughed all the way through. The only negative thing about it is that it is so predictable but when you watch movies like this you expect that anyway. Overall, funny and light hearted. A movie that both sexes will like about equally. I give this a high B+.",1399766400,2014-05-11

5.0,"The premise was fulfilled. Take a very complex machine, newly designed and built, place several space experienced tech-nauts aboard. For the first time send humans, past the moon towards Jupiter's moon Europa, only because a robot craft had detected liquid water beneath thick ice crust. More then a year out to destination, have them deal with all the physical and mental stresses. Expect them to arrive the same people they started out as, and take their unproven machines, land safely, explore safely, discover safely and firstly, send all information back safely, then, if they can, lift off safely, return to their main ship and return to Earth.., safely.  The odds of humans returning safely, under such circumstances are not high. Until many have attempted and died to 'field' test' the concepts, technology and strategies for coping with humans under alien conditions, for incredible periods of time, catastrophes will occur. Machines will fail, people will fail.The only thing in the mission that was planned well and had the highest odds of succeeding was the broadcast of knowledge back to humanity. The crew or some members were not given good odds of returning safely. Humans may be the best bio-quantum computers to send out, but they are also the most fragile and vulnerable to failure.  Yes, communications did break down, but that was necessary to the plot, for it made the individuals fight harder to survive, even if they must, individually sacrifice their lives. Someone had to survive to relay the incredible news to Earth.  Of course after they all perished, communications miraculously returned and the shattering news was received. Makes ya wonder, if the aliens under the ice, interfered with the transmissions, suckered the humans down to their deaths, ate them up or whatever, then released the transmissions to entice the rest of humanity to come visit their mysterious world. Humans are suckers for solving mysteries and becoming victims.., we are sooo delicious.If one is to view this realistically, the plot was sound, the personalities were reasonable. Their purpose and decision making was reasonable, and they accomplished their mission.., which is really what human endeavors are all about. Whether you're sent to dig a ton of coal or gold 1/2 mile underground or search for diamonds on Mars, your mission is to retrieve information and results for those waiting safely above.  The crew must have hope of their safe return to encourage them to go, but they must have some doubts tucked away in the back of their minds, which only surface as one technical or human failure begins to occur after another.Even in the midst of impending doom, the 'lone survivor', clings tenaciously to the hope she will make it back.It was a decently produced and acted presentation of 'what if'.  If you really want to make a difference for humanity 'discover' something significant.  Thus, Einstein, Dawkins, Henry Ford, Darwin, Madame Curie, Pasteur, S. Jobs, Galileo, products like fire, wheels, velcro, zippers, internal combustion engines, Butter, beer, vinegar, planes, trains, cars, rockets. Discover, invent and create Something significant.., and you don't have to survive for it to make a difference for those whole are to come.  Good subtle flick.",1390176000,2014-01-20
1.0,"I seriously do not understand why people can give this piece of $@%& a positive review, the only reason I can think of is that these people either worked on this film or are sadistic and want you to suffer. This was bad.. terribly bad. It is the kind of movie where people literally walked away from in the theater.>>> SPOILERS &lt;&lt;&lt;This film does not deserve a well thought out review but I will try and give a few examples of why I think of this movie so awful.Like the other reviewers already mentioned, this is a found footage film. However, the manner in which the footage is tied together is so random that you could die from a seizure in the theater.The problem of this film is the collection of situations and actions in those situations that make up this movie as a whole. Literally every scene is worth a serious face palm. The film starts with a random (and way to long) low quality introduction of the setting, followed by a first victim of the parasite, and it goes down from there. There are scientists that find weird unexplainable parasites and jump into the water to take a look. There are two befriended police officers that come across a house with screaming people, one goes into the house with his gun drawn, the other stays in the car with his seat belt on. There is an agency that specializes in outbreaks (viral, bacterial.. whatever) and does not seem to give a damn when they hear about the mysterious issue's in the town. There is a supposedly intelligent couple (dentist & lawyer) that walk into a ghost town filled with dead bodies near the end of the film.. with their few months old baby.. and the guy actually thinks what he sees is funny!? The list goes on and on.. 2 hours of this crapThen there is the science.. like the only other review I could relate with pointed out. The science is made up by a 5 year old. All conclusions that are drawn, numbers that are given, idea's that are thought of.. it is terribly. Just when you hear something that might be vaguely plausible or logical. i.e. the explanation that anomalies could come from pesticides.. nuclear leaks are drawn into the equation to make it sound better or whatever.. Everything about it is pretty pathetic.The overall story is also weak. I mean, maybe there could be made a half-decent film out of the idea behind the movie.. mutated flesh eating parasites, it sounds pretty cool right?.. but in the context of the rest of the film this story only adds to the train-wreck that is called ""The Bay""A part of me died while watching this film, I will never get it back, I'm scarred and I seriously want to kick the creator of this movie in the nuts.. or even better.. I want to go back in time and get raped in stead of watching this film.. I mean it.. getting raped is better!",1357171200,2013-01-03

5.0,I love this show! It has a great story line. Most people probably look at it and think oh no way am I going to watch a show about a massage therapist that gives happy endings but it's not just that. That is only a fraction of the show. It is mainly about a woman whose husband left her and her struggles of trying to keep her home and provide for her family all on her own. It teaches people that what she does is wrong but some people feel like that is their only option and the drama of the show is just awesome!

It is dark so one jumps in and the other follows without even checking the tank for a way of escape. Well the water is at a low level and they have a hard time getting out.I waited till the end to see if they ever could figure out how to get out and it was quite clever I will admit. But not everything goes right! The ladder was too high so they had to improvise. If I ever got stuck in this situation I will remember this trick but I won't get into this situation!,1390089600,2014-01-19
3.0,"The Colony an experiemtn in what would happen when a group of strangers must survive in a post apocoalyse world.  This season the major threat was a viral outbreak that has left much of the country if not the world on the brink of total collapse.Seven people quarrintined after seventy-two hours have been taken to a compund area in which the next fifty days they must find food, shelter, water and whatever else they need to survive this new world.  Along the way they must deal with outsiders, dwindling resoruces and other threats to thier very exsitance.This season was the first I saw on tv and when it came out on dvd I grabbed the first and watched them both.  I am a bit torn in that since season two was the first time watching it I was amazed at what they were able to do i nthe fifty days and at the same time amazed at what they should have been doing fom the begining. Hello security anyone?  The people themselves are a divrse lot with those you want to watch and those you wish they would just fall into a hole and never see again.

5.0,"All roads for Vic Mackey (Emmy winner Michael Chiklis) lead to this. After Mackey killed Terry Crowley during the first season of ""The Shield"" karma was going to catch up with him sooner than later and now the Strike Team is under I.A.D. investigation by Jon Kavanaugh (Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker). Mackey seemed on the road to redemption during the fourth season when the new captain (Glenn Close)gave him the chance to reassemble his team and make a difference in the Farmington police district. The investigation that she instigated which was designed to exonerate members of her team has turned into crusade where Kavanaugh will use any and all teams to bring down Mackey and his team.By the fifth season of ""The Shield"" I was afraid the show would jump the shark--in fact it has done anything but that with writing that is still among the best on TV with morally complex characters sporting shades of gray to their personalities vs. being simple black and white caricatures of good guys and bad guys. Chiklis proves as he has over the last four seasons to be one of the best actors on TV with his complex portrayal of Mackey. Chiklis though wouldn't be where he is without the terrific supporting cast. During the fifth season Mackey's nemesis begins to resemble him as he tries to bring down Mackey and his team. Mackey may be morally corrupt person but there is still a decent person buried somewhere within his soul which allows fans of the series to be rooting for him even if he is often the bad guy (hey, he killed a cop in the first episode of the first season!).The show looks grainy and dark which benefits the cinema verite/documentary look of the show with its handheld cameras and unexpected pans. As always Dutch(Jay Karnes) and Claudette (CCH Pounder)continue to be the moral center and conscience of the show and as fascinating as Mackey and his team are, these two detectives are equally as fascinating as they bring down a serial killer with perfect alibies and other difficult to crack cases. The politically astute former Captain of the station David Aceveda (Benito Martinez)continues to have a darkness to his ""moral"" character particularly after the physical assualt at the hands of an ex-con that occurred during the third season.The DVD has some great special features including commentary tracks with a nice mix of cast members, a featurette on the productio of the fifth season, a tribute to executive producer/director Scott Brazil who died during the sixth season and a Q&A; session with Chiklis, producer/writer/creator Shawn Ryan and Forrest Whitaker discussing their characters and the development of the series. We also get deleted scenes as well as the sixth season ""prequel"" that sets up season six.The seventh season (which will air this spring)is reportedly the last season for the show so if you've caught the bug for ""The Shield"" but fallen behind in watching the show, now you can spent time either catching the reruns or watching the DVDs in plenty of time for season seven.Highly recommended.",1183680000,2007-07-06
2.0,"Something was missing with this one. It just seemed less fun. There was alot of off island action where 3 of the main characters were searching for the mcguffin, in this case Crowley's Father's ashes, and while it was a nice change of scenery, the movie also got away from the action and slowed immensely. I also found the character of Amanda to be annoying, she seemed like the Scrappy Doo of the movie. That being said, the kills were inventive and fun as usually. And there were some funny moments. Basically newcomers to the series, should stay away and just watch the first two films instead. But, if your a fan, give it watch, it ain't all bad.

5.0,"Season 6 arrived in the midst of much outrage over the departures of Mary Birdsong (""Deputy Cherisha Kimball""), Wendi McLendon-Covey (""Deputy Clementine ""Clemmie"" Johnson), and Carlos Alazraqui (""Deputy James Garcia"").But let's get real for a minute. Each of these characters represented one-note solos, much like Neil Young's ""Cinnamon Girl,"" but in a much less effective way.Kimball: ""Is she or isn't she?"" If you're like me, you stopped caring.Johnson: ""Round round get around I get around""...yes, Deputy Johnson got around, and the joke grew a long, gray beard.Garcia: Set-up for low-rent Hispanic jokes. 'nuff said.We still have Dangle, Travis Junior, Wiegel, and Jones...the core of the ensemble...and that's close enough for rock and roll. We also have ""former sex slave Cindy""...the wonderful and gorgeous Wanru Tseng...so while the glory days of the series may be in the past, having the show around for another season is nothing to sneeze at. ESPECIALLY when the season opens with Dangle proclaiming ""I thought we were canceled!""Reno 911 is an acquired taste. I thought the movie really missed the mark, and was the only true failure so far. Season 6 won't displace the prior 5 seasons as ""best season ever"" by ANY means, but if you are a fan of those seasons, it is ""glass half empty, glass half full"" time.I was personally grateful to have 15 new episodes of one of the most irreverent TV series of all time.",1248048000,2009-07-20

5.0,"I honestly thought that Bosch would be my favorite new original show, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mozart of the Jungle was just as engaging. The premise is nothing new, but the twist is that instead of country, pop, rock, or rap, we get a peek into the world of Classical music, one of the oldest and most revered styles today. This lends itself well to the decadent parties and attitudes of those who've made it, and explains the young but out there style of those still hoping to succeed.The cast is young, attractive, and most importantly talented. The lead is charming and engaging. Malcolm McDowell is flawless, as always, Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal plays the eccentric young genius very well, and Saffron Burrows smolders nicely as the experienced voice of wisdom.

5.0,"CEREMONY is one of the brighter starts to rise out of Hollywood this year. Though it was made in 2010 and released on Demand TV  before its ultimate release on theaters, it is hopefully going to gather the audience it so richly deserves.  It is a young work: the writer/director is Max Winkler, son of Henry Winkler, a bright young talent who essentially makes his debut with little sparkler. Not only has he come up with a fresh idea for a story but he has also matched that story with a script that is at all times warmly entertaining and at many points a sensitive, philosophical examination of relationships today. And he has cast the film with some of the finest young actors on screen at present.Sam Davis (Michael Angarano, a brilliant young actor in his early 20s, so memorable in the deeply touching 'One Last Thing') writes children's books and lives in the child like fantasies of kids.  He has a friend Marshall Schmidt (Reece Thompson, another early 20s bright young talent) who happens to show up as the only member of an audience to hear Sam read his latest new children's book.  The two boys rekindle their friendship, stagnant for the past year while Marshall recovered from an altercation and hid in his parents home while Sam had a momentary encounter with a beautiful 30s something woman Zoe (Uma Thurman).  The two lads decide to take a little trip to ostensibly to get Marshall out of his parent's home to see the world, but in actuality Sam has heard that Zoe is marrying some wealthy guy, Whit Coutell (Lee Pace, another brilliant actor remembered for his shattering performance in 'Soldier's Girl'), at Whit's lavish seaside home.Sam and Marshall mend long absent feelings of closeness and taking some daring steps they drive to the seaside estate, obtain an invitation to Zoe's party (her wedding to Whit Actually) from Zoe's drunken brother Teddy (Jake  M. Johnson).  Sam confronts Zoe, stating his love and his desire to marry her, but Zoe needs more than a young kid to satisfy her and sees the opportunities of marrying the moneyed Whit.  In a series of incidents both hilarious at times and deeply tender at others all characters discover new concepts of relationships.  How the film ends is left for the viewer to discover.Michael Angarano is pitch perfect as Sam, a young man whose ideals are tested and who must learn the adult role.  His skills are so polished at this young stage in his career that he is bound to become a major star.  Reece Thompson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman gives one of her most well rounded performances.  Lee Pace makes the most of his role, sparkling as the reigning optimist of the story.  But in the end most of the credit for the success of this little gem is due to the talent of Max Winkler who writes as well as he directs: he is a formidable force.  Highly Recommended.

3.0,"Be warned: some folks sense of humor can be maudlin.  And, as anyone can tell humor, humor is indeed a difficult concept.  It's certainly one that doesn't always translate (or transmit) well from person to person: what one person finds funny, another finds depressing.  Such is life, and such is the case with STRUCK BY LIGHTNING, GLEE's Chris Colfer's debut project.  Colfer wrote and headlined the picture, and, while I've no problems whatsoever with his acting chops, methinks his script could've used a bit more maturity in order to graduate from class.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Here, let me spoil it for you: high school senior Carson Phillips (played by Colfer) is dead.  In case you missed it in the title, he's the one who's been struck by lightning.Now, before you get all high and mighty on me, let me remind you that (A) my second paragraph already spelled out the fact that there would be spoilers and (B) if you're at all interested in this film, then you'll know only a few minutes in much the same: Phillips is dead, and he's narrating his story for the audience in flashback because - as a precocious and world-weary spirit at his ripe young age - he has lessons he feels need to be imparted to you, the viewer.See what I did there?  I did exactly what Colfer does with the `moral to his story': he delivers the impact right outta the gate, and then he spends 84 minutes proselytizing about how life ain't fair, how high school sucks, how parents are incompetent, and how you'd better live a life of dreams before it's too late.  And I did it in only a handful of paragraphs.  Now, I've save you 84 minutes you can use for actually achieving some of your life's goals.  You can thank me later.That's what I mean about `humor.'  What works in STRUCK are the niceties - the little things - the quirks of young relationships; the stereotypical talking heads that populate a young person's life (especially the school guidance counselor who's more interested in securing a complimentary, free juice cup than she is concerned about your future); and the like.  Colfer hasn't quite experienced a full life, and, unfortunately, his script revolves around the very basic observations of a relatively young man.  That isn't a bad thing; it's just limiting.  That's why STRUCK is also populated by bad or tragically flawed adults that take the shape of a wryly comic but still abusive mother (has Allison Janney skills for anything else?), a dismissive father (Dermot Mulroney), and a school receptionist who's possibly part pedophile.There are plenty of other television stars packed in here - to the gills! - including Christina Hendricks, Sarah Hyland, and Angela Kinsey.  To Colfer's credit, he does give everyone a good moment or two, which gives the picture a nice touch.  Unfortunately, the fully advertised premise of the film - that Carson is intent on extorting his fellow high schoolers in order to get what he wants - doesn't begin until halfway through the run-time, and, as a result, STRUCK feels like it was struck by lightning all a little too late.An impressive first attempt, but I'll be expecting better the next time out.STRUCK BY LIGHTNING is produced by Permut Presentations, Camellia Entertainment, Evil Media Empire, and Inphenate.  DVD distribution is being handled by New Video.  As for the technical specifications, the film is extremely well-made with crisp images, fairly predictable cinematography, and excellent sound work.  As for the special features, there are a few, including a behind-the-scene short, an interview with Colfer and director Brian Dannelly, bloopers (17 minutes worth!), and a few deleted scenes.  It's a nice package - all of them are worth a look - so everyone involved should be commended.RECOMMENDED.  STRUCK BY LIGHTNING is a far cry from the zeitgeist works of John Hughes.  Hughes near-definitive take on being adolescent in such films as PRETTY IN PINK, SIXTEEN CANDLES, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB appear to be fairly safely mounted on their respective pedestals if Colfer's work is any indication; and that's actually quite sad.  Much of Colfer's script is winning - he admirably captures the sensibilities of the small-town boy with the big-city dreams and fairly consistently tweaks the basic high school archetypes (prom queen, cheerleader, athletes, druggies, nerds, etc.); the problem is - as most Hollywood creations do - he's also intent on smothering all of the good under the typical Tinseltown indictments of middle America (mom's a closeted substance abuser, dad's a deadbeat loser, principals don't give two squirts about students, etc.) the way a good Progressive/Liberal does.  Nice try, son, but maybe you should stick to singing.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD copy of STRUCK BY LIGHTNING by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1369267200,2013-05-23

It really is a vomit-inducing show now that grasps for highs and lows with poor writing and uninteresting scenarios.  If you need a good eye-rolling workout, watch it.  If not, avoid.Some shows just get boring.  This is one of those.  They go on too long and lose that spark that they held in the beginning.  Their writers run out of decent ideas and characters to have sex with each other and believable plot twists, yet go on and on simply to keep collecting paychecks.  Like ladies of the night who have no education, they keep pumping out episodes, praying to the gods for gold.  Instead, they just muddy up our airwaves and cable boxes with diseased, hackneyed, and unwanted melodrama.

4.0,"Shooting is inherently boring. Other shooting shows like 'Sons of Guns' finish each episode with a shooting demo. But they always have a successful hit punctuated with a huge orange fireball explosion. Trust me. Shooting not like that. If I hit the bulls eye I find out by looking at a tiny round hole in a piece of paper.Top Shot has always had the best production values. They film and direct their shooting competition so as to extract the maximum amount of suspense and drama.But last season their backstory almost swamped the whole show. They also had teams who lived together and interacted when not on the firing range. But they included a crazy guy last season who tried to pick fist fights, who kept everyone else awake at night and who would employ any underhanded ploy to gain an advantage. He was black which lent a racial element to the proceedings. The whole thing was hard to watch.This season they have cut down on the dormitory psychodrama and emphasized the shooting.Good!",1370044800,2013-06-01

The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how ""normal"" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.

2.0,"This is an okay series with some interesting scifi elements. It's good enough that it will keep you interested without insulting your intelligence, until E13. Here's why: (could be a spoiler)(1) Big Jim gets the people of Chester's Mill riled about Barbie shooting and murdering people, while Big Jim is the real murderer. So far so good. The key person that BJ tells the town that Barbie shot, who is not dead yet, is Julie Shumway. Of course, Julie Shumway is the only one who can verify that Barbie did not shoot her. Also, both the kid and the nurse helping Julia Shumway observe a distraught Barbie doing what he can so save her.(2) So, Julia Shumway is the key witness that could incriminate BJ, if she recovers from the gunshot wound inflicted by another person besides Barbie. BJ will, for that reason, kill her if she recovers, and this is important. Important because this is what proves BJ is a liar. Julie Shumway was not shot by Barbie because she's alive to say who actually did shoot her-duh?That's it, done deal, Big Jim is a liar anyway he tries to spin it. Both the nurse and the young kid can also verify that Barbie is the one who actually saved Julia's life. So now we have three witnesses that contradict what BJ is saying about Barbie.So in the case you're thinking that BJ could lie his way out of it, I offer this: Barbie shot Julia Shumway and tried to kill her, but at the same time Barbie saves her life, but for some reason Julie Shumway is lying that Barbie didn't shot her. Right. That's believable--by a retard.Intellectually insulting. More importantly, when writers take that much liberty, they need to explain why, and if they do not, it means anything can happen regardless of believability. When that happens, it lowers the IQ of the entire series because it becomes UNBELIEVABLE.The series at this point moves to a purely emotional level and leaves all reason wanting.",1380067200,2013-09-25

4.0,"I was suprised by how much I enjoyed this show. It is not deep and meaningful by any means. But it's funny as hell!It's not a show where you watch and say &#34;Wow I can really relate to this family&#34; because this family is so incredibly screwed up it's rediculous. (But they still seem to love each other even though they are always fighting with each other)It's the comedy that ensues from their constant fighting that brings the laughs. Normally I hate plot lines like that because they cater to the notion that loving families are strange and bad. But somehow this show walks that tightrope and makes it funny.When you get to the episode where Will Arnett and the mother scream at each other in a battle about family while re-enacting the courtroom scene from A Few Good Men, you'll know what I mean. You will have to rewind it a few times to see what you missed while clutching your sides in laughter, but you'll eventually see what I mean.I don't see this has having a 10 year run. Nor do I see myself and being sad if they canceled it tomorrow. But as long as they keep putting it on TV I'll keep watching and laughing.",1399593600,2014-05-09

4.0,"Hannibal isn't violent, however there is gore. But above all, it is an intelligent battle of wits. The acting takes center stage even above the excellent filming and editing.The characters are all well defined (except Alana) and, again... cannot stress it enough... the acting is excellent.Season 2 is delicious battle of wits --- but you must watch season 1 to get the feel and flow of it. We know who's going to &#34;win&#34;, of course. But the dance is so delicious, so elegant... yes, elegant. The smirk on Hannibal's face as he plays his games with people, planting a seed just to see what they will do.This is not a typical show at all. It's like a movie. Everything is done so well.

2.0,"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction.  When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety.  It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes.  When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing.  Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two.  I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases.  Personally, I didn't agree with the decision--but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included.  Anyone who read the box knew what to expect--how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Not so for ""American Restoration, Volume One!""  I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside.  Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package)--it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting.  I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics?  I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information.  My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base.  I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!I, however, will tell you what is inside.  The 2 DVD set has sixteen episodes:  all four from the abbreviated Season One and the first twelve from Season Two.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were sixteen episodes on the DVD box?Season One: (1) Hopalong Rock, (2) Ice Cold, (3) Lights Out, and (4) Buttered Up.Season Two: (1) Cooler Kings, (2) Knockout, (3) Duck and Cover, (4)Pumped Up, (5) Space Kowboy, (6) Jackpot, (7) Safe Keeping, (8) Suck Up, (9) Rev'd Up, (10) Apples and X-Rays, (11) Hot & Cold, and (12) Secret Fan.Actual Review:I will be brief in my actual review since I already went on a tirade.  ""American Restoration"" is an offshoot of the popular ""Pawn Stars,"" and fits comfortably into the History Channel's stable of reality based programming.  Its star (Rick Dale) made semi-regular appearances on that program, but now we get a closer look at what he does.  Based in Las Vegas, Dale and team locate objects that might be of value (or represent lost bits of Americana) and figure out ways to restore the item to its former glory.  It's an easy show to like and fascinating especially if you enjoy antiquing or modern day treasure hunting shows (Pawn Stars, Storage Wars and others).  I found it very interesting to see the different techniques of this unusual art form--and I do think Dale is an artist!  The program itself merits four stars.  KGHarris, 11/11.",1320537600,2011-11-06
5.0,"I was in high school during the 50s and they were tumultuous times despite all the romance and lure of Rock N Roll, etc. The 50s are nostalgic but also rift with very evil things done by this country as well as Russia. The communist mentality of the the McCarthy Era defies all logic and is hard to imagine something so medieval actually took place in the U.S. and was supported by people. This show is interesting because it shows the steps both the U.S. and Russian spy agencies went through to infiltrate each others cultures. I'm sure we had their counterparts living and pretending to be Russians as well. Good chemistry between main characters. Both respond as real people. Granted, Russian indoctrination was drummed into candidates so they often struggle. Hope there is a 2nd season.",1392854400,2014-02-20

2.0,"I first heard about ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW in a short article in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY in the fall of 2013. After reading the article, it made me really eager to see the film: a movie that was secretly filmed at Disney&#8217;s amusement parks without their permission?! The movie is now available on DVD and recently I was able to finally watch it.Although it was secretly filmed at both Disney World and Disneyland, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is set at Disney World. The film centers around the character of Jim (Roy Abramsohm). Jim White and his family are on their last day of vacation at the &#8220;most magical place on Earth.&#8221; His wife and kids are getting dressed and ready for the day when Jim receives a telephone call from his boss informing him that he is fired. Jim is upset by the news, but decides not to tell his wife or kids anything because he doesn&#8217;t want to spoil their trip. While on the patio talking to his boss, Jim notices a strange white van below that is seen later on again in the movie. While on the patio, Jim&#8217;s son, Elliot (Jack Dalton) locks him out of the hotel room. These minor events foreshadow terrible things to happen later in the movie and it quickly becomes apparent that although they might appear like a typical American family, there are some serious issues with Jim&#8217;s family. Jim&#8217;s wife is domineering and berates her husband as though he is a tv sitcom dad. Jim, on the other hand, is clearly looking for some excitement in his life and his wandering eye catches the figure of two barely-teenage French girls. At least one of them seem infatuated by his gazes and Jim ends up following them throughout the park. As the movie progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to figure out exactly what is going on. The viewer isn&#8217;t sure if the things Jim sees are real or part of his imagination. They don&#8217;t know if Jim is on some kind of drugs, is just imagining, or is being mentally affected by a disease in his brain. The Small World creatures turn into horrific little imps with teeth, a person is beheaded, there&#8217;s a terrible terminal disease called Cat Flu that&#8217;s going around the park, and Jim is seduced (and maybe drugged) by a former Disney character princess. All the while the French girls come and go in so many places that it can&#8217;t possibly be coincidence. Viewers also discover that the Disney character princess are actually high-class hookers for Asian businessmen, that food that&#8217;s sold as turkey legs are actually emu legs, and that Epcot and the rest of the Disney parks are just one massive experiment in human social engineering.In terms of film making and cinematic achievement, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is notable for the guerilla-way that the movie was made. Although the movie is set at Disney parks, Disney had no association with the movie, The cast and crew dressed in tourist clothes, the cast&#8217;s scripts were available only through their smart phones, and sometimes the cast went through the same ride almost thirty times in one day. The director became so paranoid that the movie might be discovered by Disney before it was finished that he went to South Korea to edit it so there would be no leaks. It is a testament to the director&#8217;s skill and passion that the movie even exists.With that said, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is a terrible movie. The movie is marketed as a horror movie, but the only real horror of the film is its absurdity and nonsensicality. Jim spends the majority of his time in the film chasing around two barely-teenage French girls with the determination of a creeper out of a snuff film. There&#8217;s no explanation of who these girls are, what their purpose is, and why they are featured so much. The acting isn&#8217;t terrible, but (other than Jim&#8217;s daughter) there isn&#8217;t a character in the movie that is likeable. For instance, Jim is the central figure of the film but he&#8217;s not really a very likeable person: he stalks the French girls through the park like a crazy creeper, he yells at another creepy man on a scooter for no real apparent reason, he commits adultery while his daughter sleeps in the next room, and he never once compliments his wife. There is definitely some marital conflict between Jim and his wife, but the movie never addresses it and instead, like the news of his firing, it&#8217;s just not mentioned. Jim is kidnapped by a robot scientist, but it&#8217;s never made clear exactly what Jim was supposed to have done or what his part in this grand experiment was. There&#8217;s been some comparisons of ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW to David Lynch movies. There is a similar vibe there, but as weird as his projects often are, most Lynch movies at least have a discernible narrative that can be followed. There really is no narrative in ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW. After I finished watching the movie, I thought to myself, &#8220;What a waste.&#8221;ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW will always be remembered as a side note (the movie made at Disney that Disney didn&#8217;t know about) instead of the actual movie itself. As a movie, it&#8217;s an absurdist nightmare that lacks any real meaning and coherence.",1400198400,2014-05-16

3.0,"Modern conspiracy theories are common these days, but they've been with us forever, as evidenced by theories about missing Ninth Legion of the Roman Empire. Centurion explains what happened to the Ninth from the point of view of someone who was there.Our hero, Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) becomes part of the Ninth's destiny when Picts overrun his garrison. He escapes, only to discover that Roman governor of Brittania, Julius Agricola (Paul Freeman), has committed the general of the Ninth Legion, Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) to eradicate the Pict threat.  Their secret weapon is Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a mute Bringantian scout.  With his inside knowledge, it's not long before Dias acts as Virilus' right hand man against the Picts. SPOILTURION: If you know your Roman history, you know this isn't going to end well.Legendary Roman discipline fails in the face of the devious Picts and a surprise betrayal leaves just a handful of men alive.  When they discover Virilus has been captured deep in enemy territory, Dias and his ragtag band form a desperate rescue mission. Along the way the men bond and betray one another, as each falls to privation and violence.This is a gritty movie with few likable characters.  Children, prisoners, and even cooks are murdered as a matter of expedience. The main antagonist has no speaking parts, which makes for an unusual villain.  Most of the movie takes place in the sweeping countryside, a character unto itself.Centurion is more interested in legend than fact.  The Picts are a conglomeration of everything Romans ever reported about them - women warriors, lime in the hair, blue battle paint and all.  This at least makes them more interesting than the typical dirty barbarian types that usually act as villains in films of this sort.Unfortunately, Centurion's plot is as serpentine as a Roman column.  There are long stretches of countryside views that, while beautiful, begin to drag. The audio is muffled - I'm starting to think is a problem endemic to outdoor war films, because King Arthur had the same problem. When Dias finally decides to stand and fight, it's an exciting battle...and then the film limps along to resolve two other major plot points.  The script could have used more polishing.What it lacks in plot, Centurion tries to make up with gore. This is a crazy-violent movie, with more gore than most horror films.  One of the first battle scenes has so many limbs chopped off, heads sawed in half, and gurgling throat cuts that it really detracted from the movie as a whole.  The bloody effects -- an artifact of the movie 300, which seems to have made every producer assume they can get away with CGI blood - look cartoony.  At one point, a guy's head explodes when he runs into a tree.All this adds up to an ambitious but uneven movie.  Centurion tries many different things and only succeeds at half of them.  But the half it succeeds at makes for a decent film.",1323561600,2011-12-11

5.0,"When this series first aired I thought it would be a typical clone series of Friends or Joey or the like but to my surprise and happiness I found it actually has a talented and entertaining cast who keep the series more enjoyable as each season comes out.  I like how it plays on the seemingly stereotypical lifestyles of the vastly intelligent but socially awkward and socially talented but slight less intelligent academically and not always in the same group as you would think.  Many people have wondered if the series has a laugh track like some of the early 80's to mid 90's shows, while you do hear laughter it's actually from an audience rather then a mechanical laugh track.Still if you find it annoying to hear laughter in some of the scenes then this series is one you might want to pass over, while it doesn't distract you from what's going on in the scenes more then half the episodes will have for obvious reasons laughing in them. If you're still unsure of the series I'd say get the first season especially for the price it's going for and see whether or not you will become a fan as I highly suspect or this is a series you'll want to pass over either way I still say the series is worth a try.",1348531200,2012-09-25

It is a magnificent glimpse into the plotting, back room dealing and intrigue that went on in the Roman royal family during the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula and Claudius.  Claudius' grandmother, Livia, is especially deadly.  I've lost count of all of the family members she poisoned or had murdered.  In some regards, it's amazing that any of them survived.  Sadly, it seemed all of the better members of the royal household ended up dead, and the worst ones, like Tiberius and Caligula, somehow managed to survive.Great story.  Great acting.

Dunst is a sunny delight to watch.After seeing the film I read a bit about the actual event that prompted the story and that filled in some of the missing piece about Deborah, the friend of the husband.

The relationship between the inspector and his sergeant continues to develop from the rocky start of season 1.

I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language, English.

4.0,It's good...it's *worth* buying...but I have to admit that the series is missing...something...that the writing of the original Avatar had. I worry for its survival...it feels like they're in danger of shark jumping.,1400284800,2014-05-17
5.0,"My curiosity is what made me get this. I was worried that they couldn't bring this together conceptually. This show is set in the now, but  the original movie was set in the 50's?  But once you start watching the character's and plot are so interesting that I didn't find myself caring so much. The first few minutes gets your attention and you just want to know more and more. The tone of the show is a bit spooky. The mom is a real piece of work, and Norman is a likeable, sweet boy. You can totally put together why he ends up the guy from Psycho. There is a lot going on in this show to get and keep you hooked. Not to spoil anything but the first few episodes has a possible murder and cover-up, a rape, a definite murder and cover-up, a sex trade hostage, a bulldog sheriff, a dangerous deputy, and an illegal drug operation that the whole town might be a part of. Yep, it's a roller-coaster.  If you like shows like Smallville and Supernatural (I do) then I think you will like this.",1368144000,2013-05-10
3.0,The  show has improved and the language is not quite as bad in the later episodes but the stereotypes are over the top and badly one sided.  Please be fair and show both sides to be as bad as they are.,1389916800,2014-01-17

3.0,For a pilot this was great.  I need to see more of it to decide if i will really like the series or not but I suspect the show will make it through it's first season.It is entertaining and interesting definitely worth a watch and a look at the second episode.,1190419200,2007-09-22
4.0,I disliked every single character but the mystery of what is happening around them is quite engaging.  After watching the pilot I want to see more.  This is a very scifi show and it reminds me a bit of World war Z and The walking dead without zombies.  I think it has a LOT of potential.  I would definitely watch more if it were available.,1393545600,2014-02-28

However, I have not followed the Universal Soldiers saga since the original film, so i can understand how fans of the series are disappointed in this project. Personally, i thought Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren were the worst parts of the movie, particularly the stupid speeches Dolph kept giving about being free.

3.0,"I'm intrigued by this show.  But, it didn't grab me until the end when the demon with all the tattoos showed up.  Before that, it played like just another disaster flick on the SciFi channel, predictable and too formulaic with stereotypical characters like the fugitive.  They really should have created a different character for Aldis Hodge because this is a waste of a huge talent, plus I hate seeing another brotha portrayed as a convict, whether he's innocent or not.  In fact, Aldis Hodge was the only reason why I watched this pilot, so that was disappointing.  But, if this show makes the cut, then I will definitely check it out to see what this demon thing is all about.",1391990400,2014-02-10

4.0,Fun monster flick with a great ensemble cast and a creature that looks somewhat like the creature in feast.A group of people are trapped in an abandened house in the middle of the woods after being chased or hunted there by The &#34;Animal&#34;.There are people from three different parties trapped and things get heated inside the house as well as outside as the creature stalks his prey.I don't know what's worse the animals inside trying to survive or the one they are trying to avoid.There are some pretty brutal scenes of bloody violence but not a lot of gore.I enjoyed it and I'm a big KeKe Palmer fan as well.,1404172800,2014-07-01
3.0,"The thinking man's comic books that were the Marvel brand, featuring titles such as THE FANTASTIC FOUR, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK, came to be thanks largely to a gentleman known as Stan Lee.  Those who don't realize Marvel's contribution to popular culture should see the 2013 documentary WITH GREAT POWER: THE STAN LEE STORY.  Those who do have probably already seen it; certainly the film's tone does not fall short in presenting fans who praise Marvel writer-editor Lee.But I'd rather appreciate WITH GREAT POWER: THE STAN LEE STORY for its strengths, first and foremost that it shows comic books are not necessarily just a part of childhood culture, something that has to end when a kid moves on from superheroes to, say, MAD magazine.  While not the sole example, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN's adaptation into several successful motion pictures and, most recently, a Broadway musical stands as strong support of that notion.Age 53 as I write this, I realize that the poorly made cartoons based on Marvel Comics in the 1960s reflected a cheap cash-in on the brand's popularity but the first-rate motion pictures - most recently, IRON MAN, starring one of film's premiere actors, no less - live up to the spirit of Stan Lee and his collaborators because the filmmakers were the ones who bought those comic books when they were children.",1397001600,2014-04-09
5.0,World war 2 is one of my favorite time periods and this takes place in England during the war. I wish there were more seasons to watch unfortunately this was the last season only bad thing about British TV the series end,1388361600,2013-12-30
4.0,"A brilliant thriller with great writing and even better acting.  David Tennant shines in this film as Will Burton a brilliant criminal barrister (laywer for us Americans) running the gambit of emotions and taking the viewer along for the ride.  The supporting actors were just as great with Sophie Okonedo as Maggie, Will's opposite, who is driven to beet Will at any cost.  Then their is Toby Kebbell  who gives a chilling portrayal of Liam Foyle the murderer in this piece.  Their are many twists and turns in this film that makes you give thought to what is the Law and what is Justice and what is Moral.  Knowing someone is guilty and proving it are two different things. It also makes you think what you would do in the same situation.I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because this is not the PBS/Masterpiece version but the BBC DVD version.  The two were cut a little different, in the PBS/Masterpiece version they cut small scenes that did not advance the story line but added scenes that in my mind were very important to the story line and made it make more sense .  For instance the relationship between Maggie an the DNA Lab Doctor that Maggie uses to find out about the extra cleaning of the lab and then uses so skillfully in court.  This also goes a long way to explain that Maggie would do anything to beet Will  weather it is wreck a relationship or go all the way to Scotland  to go against him.  Also an extra scene between Will and his wife and a scene where Will is watching Maggie on TV talking about home invasion and you see his frustration is rising.  Not that their is anything wrong with the BBC cut version, I have the DVD and love it but I just thought the version I saw on TV on my PBS station was better and was hoping this was it, which is why I purchased this too.I would recommend this to anyone who loves British Drama, brilliant acting and great writing.  Also I would recommend this to anyone who is a David Tennant fan, this is one of his best.  The last 10 min. of episode 3 is worth purchasing and watching the entire series for.",1404864000,2014-07-09

3.0,"As a fully animated series, this show has the potential to be a lot of fun.  However, I feel as if this show was written by a Scott Adam wannabe satirist that cobbled together plot points from Tripping the Rift and Farscape.  Successful animated series such as The Simpsons and Family Guy are able to seamlessly merge low-brow, slapstick humor with modern day references and politically incorrect subject matter.  Dark Minions has the potential to push the envelope of ""The Office""-style comedy by utilizing the animated stage and the open-ended environment of science fiction.  I will be watching the next episodes.  Good luck.",1366329600,2013-04-19
2.0,"As a longtime Ciaran Hinds fan, as well as one who relishes crime dramas that shed light on the workings of tortured minds (e.g.,Law & Order Criminal Intent), I could overlook the shortcomings of the first two-part episode (Anna's wobbly spike heels, the short skirt, the misty eyed but knowing looks, her thoroughly unprofessional demeanor, etc.), and gave it a rave review based on the strength of the final interrogation scene, dynamite, she showed what she's made of, mettle-wise, matching the perp in intensity.  His crimes made sense, though there were gruesome details galore, they struck me as realistic, not gratuitous or designed merely to shock.  I also liked the promise of the attraction between the two leads, where would it lead?  Then I watched ""seasons"" 2 and 3.Gratuitous, preposterous.  So many gaffes, overlooked leads and details, FOR EXAMPLE, ***SPOILER ALERT*** in Season 3, they did NO background check on the perp's brother (!), and they only thought to check on the whereabouts of the perp's son at the last minute- gosh, he might have gone there!  And no reporting of the knowledge of the plane, no typing in of the plane's serial number to see what/where it might be, absurd.  The final scene wherein Ciaran and Kelly abandon the car and RUN down the runway after the plane was one of the stupidest scenes EVER.  MANY plot points are left totally unexplained.  It's as though through some printing mishap every other page of the script failed to print and nobody noticed.RE: Season 2, if you thrive on the lurid and the depths of human depravity, much the same way horror fans watch zombies eating people's brains with glee, this may be your cup of tea, though I'm sure you'd like a story that makes SENSE as well.  ***BIG TIME SPOILER ALERT*** A father who not only commits the most gruesome of murders, but forces one victim to eat excrement before dismembering her, also sexually tortures his son and daughters, operates on and removes his daughter's reproductive organs, for FUN.  I couldn't overlook such blatant gratuitousness in any case, but there might have been SOME justification if we gained an understanding of such depravity, or the dynamics of the coppers' interpersonal relationships, or what makes the characters tick, but no such luck.  The leads and the other officers evince one-dimensional, erratic behavior that made NO sense.SO many errors, ludicrous; for example, one of the daughters assaults detectives on two separate occasions, drawing blood, and no-one says a word (they don't even fight back, one just slinks away)!  They don't arrest people for assaulting police officers in the UK?  Also, they had the perpetrator's voice on tape (I think, or SHOULD have taped his calls), early on could've matched the voice prints, AS WELL AS eyewitness identification of him, yet they don't arrest him, simply learn more appalling details with each visit then go back to the squad room and look at the horrific crime scene photos again.  When they finally do detain him, they sit him in an easy chair and serve him lunch, and, SURPRISE, he escapes.  And a detective sleeping with a reporter, ""accidentally"" affording him access to her case notes?  And with no repercussions?  COME ON.  Columbo or Inspector Morse this ain't.  Real UK cops must've had a field day with this twaddle.  I admit I was curious to see if things might improve in the final installment, but it's not a Prime offering so that sealed the deal.For lurid and close to the bone that DOES make sense, (to me, anyway), seeSingle Handed: Natural Justice, a VERY dark (and profane, be forewarned), but superb Irish series available on Instant Video.  And BOTH seasons are free to Prime members.",1402185600,2014-06-08

1.0,"This is what happens when a comedian burns out. Dunham's entire thing is his puppets, with which he insults his audience and gets away with it.  On a personal comedy-club level, this is acceptable. Once commercialized with music and fake laugh tracks, this show went to hell. In Dunham's case, since his entire show is based upon puppets, to come up with new material, you have to come up with new puppets. The scenarios that he has come up with...visiting real people and businesses and warping out obnoxiousness for humor's sake...is NOT funny. Let's not forget Dunham is JNew W*rld Ord*r and his denigration of and overt racism for the White Christian and Muslim races is nothing short of criminal!

1.0,"Was really looking forward to this as the premise mirrors my own life in so many ways, but oy, the writing is weak, the main character is a piece of wood (we're supposed to think he's deeply disturbed and divided through flashbacks of him as a kid protecting his older brother), but there's no vision of the turmoil inside Barry (Basam) except through his tepid American (blonde, of course) wife, who keeps pestering him and saying there's no joy in their life (well, why hang around so long then?).  So Barry/Basom clearly has issues to work on, and I liked the storyline, but there's no depth, it's all formulaic cartoon that was done much better in Syriana and other films on Arab potentates, the potential for political reform, good son vs. bad son, etc.  Bummer.

Like the last Titanic movie disaster.  I waste a lot of time watching movies, and this was very much of a waste of time.  The final seen of the monsters is some kind of land walking Octopus types with a lot of extra arms, which could not exist on land.  The Octopus type body is made only for a water environment and could not move on land.  And these monsters were not all that distinct.  The monsters do a lot of guttural and screeching sounds.  Very stupid.  At the end you have the two main actors staring at these monsters with mouth open wonderment.",1334448000,2012-04-15
3.0,"This season of SP isn't as solid as many of the others.  There are a few episodes I think are a little weak like ""Medicinal Fried Chicken,"" ""Poor and Stupid,"" ""Insheeption,"" and ""Creme Fraiche.""  But what the season may lack in consistency, it makes up for in WOW moments.  I don't think I've ever been as blown away watching an animated show than I was seeing the uncovering of the truth of Cartman's father on ""201.""  ""Mysterion Rises"" also gave me a ""Of course!  It's so obvious!"" moment.  This season also offers quite a few old school Looney Tunes cartoon references that brought back childhood memories.  Season 14 was good though not as consistently brilliant as past seasons.  I am reducing the score an extra star because of the egregious censoring of ""201""--one of the most exciting SP episodes ever.  What could Kyle and the others at the end possibly be saying to warrant the entire thing being bleeped out?  And the bleeping of every mention of Mohammad is very annoying and is a bit baffling considering his name was not bleeped at all in ""200.""  Why not bleep it on this DVD if it is so dangerous?  Still, I guess we are lucky that this episode is included at all since it is not available online and hasn't been aired on Comedy Central since.Disc 1:""Sexual Healing""--So clever.  Saying what a lot of people think went down in the Tiger Woods's household, but doing it in X-Box EA Sports form and then bringing in the sex addiction theme with Ben Roethlisberger, Bill Clinton, Charlie Sheen, etc, is just brilliant.""The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs""--The boys are disappointed by a supposed controversial book assigned in school (the one that ""made a guy shoot the king of hippies"" according to Cartman), so they write their own.  Afraid of getting in trouble, they credit the book to Butters who is elevated to genius for his masterpiece in sociopolitical commentary and uncontrolled vomiting.  It's funny how readers interpret the disgusting passages.  Gross.""Medicinal Fried Chicken""--KFCs are being replaced by medicinal cannabis stores.  Randy and his friends purposely get testicular cancer so they can partake.  This episode is overly silly with the men bouncing on their balls like hippity hops.  Meanwhile, Cartman resorts to the black market to get his KFC fix.""You Have 0 Friends""--Despite his resistance, Stan's friends sign him up with a Face Book account and he is deluged with demands from ""friends"".  Stan finds that deleting a FB profile is tougher than he thought.  Meanwhile, the always sympathetic Kyle befriends a lonely boy who has no friends and finds that his own FB stock falls as a result thanks to Eric ""Kramer"" Cartman.""200""--This episode and the sequel blew me away back when they first aired.  In this part, Tom Cruise and all the celebrities defamed in South Park get together and demand to see Mohammad, who is the only person they know susceptible to ridicule, so they can get his goo.  They then get competition from gingers.  In another storyline, Jennifer Lopez (a.k.a. Mitch Conner) gets Mr. Hat to admit to Cartman that there was a cover-up pertaining to the identity of his father.  A LOT of past characters show up in these episodes which is a real treat for long-time SP fans.Disc 2:""201""--The continuation of ""200"".  I will not give away the ending, but it blew me away when I saw it when it first aired.  I said, ""No Way!"" out loud even though I was watching it by myself.  Brilliant!  Controversy surrounds the ""I learned something today"" speeches at the end as Comedy Central decided to bleep them out.  They are still bleeped out on this DVD.  I thought it was done on purpose when I first saw it, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone were actually angry it was done that way and a text statement from them is included at the beginning of this episode.""Crippled Summer""--A hilarious take-off of the ""Intervention"" TV series featuring Towlie"" ""I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!...Oh, it IS Wednesday.""  Also, a Looney Tunes treatment is given to a camp for handicapped kids where Nathan (the steroid seller in ""Up the Down Steroid"") keeps trying to get revenge on popular Jimmy, but his plans keep backfiring on him thanks to a dopey sidekick.""Poor And Stupid""--Cartman thinks he can't fulfill his dream of being a great NASCAR driver because he is not poor and stupid.  He thus gives away all his money and eats Vagisil to impede his short-term memory.""It's A Jersey Thing""--South Park (as well as the eastern half of the country) is being invaded by New Jerseyites.  It gets so bad, they contact al-Qaeda for help.  In this episode, viewers find out Sheila Broflovski is from Jersey (big surprise, huh?) and her son Kyle was conceived there, meaning he is struck by the three J's, according to Cartman, Jerseyite, Jewish, Jinger.  Fans of ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" and ""Jersey Shore"" will appreciate this episode.""Insheeption""--This is a take-off on the TV series ""Hoarders"".  Those shows are often funny anyway in a pathetic way, but I don't think SP took advantage of the possibilities.  A sheep herder?  And the hoarding theme is replaced by the dream/memory sequence.  This episode is also taken from the film ""Inception"" (hence the title) and the College Humor parody of ""Inception"" (so much so, it lead to an apology from Parker and Stone).  Stan's mom sums up this episode very well: ""Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool."" On a side note, that bully who torments a young Mr. Mackey looks like the kid in ""Eight Is Enough.""Disc 3:""Coon 2: Hindsight""--The Coon and his super hero friends keep getting overshadowed by Captain Hindsight, ""the hero of the modern age,"" who only tells people what should have been done to prevent disasters after they've happened. When he becomes the hero of the Gulf oil spill, Cartman tries to recruit him by resorting to blackmail.  Meanwhile, BP's continuous drilling causes increasing horrors for the environment and humanity.  The other members of Coon and Friends are fed up with Cartman's violent, overbearing tactics and kick him out of the union.""Mysterion Rises""--In this episode, we find out the identity of Mysterion (if it wasn't known before) and his real power.  When I saw this part I was blown away, ""Of course!  It all makes sense now!""  Cartman joins forces with the evil Cthulhu to get back at his former ""friends.""  Mysterion tries to see if there is a connection between the Cult of Cthulhu and his power.  I like the parody of the Lebron James commercial.  The Cthulhu song is hilarious.""Coon Vs. Coon & Friends""--In this final installment of the three-parter, Cartman and Cthulhu banish Cartman's former friends to the Nightmare City of R'lyeh while they wreak havoc to make the world a better place...for Cartman.  Mysterion takes action to stop them but an unsuspected hero may be the one to save the day.  I like Cartman's comic book summary of the story where he pleads with his ""evil"" friends (he thinks he's the good guy, of course) to ""Go with Christ."" Cartman also does a parody of that cartoon where the little kitten kneads and curls up on the back of the bulldog.  I remember that cartoon from my kid days.""Creme Fraiche""--Randy becomes obsessed with cooking shows in a sexual way while his wife Sharon gets out her frustrations using the shake weight.  This episode is hardly believable--I mean cab fare wouldn't be a few coins LOL.",1307664000,2011-06-10
3.0,It could just be me.  I am not a fan of the documentary style films.  I thought the movie dragged a bit and the ending appeared rushed.,1403740800,2014-06-26
4.0,"My wife and I get tired of subtitlesyou can get so busy reading them that you miss too much of a movieif they're going to sell their movies over here in the U.S.A.then the least they can do is get it dubbed well in EnglishI've passed on at least 30 movies that look good simply because of the subtitleswhich should still be included on the DVD, but be limited to it because once you watched one with English then you might want to watch it again later with the subtitles to pick up on more nuancesFor those who say take it or leave it, stop and consider how much much was spent making this movie. These days, a lot of international films that include English dubbing do an excellent job with the dubbing. The subtitles many times leave out a LOT of the dialogue. Imo, the subtitles lessened the experience of the movie.The cost for QUALITY dubbing compared to the overall cost of the movie is insignificant.The avoided expense of quality dubbing in other languages especially English for US sales as we spend more on DVDs than any other country in the world, IS a reason to affect the rating of the movie. Other foreign films do it and do it quite well.Compared to what was spent on the rest of the movie making it, quality dubbing in English would only to the movie which is not just a rich visual experience but has more to it in the dialogue than you get with subtitles.For those who say stop and pause to read them....that's no way to experience a movie either. I want to relax and enjoy it as I bought it to watch in my own home.When you buy any product made in say Japan or China, the vendors take the time to include an English version in their printed instruction manuals. I'm saying the company selling this on DVD would sell more of them if they did the extra work.All they've done is digitize the movie and copy it onto a DVD with subtitles. Considering the price of this movie, they took the cheap route.I'm not just rating the movie but the product which is on DVD and is what I bought. It would have been a great value had it also had quality dubbing in English.Those who love the movie as is seem to have forgotten the fact they're actually buying more than just the screenplay, but the rest of the product as well.I add nothing here about the movie itself since others have already covered that.",1267228800,2010-02-27

5.0,"I didn't know what to expect with this remake, but I was totally impressed with the feel of it.  The casting was perfect!  The story was ""classic trek"" which should make any fan of the original television series more than pleased.  There were a few odd additions  (like the quirky relationship between Uhura and Spock, the fate of Spock's mother, and the ultimate demise of the Romulan villain) that didn't gel with what I remembered from the original, but hopefully if this remake kick-starts a new resurgence of sequels, these odd additions may evolve and/or be explained in later movies.Overall, this is an awesome remake amidst a dismal gallery of very bad ones in a variety of genres.  They got it so right... thank goodness!  Enjoy and of course, Live Long and Prosper!",1241827200,2009-05-09

I really enjoyed the &#34;his & hers side of the story&#34; format ... & how, after the verdict came down, the viewer was always let in on who actually committed the crime, irregardless of whether the jury got it right.  The only thing that was a bit irksome (as I did not find it plausible) was the sexual attraction of many of the male characters in the show to Kathryn Peale, who reminded me of an ex-nun, given her hair cut & dress.  I just didn't see it at all.",1402358400,2014-06-10
5.0,"I watched the first episode of &#34;Hannibal&#34; with the assumption that it would be a rather silly spin-off from the movies using the Hannibal Lechter character as a gimmick. I'm happy to say that I was wrong!First of all, the casting is excellent. I think Mads Mikkelsen is just as good as Anthony Hopkins in the role of Hannibal Lechter, and Hugh Dancy is a very good as Will Graham. Laurence Fishburne, Caroline Dhavernas, and the rest of the cast are also excellent.One of the things that make this show so good is the cinematography. Their amazing use of color and shadow is something I would normally expect to see in a feature film. The use of color is particularly striking, giving the show an almost painterly effect, with some scenes using rich, super-saturated outdoor light and others using a submarine palette of blues and greys and blacks. My only real complaint about the whole show is that they tend to over-use the high speed cloud scrolling shots, but that is just nitpicking. :)TV shows usually suffer from indifferent writing, but so far &#34;Hannibal&#34; has raised the bar. The plots are logical and consistent, with just the right mixture of action, drama, and personality. I haven't even noticed any major continuity flaws, which is very rare.To sum up, &#34;Hannibal&#34; was a pleasant surprise, despite its somewhat gruesome subject matter, and if they can keep this up I'll be very pleased!Oh, one other thing that struck me as funny is that the show has a culinary consultant. As an added bonus it is Jose Andres, one of my favorite chefs, though I may never watch him carve into anything quite the same way ever again. ;)",1368921600,2013-05-19
4.0,This series is just addictive. I saw the commercials for the second season not knowing that it was the second season.

His character's ok, but GEORGE steals the show. Kids will love the bright colors and uptempo pace of the show.

5.0,"This is an excellent series by any production standard BUT I can understand why they cancelled it after the first season. Not many stuck with it due to its complex story line and what seems to be ""oddball acting"" by an eccentric cast. The most vivacious role and best acting was by his inadvertent (and gorgeous) neighbor. Rubicon requires watching carefully and hanging in there to piece it together just like the characters in are doing as their job assignments unfold, but there is no wham-BAM, snap, crackle, and PoP. One suspenseful interval but the rest rather bland and dull cerebral ""ah-ha's"" which are gratifying to a minority of viewers. Even the office politics are predictable and transparent. ""Three Days of the Condor"" was the ultimate conspiracy story as it had pulse and urgency and suspense, and excitement to it. Rubicon is a poignant illumination of pure greed for corporate power and wealth with the the US Government as their lackey. If you like patiently sorting out the chaos to attain clarity then this is highly recommended. After the last episode it is definitely too bad this will not be continued, but it left us all just where it was supposed to - understanding the true significance of the 4 leaf clover, wondering about the fates of Miles (and Julia), Ingram, Will, and Maggie as well as knowing the fate of Spangler, for without him there is no crossword puzzle and lamenting for David, Tom, and Katherine. Stick with it, its worth it!",1392076800,2014-02-11
4.0,"I liked the look of this one while it had it's run, wish it had lasted longer. The &#34;look&#34; of the series was always very good and the writing seemed pretty good too. Similar to Joss Whedons' &#34;Dollhouse&#34; in that the character &#34;Edward&#34; has a dual identity as &#34;Henry&#34; imprinted in his mind, activated when he's off duty. I was never really sure who, or what Edward worked for- some shadowy Government, or private, agency?- but the stories were interesting and always had a good look to them.Christian Slater did a good job portraying dual roles as Edward and Henry, I'd have loved to see how that one would've worked out. Judging by my memory, and the air dates Amazon lists, NBC didn't give the series a lot of respect- they certainly cancelled it quickly. Probably had too big a budget and wasn't an instant ratings success.I've rewatched episodes 1-6 & 9, all good. The first 6 at least have a young Taylor Lautner in them (the packaging makes a point of emphasizing &#34;Twilight&#34;) he's good but miscast as he doesn't look anything like the rest of his &#34;family&#34;.Even if you don't like My own worst enemy it's still better than most of the trash out there.",1355702400,2012-12-17

5.0,"Perfection, NV: A tiny western town of dust, sand... and giant carnivorous graboids burrowing underground.And after three movies of battling the graboids, shriekers and ass-blasters, fans of the ""Tremors"" series finally got a (tragically short-lived) TV spinoff. ""Tremors: The Complete Series"" takes everything fun about the movies tacks in some conspiracies and freaky mutants -- there are a few mildly grating characters, but it's still deliciously fun and strange.A new guy named Tyler Reed (Victor Browne) rolls into Perfection, intending to take over the Desert Jack Graboid Tours... just in time for El Blanco to go on a berserk feeding frenzy.It isn't the last graboid-related problem -- Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the other Perfectionites must deal with a gourmet assblaster, a scientist training shriekers to be rescue animals, a graboid attacking a town of UFO-fanatics, graboid-rights activists who claim the Perfectionites are killing El Blanco, and a pair of mob thugs who run afoul of El Blanco and lost a very important key.And pretty soon there are even worse problems. Burt finds that a strange substance called MixMaster, leaked out of a secret laboratory, begins to infect the valley and turns the creatures into bizarre hybrids -- giant shrimps, omnivorous termite/maggots, a mineshaft ""ghost,"" or an acid-spitting reptilian plant.""Tremors: The Complete Series"" was cancelled after only thirteen episodes, but those episodes are brilliant from beginning to end. And they have everything you'd expect from a Tremors series -- lots of big guns, explosions, orange goop, and highly imaginative ways to kill various monsters (including with weather balloons and tar).For the record: the MixMaster, the secret lab and the eccentric old scientist all seem rather hokey, but soon they mesh nicely into the existing ""Tremors"" mythology. Think a funnier, lighter ""X-Files"" vibe. And the writers do an excellent job, weaving clever plots with plenty of action, a bit of tragedy (Cletus and Project 4-12), and lots of hilarious dry humor, especially regarding Burt (""Somebody get up on the wrong side of the bunker today?"").Gross is, as always, brilliant as the endearing survivalist Burt -- he has to start a survival school, wrangle with a hard-headed government rep, and deal with a town of hostile UFO-fanatics. Browne is decent as the new ""everyman lead,"" and there are some solid supporting performances by Lela Lee, Marcia Strassman, Sarah Rafferty, and especially Christopher Lloyd as a wonderfully eccentric scientist-turned-desert-hermit.Two of the cast aren't quite as endearing -- J.D. Walsh's pushy ubernerd just ends up being annoying. And Gladys Jimenez's Rosalita is a fun character (an ex-showgirl with a shady history) but sometimes it feels like she's there to run around in filmy shirts.""Tremors: The Complete Series"" has a couple bumps in the road, but overall it's a brilliant spinoff to the classic B-movie series. A must-see... or if you're a graboid, a must-eat.",1265155200,2010-02-03
1.0,HIMYM should have ended their run around season 6. Once Marshall's dad died the season became too serious for it's own good and stopped being a comedy and tried to rely more heavily on the dramedy side of the show - they should have stuck to being more closely related to a sitcom than dramedy.

5.0,"Mad Men was never a great show and all the accolades are nonsense but it is compulsive viewing. That is the way with soaps and really the show degenerated into soap way back in season 2. The casting has been good and the character of Don Draper has emerged as a triumphant failure. I liked the theme of alcoholics which has always been a borderline concern in the advertising industry (and still is). With the arrival of the great IBM computer we are seeing the start of the great change which occurred in the industry. Modern day advertising is nothing like the Mad Men series and is all about data analysis. So there are no Don Drapers or sexist romps on the office floor. Parts of the show are bad beyond bad, and the character of Peggy `unlikely' and a writers nightmare; one of those characters who will just not go away. In a sea of humdrum no-body's and dead-end subplots, the soap scum is thick on the surface and we are now (in season 7) asked to remember ill-defined non-entities from season 2. Really writers, don't panic, it will mercifully soon be all over.",1400025600,2014-05-14

5.0,"This was a very good episode. It was mostly focused on the Don/Sally relationship. Its somewhat a step on a long road toward honesty on both sides. Sally has rather unexpectedly (at least to me) become perhaps the one person Don can be honest with and be himself with. There is lots of interesting ways that could develop during the remainder of the series. It grows out of the basic point made in season six. That nearly all the people around Don don't want honesty or the real thing.Sally walking into the office and finding Don gone followed in a long series of Sally ""disappointment"" moments in the series. But how it evolved and Don reached out to her honestly this time made it both different and very meaningful. Don's motivation for his personal paralysis being revealed as a desire to somehow ""fix things"" was also good. I enjoyed the bits where Don just can't escape the business down to wanting to know seating arrangements in meetings.On the not so good side, dragging Pete back into more GM stories doesn't seem interesting. They need to find something for Peggy to do in story terms other than being angry and frustrated. I'm also not so sure that a partner in a firm with the title ""head of personnel"" would be an inferior downstairs position compared to someone in accounts. The pullback in Pete's appearance and behavior from the first episode was a bit odd as well.",1398038400,2014-04-21

Let me tell you this is one of the funniest, well acted, goofy, and hilarious shows (football or otherwise) that I have seen in a very long time.  From the funeral scene to the monkey high on cocaine shooting a gun was just brilliant writing.  However the story isn't enough.  The story of the late owners wife taking over the football team and deciding to keep it instead of selling it is OK and has been done before but not like this.  The chemistry and delivery of the actor's punchlines are spot on and there is never a drop off.  If you haven't seen this show's pilot yet then you need to! I hope that this is one of the shows that is picked up for a full season with the same writers, actors and same delivery as the pilot.",1394064000,2014-03-06
5.0,"This is the best sitcom I have experienced in years. Witty, smart, two women, with a cast of more young women! It is a gas.I watched most of the first season on Prime for free. I was shocked to see that the last 6 shows were suddenly a $1.99 a piece!I am 62, retired so that price shot that experience out of the water. I am disappointed that Amazon handled the series this way. You are watching prime for a reason. $1.99 a show is ruinous.I hope I get to see the rest of this series. It has put a sour taste in my mouth for Amazon Prime TV. Which I am sure I more than pay for by shopping through Amazon almost exculusively. I could find no where to get this complaint out in customer service.That is why I aired it here.",1361145600,2013-02-18
5.0,I am very happy that the writers have not just caved in and wrapped up everything in a nice little box each week.  The acting is getting better as you see them switch emotions in the middle of a scene to complete the overall arc.,1396656000,2014-04-05
3.0,"Jonathan Harker (Unax Ugalde) is employed by our old friend Count Dracula (Thomas Kretschmann) that has taken many forms in countless movies. The job is to catalog a library that any book lover would lust after.Little did Jonathan know that the count had ulterior motives and a design on Jonathan's wife, Nina (Marta Gastini.) Mean time back at the ranch (Oops village) local peasant girl Tanja (Miriam Giovanelli) who likes to show off her birthday suit becomes vampire chow and soon joins the undead. She's not bad looking but all we remember are her fangs that stand out from the rest of her accoutrements.We get a few more looks at the library of leather bound books and what is that on Nina's dress? No not blood but ink. Is it significant?People are being dispatched right the left. ""Who you gonna call?"" Yep it's Abraham Van Helsing himself (Rutger Hauer at 69 years old.) He is protected because he is a ""cross"" dresser. This gets the ex Lucy Kisslinger (Asia Argento) all ""fired"" up.Who will win in this eternal fight? Probably the person that rented the film instead of buying it.Be sure to watch the DVD extras to ad a dimension to the viewing experience.

5.0,"I thoroughly enjoy &#34;Parenthood&#34;.  The family deals with so many issues, the least of which is the size of it and the emotional closeness of it's members.  Sounds like a cliche, but &#34;I laughed; I cried!&#34;.  It is wonderful, with a superb ensemble cast and crack writing.  It is upbeat, but not sugar-coated.

I liked the first episode well enough to give it another couple of episodes before I decided one way or the other if I truly liked it.  So, long story short-this is the 17th episode and I am still watching it, love the characters and am giving it 5 stars.  I hope it gets picked up for a second season and I will be buying every episode of the second season plus the dvd for this season regardless of whether cwtv continues it or not.

Add to that the constant battle for respect by a woman in a traditionally &#34;men's club&#34; position of authority.  The story lines are realistic & DI Tennison tenaciously tracks down the murderer, in spite of her superiors, uncooperative subordinates & personal issues.Overall, this series is exceptionally well done.",1401235200,2014-05-28

3.0,"Another of the History Channel's increasing roster of infotainment programs, ""America's Book of Secrets"" is one that is decidedly hit or miss.  Playing up speculation, myth, and even scandal, the show aims to be somewhat provocative but, more often the not, comes across as a bit silly.  I mean, really, there is an episode about the Playboy Mansion!  I certainly don't have anything against Hef and the girls, but the episode seems ill-fitting at best and completely overblown at worst.  And for a show that promises secrets, many of the episodes offer very little new material (especially if you have a pre-existing interest in and knowledge of the topic).  Instead of straightforward profiles, in most cases the show attempts to sensationalize its subjects.  So we've got myth and speculation, conspiracy theories, and factual specifics all wrapped up in a docuseries that is overflowing with self importance.  If you watch History Channel offerings with frequency, you'll know what I mean.  Even the most mundane declarations are stated in such an overheated way!  It can be off-putting to new viewers, but it's something that has provided much amusement in my life.I'm not trying to discourage anyone from sampling ""America's Book of Secrets"" as it might appeal to those that love the National Treasure films or Dan Brown books or Brad Meltzer's Decoded.  I'm just trying to set appropriate expectations for new viewers of History fare.  The program is fun enough, but it works much better as entertainment (to my mind) than as a source of real information.DVD Specifics:  The set features the ten episodes of Season One plus the Bonus Special that launched the entire enterprise (let's just call it eleven episodes for the sake of ease) spread over 3 discs.  Each show clocks in at around 47 minutes so you're getting roughly 8.5 hours of material including the added bonus show.  The DVD has English and Spanish subtitle options.Episodes:(1) The White House, (2) Free Masons, (3) Fort Knox, (4) Area 51, (5) The Playboy Mansion, (6) Presidential Transports, (7) The FBI, (8) West Point, (9) Black Ops, and (10) The Pentagon.Bonus Episode: The MonumentsIf you are completely unfamiliar with the History series format, I might suggest sampling an episode (they repeat with frequency) before making the full investment.  My guess, this will either really appeal to you or it will really not.  While I enjoyed some of the episodes more than others, the series never really qualified as must-see destination television for me.  KGHarris, 9/12.",1346544000,2012-09-02
3.0,Slow pace. Not a very interesting story line. Dark and hard to see. I don't think that it's something that I will go back to or recommend.Plus I think it's a little late to the &#34;Vampire&#34; party. Feels like a dance that's dying out.,1383523200,2013-11-04

4.0,"This is a strange amalgam of horror, SciFi and stoner comedy that for some reason worked for me. It is a bit confusing at first but soon becomes a fun romp through a depressing small town landscape. Drugs are a bit part of the story, so be forewarned (you will never look at soy sauce the same way again). There is also some gratuitous nudity, which somehow fits with the film's ambiance. The acting was serviceable and a pair of recognizable stars have small parts, lending the whole enterprise an air of legitimacy. All in all, I rather liked it, which sort of makes me uneasy.",1384905600,2013-11-20

4.0,"Interesting show to watch, but too far fetched for me. I highly doubt that a man who is suffering from active schizophrenia (evident with hallucinations, if not delisions) & is not on medication, would be able to function as a college professor, let alone work with the FBI.  HOWEVER...The show is well organized &, again, interesting to watch. I enjoy the depictions of the main character receiving guidance or counsel from his hallucinations. Also, persons who suffer with schizophrenia do tend to be of high intelligence; so, I appreciate portrayal of the way the main character can solve puzzles that are meaningless to others.--Definitely worth watching!!",1360022400,2013-02-05

4.0,"The &#34;bad guy&#34; in this show is as much the people running the research station in Antarctica as the virus and genetic code that the virus is carrying.

5.0,"Johnny Lee Miller's portrayal is so endearing: his Sherlock is damaged and quirky, without the overpowering condescension we seen in the British TV version. The storyline is genius: Watson = female sober-companion, and subtly played by Lucy Liu - whose character has her own damage-stuff going in. The cases are interesting. Aiden Quinn is lovely in his role - he always brings such gravitas. It's a GREAT show.",1360281600,2013-02-08

The encounters between dedicated doctors and especially nurses and their mostly poor patients occur before any system of socialized medicine and at a time when several medical conditions---pregancy, attempted suicide---brought with them not only much social baggage but also the threat of police intervention. Many of the scenes are tense and several quite difficult to watch. The grimness is offset by the comfort we can derive from the spectacular advances in moderm medicine in developed countries...yet &#34;London Hospital&#34; also conveys the feel of emergency services in developing countries today.",1365033600,2013-04-04

5.0,"Thank goodness there are no zombies, walking dead, vampires or other supernatural creatures in this series. There also isn't much blood (even though it is typically violent, given the whole story line). I wouldn't recommend it for elementary-aged kids due to subject matter, sex, violence but I have found the story line to be incredibly gripping. There are great twists that keep the story interesting- I can't believe how many of the important characters they kill off (or at least, it seems like they get killed&#8230; who knows for sure) so you are never quite sure who is &#34;safe&#34; from disappearing from the story. Costuming and set  details are pretty amazing. I'm really enjoying this venture in sci-fi after many years away because it was just too outlandish and crazy.",1399939200,2014-05-13
4.0,"I cannot say that Almost human has never been done before, nor could I tell you that the notion of human and android working together is new, but, the cast and contrast between the two is done to perfection. The plots are interesting and definitively hold ones attention. It's an interesting contrast to see Karl Urban, after seeing him in the movie Red with Bruce Willis, and then as Dr McCoy in the new Star Trek movies, now to bring what is essentially the same type of character, the hard ass veteran yet still humorous cop, a role he plays so very well, to the small screen. And although the premise of the show is also not new, the good cop betrayed, yet somehow now with the help of and equally flawed android as a partner, he is now able to rebuild his broken life and career, which as you will find are pretty much one in the same thing. The show is well worth the effort to watch, and quite enjoyable. This show is greatly Recommended",1389398400,2014-01-11

5.0,"Season 1- Monk is a hilarious and an incredibly entertaining series. Three years earlier, Adrian Monk's wife, Trudy was murdered by a car bomb. He has extreme O.C.D. and relies on his Nurse/Assistant Sharona to help him while he solves murders with Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, and Lt. Randy Disher. Throughout the season Monk investigates an assassination attempt on a Mayoral Candidate, goes to an asylum, takes a vacation, deals with an earthquake, helps prove the innocence of Willie Nelson, and much more.Season 2- Monk's 2nd is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous season, perhaps even better. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his Assistant, Sharona. Throughout this season Monk investigates a murder at Trudy's high school, goes to Mexico, help prove the innocence of Sharona's sister during a stage play, figure out why a paperboy is killed for the newspaper, gets married, goes to jail, and finally gets a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 3- This is probably my favorite season. During the course of this season, we say good-bye to Sharona Fleming and hello to Natalie Teeger. Monk investigates Warrick Tennyson's role in Trudy's murder, gets fired, helps an organized crime family, becomes a contestant on a game show, gets stuck in traffic, goes to Las Vegas, adopts a kid, and much more.Season 4- Throughout this season Monk returns home on HALLOWEEN, stays in bed because he's sick, gets drunk, goes to a fashion show, figure out who would want to poison Stottlemeyer at the Christmas party, gets amnesia, stop a killer astronaut, and figure out if Trudy Monk had faked her death.Season 5- Throughout this season Monk deals with a garbage strike, loses his eyesight, attends his college reunion, goes to a rock concert, finally meets his dad, goes on the air, and much more.Season 6- Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 7- Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died. Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player, helps a boxer, gets stuck on a submarine underwater, meets his other brother, fights City Hall, and much more.The Final Season- In the end, all the pieces will fit together. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy. It all comes down to this. This season felt a little rushed, but is the perfect ending to the Monk saga. I highly recommend MONK: THE COMPLETE SERIES!!!",1322524800,2011-11-29

Indeed, after changing a roommate after the initial episode, the series had an uneasy start with its humor feeling forced. What was obvious is that they were not able to capitalize frm the start on what would become the strength of the series: the irritating cute charm of the star theyy had in deschanel. Indeed the first episodes ( and I mean all of the first DVD) are unfunny and forced and make you want to cringe.

3.0,"The question is ""Did We Really Need to Rebuild Her?"" After watch all eight episodes of this Bionic Woman remake, I say NO!This last TV season NBC choose to remake the Bionic Woman for the 2000's. In trying to gain success like Sci-Fi Channel had the other 1970's remake  Battlestar Galactica, The producers took a gritter style...and It failed on many levels.As lovely as Michelle Ryan is, she is NO Lindsay Wagner. Ms Ryan tries to give this piece heart. The Character , a bartender , is given her bionics after an auto accident with her Government surgeon boyfriend.  She is saddled her with a felony kid sister (Lucy Hale) who was dumped on her when their father disappeared. Ryan is one of the reason's to watch this show.However, the heart of the show is buried deep within sub plots of the previous sort of Evilish bionic woman Sarah (Katee Sackhoff from the remake Of Gallatica) and ideas of double crossing people that seemed to be ripped off from old ALIAS plots. This new Woman is told is a soap opera form, which weaken this piece.The highlight of the show after Ryan  is Miguel Ferrer as the mysterious  Jonas. He plays a tough as nails agency boss, better than Richard Anderson ever played Oscar Goldman. His stone cold demeanor works well in this character, better than he did in Crossing Jordan (which season one is coming on DVD soon)The funnest thing about this new Bionic Woman. She  has $50,000 dollars worth of bionics parts, up from the 1970's amount of six million..inflation, inflation, inflation!I am sadden that only eight episodes (which are all presented here) were made of this series before the writer's strike of TV season 2007-2008. It had promise, but we may never know if it could have developed. NBC Network  has not stated if this show has been renewed for the next season. So these eight episodes may be the only  episodes of this seriesI can only wish that someone would release the classic Six Million Dollar man or the original Bionic woman on DVD...Now that was great television!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",1208304000,2008-04-16
4.0,"I didn't expect to like this series as much as I did. I generally find Agatha Christie a little simple-minded but this has been the perfect antidote to a stressful summer. David Suchet makes a perfect Poirot, the supporting cast are delightful but it's the sets and costumes that leave me gaga. I adore art deco and the architecture, furniture, costumes, cars and product designs in this series are a feast for the eyes. Very enjoyable.",1376352000,2013-08-13

The series does get some historical details right, and there may be facts which have been fudged up. The performances are first-rate, and the costumes and sets have been well-done.Be Warned: Contains graphic violence, female/male nudity & sexuality (in some episodes) and modern/Roman swear words.",1391990400,2014-02-10

4.0,"Season 3 of Being Human (US) is my favorite and hits its pace as a show with a fully developed set of characters and story line.  With 13 episode seasons, character development has become a part of jumping on in on a moving story for all shows in which we have 13 episodes to know the characters, like/dislike them, and get vested in the story.  It took me a while but by season 3 I've settled into the mix of odd characters trying to live normal lives even though they are far from it.  They have solidified as a cast of characters that have bonded through joining together to help each out enough now that the them against the world theme sticks and allows for more humor to slip in as they get caught in some situations that could only be funny in the context of this show.  At this point I am hooked and am pulling for each of the characters and enjoy the show in how each supports each other in a unique way as they fail their way to figuring out how to make the odd situation they have put themselves in work.  It doesn't really, but that is what makes it interesting as they struggle through their attempts to be normal though they are far from it.  It took a while for it to all come together but season 3 achieves what was attempted all along as this group of misfit friends figure out how to live in the world and somehow get by even though they miss work half the time and are constantly pulling each other out of unique problems only a this group of monsters could be in.  Unique entertainment in an area of with a lot of competition but none like Being Human achieves!",1404950400,2014-07-10
1.0,"Now, I'm going to admit I thought the show was pretty funny when it first came on. But midway through the fist season, the child actors started to get on my nerves, they wernt acting like kids, they were acting like snotty adults. I stopped watching for a while, then I caught a couple reruns on USA Network, the new baby is just awful and annoying. And one thing that bothers me is that they completely ignore the cameras. I know they aren't suppose to act like the cameras are around in a documentary, but its not like a movie theater will allow a camera crew in a movie theater with copyrighted stuff in it? just come on",1371340800,2013-06-16

5.0,"I do not watch much on Syfy.  Maybe one show.  I read that this was a show to check out this year.  So, I FIOSED it.  WOW!  I have a list of shows that after seeing the first episode, I wanted to see the entire season.  This show is now on that list.  Some said it was cheap or not well done.  I would have to 100% disagree.  Everything that I saw looked great.  Back when I tried the Marvel show, I felt like it was cheap.  Everything looked fake or painted.  But the way they make this show is very high class.  I got so into the story.  I want to see and find out so much more.  Good job Syfy.  Here is to a series that lasts for 10 seasons.  I will pre order this when I can.  Great, interesting show with great actors who all do a fantastic job.Oh, to some who said it's a zombie show.  That doesn't give it enough credit.  This feels like nothing I have ever seen.  I am a huge fan of The Walking Dead.  I have seen every episode.  But again, this feels different.  It seems like a cross between The X files and Outbreak.

5.0,"I watched the &#34;Under the Dome&#34; pilot before I knew this was based on a Stephen King book. I am now hooked on the show. I want to know what happens to these people and to find out who is going to survive. Not having known this was based on an existing book, I have no pre-conceived notions of what is suppose to happen, and I am enjoying the episodes so far. I look forward to the email that tells me a new episode is available to watch. Once I found out this was based on a Stephen King book, and that he was involved with the show, I was surprised since I like this show. I am not a Stephen King fan. I read a couple of his books and was bored with the last one I started to read...there was too much build-up and not enough action. I gave up and passed the book along to a friend, who was thrilled to read it. It just wasn't for me. I know there are a lot of people who love his work. My tastes in reading are elsewhere.

5.0,"""Rome"" is my personal favorite miniseries ever.  It has a gritty authenticity that transports the viewer to the Rome of Julius Caesar's time.  The acting is first rate, the storylines are terrific, there is very little not to like about this miniseries.  My favorite aspect of this series is the friendship that develops between Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson).  The character study of the differences between these two men is really fascinating.""The Stolen Eagle"" is the first episode of the miniseries and one of the best.  Julius Caesar concludes his war in Gaul and must now confront the Senate over his future.  Well, we all know what happens next, but this episode and series make it suspenseful nontheless.Highly recommended.  RJB.",1327536000,2012-01-26

4.0,"I am recommending all of season 5 of this series, not just one episode.Denis Leary's enflamed New York city firefighter Tommy Gavin is back. I find Tommy Gavin an interesting character but at times it is frustrating that nothing of Denis Leary the stand-up comic with the zingers at the ready and the educated man (MFA from Emerson college) shows through. I suppose this shows Leary's commitment to Gavin as a character.Perhaps more than any other factor, what shows in this season is Gavin as a substance abuser, an alcoholic. He is in AA and he is out of AA. He fights with the priest constantly about their problems with alcohol. The other firemen open a bar and he gets involved with it and drinking there. His girlfriend allows him to drink but his wife does not. An unrecognizable Michael J. Fox does a brilliant job of playing Gavin's wife's new boyfriend who is wheelchair bound. He and Gavin briefly bond as maimed characters on just about every level, including substance abuse. It's hard to upstage Leary but Fox manages it. I was sad that Fox did not become a permanent character on the series but I suppose he was not interested in doing tv long term. Maybe they can bring him back next season for a few episodes as well since he was not killed off.Gavin the firefighter is also on considerable display in this season. Perhaps his inability to conquer his inner demons is what makes him courage personified with rescuing people in burning buildings. He can even cope with burned bodies which other firemen can't face without becoming ill.The least satisfying aspect of this series is Gavin's continuing problems with his girlfriend and his wife and the other few women who briefly alight in his life. I can't stand either the wife or the girlfriend as characters and would be happy if somehow they were eliminated from this series. I wish they would bring back Tatum O'Neal more, Gavin's sister. At least she was a female character with whom we could sustain interest.Of the other firefighters, Sean is the most interesting one in this season because he gets cancer (probably from 9/11 exposure) but must get surgery on the sly because he wants to remain in the fire department as a fighting fireman. We also discover that Sean can SING in some very imaginative dream sequences while he is unconscious. Kenny wants to marry a prostitute and the Chief is married to a promiscuous woman he brought over from Russia. This seems very strange to me and I have no idea if this bears any relationship to what choices real firefighters would make as to women to marry. That they are able to convince themselves that they can reform these women is black comedy.",1250553600,2009-08-18

5.0,"""The Tudors"" is unlike any television show ever broadcast. The series is wonderfully produced with a huge budget, the acting is worthy of Oscars, and the story, although told before, is presented here fresh and is excitingly original. This 10 episode series dramatizes the life of King Henry VIII of England and his attemmpts to have a male heir for his dynasty as well as the international problems that beset him. The first season details the King's attempts to divorce his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and his lust for Anne Boleyn. The series is racy with many explicit sex scenes, but what makes ""The Tudors"" work are its strong scripts and the acting by its leads, most notably Jonathan Rhys Meyers who portrays Henry not only as a hungry sexual predator, but a man who loves his country and his people. The series won many Emmy nominations, most notably one for Meyers, for his soaring portrayal. ""The Tudors"" is beautifully produced, with amazing costumes and sets that add to the lustre of the series. In all four seasons worth of episodes will been made with seasons 2 and 3 available on DVD (season 3 comes out on DVD in early 2010).",1258934400,2009-11-23

5.0,"This is an absorbing series set in Nashville which provides a nice change from East/West coast dramas. Whoever cast the show deserves a bonus. The actors are really good from the stars to the smaller parts.  And, in a tribute to Nashville, the music is also terrific. It actually adds rather than distracts from the various plot lines, a balance which can be difficult to master. There are several intersecting story lines which concern people struggling for success in the music business, in politics,, and the effect of celebrity on the personal lives of people in those arenas.  The plots are not predictable with interesting twists in almost every episode.Hayden Panettiere was a particular surprise to me as she has some real acting chops in a role which might have been reduced to eye candy with a lesser performer.I have watched all the episodes online but the series is so good that I am purchasing the DVD.",1355356800,2012-12-13

Everyone now must have a personal ID card in order to buy anything, get transportation or enter any where, including your own home.  He meets his brother's wife and is instantly attracted to her.  What follows is a story of intrigue and conspiracies that keeps you guessing as to who the good guys and the bad guys are.

She plays the &#34;bad guy&#34; very well: spying, seducing, and brutally murdering for the Russians while maintaining her cover as an innocuous American housewife.The premise of the show is that the Soviet Union planted long term agents in the US who are more American than real Americans. The plots unfold in the early 80's during the Reagan administration with flashbacks to fill in the backstories of Russell's character and that of her pretend husband played by Matthew Rhys. There's plenty of intrigue, sex, killings and suspense to make this show a worthy spy thriller. Some people also like looking for anachronisms in the settings and details of the time period.",1367107200,2013-04-28

5.0,"O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here's Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there's no slack off at all from season one's most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television's most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There's a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn't keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth's: ""Keep talking. I'll catch up."" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season's newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan's new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we're hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother's unsolved murder and her father's disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are ""The Truth in the Lye"" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: ""Even for me, this is disgusting.""), ""The Woman in the Sand"" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), ""Aliens in a Spaceship"" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking ""The Blonde in the Game"" and its equally harrowing follow-up ""The Man in the Cell"" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season's ""A Man on Death Row"") and the season-ender ""Stargazer in the Puddle"" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on ""The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"" (with Emily Deschanel) and on ""Stargazer in a Puddle."" Boreanaz doesn't commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers ""The Memories in the Season"" featurette; ""Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones"" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on ""The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there'll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts).",1190073600,2007-09-18

I thought Lindsey Lohan would be right for the role, although she played it without class and style. Oh, they did get the contacts right. I kept waiting for that moment to tie the film together, to make everything I was watching on the screen suddenly become meaningful. It didn't happen.

Given a $10,000 budget and 2 days to remodel a restaurant is not enough to create designs of lasting quality.

Well, Touching Evil makes Wallender look like walk in the park so be advised. It is very dark with almost no lighter moments and each following episode after the first seems to get darker. I'll not give away any details but be prepared. You'll enjoy the series (make that &#34;become enthralled&#34; because &#34;enjoy&#34; just isn't the right word) like a book you can't put down.

Part of the reason I love this show is, one never really knows where the plot is going to twist-but twist it will!!",1381449600,2013-10-11
3.0,"I didn't hate this one, don't get me wrong, it's still miles from being good, but the lead character has potential. Nice to see Malcolm McDowell and Bernadette Peters acting, and though I'm not a huge fan of Saffron Burrows, there was just enough of her without triggering the usual boredom sensation I get when she's on screen. Everyone else was meh, except the new conductor who was a one dimensional black hole of comedy. If this gets picked up, consider revising the character.",1391817600,2014-02-08
5.0,"The Amazing Race has you on the edge of your seat, even if you've seen the season before, anticipating who's going to come in first on each leg, anticipating who's going to come in last on each leg, whether this is an elimination leg or not. My favorite parts of the series are when several teams think they're in last place, when, in fact, only one team is. The various tasks that the contestants perform are very interesting. Some of them remind me of Survivor tasks, only these are done all over the world. It's surprising who is good at the tasks and who is not. You can't anticipate who's going to take the lead on a certain task.",1373155200,2013-07-07

5.0,"I have to say so far this is the movie of the year for me. The second movie of the year will more than likely be ""The Scribbler"" with Katy Cassidy.  This movie was so artistically done and the cinematography was so beautiful. It reminded me of a cross between a David Lynch film and some of David Cronenberg's older material. The first half of the movie was basically her having zero morality for mankind even children. The second half of the film she becomes depressed and doesn't understand what her place is on this earth. She also finds a respect for human life and tries to live like us. Even tries to mate with our kind and finds she doesn't have the reproductive organ for it. From there she becomes even more depressed and tries to find solace alone.The seduction scenes are out of this world very David lynch as well as the opening sequence. I don't want to give away plot details for the film. But for those that are in to the indie art cinema this one is for you. The nude sequences are shot beautifully and tastefully. The film is pretty much a silent film with very little dialogue with little explanation. But the movie itself for the most part is pretty self explanatory for someone that is use to these types of films. I will be purchasing this film on bluray with no hesitation. This and Matchpoint , Vickie Christina Barcelona would probably be scarlet's three best films. But this one hands down is her most experimental and challenging role. If you like this film check out Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr, Lost river, Inland Empire, Excision and AntiChrist you won't be disappointed.",1401667200,2014-06-02
2.0,"Potentially this is a great series, but after a few episodes I felt it wasn't getting anywhere. There seems to be a lack of intensity, with story lines that just drift off.

However, the concept is fascinating and the acting is excellent.",1391472000,2014-02-04

David Tennant's interpretation of the 10th Doctor is superb.  He is great fun to watch.  If you are not sure about this season, give this episode a try ... you won't be sorry!",1309737600,2011-07-04
5.0,"This show is absolutely ground breaking. I have to say that I find some of these genius children junior chef's are better than some of the chef's I have seen on the original MasterChef. The chemistry between the Judges and the children is outstanding. The children all encourage each other and that is just wonderful to see. In the first episode, the children are broken up into groups. Some make it through, and some don't in each group. These dishes from the savory, to the most complex of sweet dishes is something I have never seen. Some of these children put up Gordon Ramsay Restaurant type of food. I love how the judges always have something positive to say to the children even if they have to give constructive advice on how to improve their dishes. Joe even compared one youngster's sweet dish as a lesson for life. He said to the boy ""life does not always go your way does it?""  ""So what do you do when it doesn't?""  and the young boy said ""you find a way to fix it"".  Joe said ""right, you improvise. And that is what you have done here. Great Job!."" It was a great moment and the interaction with all of them is just heart warming as it is intense and competitive.  They are making real, restaurant quality dishes.  Make no mistake about this. This is real as it gets!  They are not making French toast in the toaster oven.They are utilizing the Masterchef kitchen and in many cases doing a better job then many adults that have come through those doors.  It is ground breaking to me because they are getting these children from ages 10 to 13 and placing them in a situation with pressure, and time limits to create these amazing dishes.  I wont go into what they made. I want everyone to see it and enjoy the surprise of how sophisticated these dishes are.  I have trouble getting my daughter to do her homework?  How on earth these youngsters can create artistic dishes like these is just beyond my comprehension. The judges all joke around, but are serious when they have to be. They make it fun even with the pressure of having to compete. And never do the judges ever say anything that is negative. It is all great stuff with some idea's to help them. I think this journey they are taking is worth watching for the whole family.  I am even hoping it might inspire my daughter to want to try something new and have the confidence to do it.  There are thousands of reasons to watch. I cant think of one not to.....I say try it, and enjoy it....You cant go wrong in just trying it. But I believe you will be hooked just as I am. This is even more fun then the original Masterchef.  They really created something unique, new, and original for television that we have never seen before. Lastly, its not the judges who you are tuning in for.  They have made the children the stars of this show. It is just brilliantly done. And just good fun. 5 stars all the way......",1380326400,2013-09-28

3.0,"When the new girl in school starts to come between Rebecca and her best friend, Lucy, she begins to suspect that there is something far more sinister behind their relationship. Rachel Klein's modern update on traditional Gothic storytelling is brought to life in Mary Harron's screen adaptation of THE MOTH DIARIES, from 2011. Rebecca and the other girls transpose their teenage anxieties like anorexia, depression, suicide, and sexuality on to their ghostly classmate as a means of dealing with their internal struggles. While Ernessa may not be seen physically drawing the blood from her victims, her presence at the school certainly saps the other girls of their strength and happiness, leading them in to despair. The lesbianic undertones that are present in the plot also draw strongly from the classic tale of Carmilla, which is frequently referenced throughout the girls' schoolwork. Harron takes a timely approach in developing the characters and mood of the picture, but unfortunately, her deliberate pacing begins to wear during the long periods of inaction and leaves the audience feeling deprived as the film draws to its anticlimactic ending. Still, we are left on a positive note, having grown with Rebecca as she overcomes her pain and loss to find a renewed strength in herself. THE MOTH DIARIES ultimately falls short of becoming a modern classic, but it does provide another unique and emotionally charged vampire tale in the same vein as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",1359590400,2013-01-31
2.0,"The Castle character is still all about himself with no concern for endangering Beckett's career with his immature antics. Maybe the writers could get rid of his character and transition the novels and working with NYPD to Alexis. The relationship between Alexis and Beckett would be enough. OR, it will be the same up and down on and off between Castle and Beckett.  This seems to be about smart women making stupid choices: how long will Beckett keep babysitting the American male ... the Scotland Yard guy was a better match.Episode 3: So, we saw it coming, I trust - FEDERAL means FEDERAL. The job was the right move, if nothing esle to show Kate what it would be like and the freedoms that would be compromised by hitting the national scene. The career investment in major cities like New York and Los Angeles is hard to leave behind, especially with coworkers, friends, and family there as well.

5.0,I am a huge lover of historical & sword & sorcery movie's & found this to be a fun action filled period piece that was historically accurate enough to enjoy the costumes & weapon's. It also has a interesting twist that makes what could have been an over used plot into a visually stunning adventure worth the watch. And its always fun to see Celts painted in their notorious blue woad designs. I also loved to see the Great Sword used with half swording techniques. As a matter of fact the fight scenes were choreographed better than the genre's average fight scenes. With colorful characters{ some literally} graphic battles & a all or nothing quest this is a great way to spend a couple hours on a rainy day.,1390003200,2014-01-18

4.0,"I've been watching this show since the first episode on AMC. Season 1 was brilliant, season 2 was not so good, season 3 improved, and season 4 keeps on getting better. The acting is better, the pacing is better, and the plot is better. In the past seasons, the female characters were all helpless and stupid. It was very frustrating watching them be so weak and stupid. I wanted stronger female characters. It is still not on the same level of the Sopranos or Breaking Bad, but it's very enjoyable to watch and it's hard to stop watching. Very binge-worthy. My one complaint (this is why it's not 5 stars) is that it can be predictable at times. In many episodes, an new character will be introduced and by the end of the episode, that person is dead, or there will be minor character that will have been with the show since the beginning (T Dog) or a few episodes (the guys in the prison) and they will have very little dialogue and we won't know much about them, and then all of a sudden in one episode, they get some dialogue or we learn more about them, and then by the end of the episode, they are zombie food. It makes the show boring at times.",1387929600,2013-12-25

5.0,"Nashville, as the name implies, is a Nashville based fictional drama television series about up and coming, and, already famous country music singers. It airs on ABC.Season 1 introduces some of our favorite characters and the first bits of trouble and drama. Connie Britton is amazing as country sensation Rayna James. One of my top two for this series. Rayna is an established artist, mother of 2 and daughter of the Mayor all while remaining very grounded and stoic. She struggles with folks at the label, whom she feels is stifling her career.Then there is energetic and always stirring up something Juliette Barns played by Hayden Panettiere. Juliette is a young, country pop star, so to speak, and she is ready to have legend status. In her ambition she is always leaping without looking first. Then forever trying to live down an event she really isn't bothered by to begin with.Deacon Claybourne (Charles Esten) is Rayna's long time front guitar man and former flame, though she is married to Teddy Conrad (Eric Close.) There is always some tension between the two as they vie for her time and attention. Rayna will have to make some changes to hold peace in her life.A few of our newcomers in the world of country music include Scarlett (Clare Bowen), Avery (Jonathan Jackson) and Gunner (Sam Palladio.) And yes, there is definitely some heat and friction with these young people out there trying to make it. The drama is there, but these kids always go back to the music. I think it is part of what makes them endearing.I really enjoy the acting on Nashville. Especially that of Britton and Esten. I feel they make their roles so believable and interesting. The show really encompasses all aspects of the musical scene in Nashville, involving artists from made status all the way to entry.The first season is my favorite so far.",1397088000,2014-04-10
5.0,"This series so riveting with a twist ending on who done it.  It leads you to suspect characters that absolutely could be the perp, but then &#34;no&#34; it's not that person after all.  Who actually did the bad deed comes as a surprise and the journey to that person is filled with edge of your seat excitement.  I absolutely loved the first season &#34;who killed Rosie&#34;.  It took two seasons to complete the Rosie story.  So all three seasons are dark and very sad so watch with caution if you are sensitive to violence. Perfect actors to carry these rolls that it makes it so worth watching!  The third season was solved but left open to continue yet another season.  I hope that it continues.",1379548800,2013-09-19

5.0,"I thought that the movie touched on a lot of strong issues. !!!!!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!! Religion was a small part of the message, but it also showed some of the dangers that hypocrisy can lead to. For example, the mother was the most openly religious person and her fears about what would happen to her daughter were based in reality (though she related it to religious concepts, which to me was a mistake), but at the same time her daughter didn't take her seriously because her mother had lied to her earlier in her life. The mother was trying to convey a truth regarding relationships to her daughter, but because she wasn't truthful herself, that truth meant nothing. It's that attention to detail that makes this movie great; the wife obviously has a character flaw, but then you have to think of her imagining her mother as a liar, one that told her that her father was dead when he was really alive, and that made the daughter hate what her mother was trying to teach her. I also liked how the movie discussed long-term benefits vs. short term benefits, because when information is just a click away for people, everyone wants things &#34;right now,&#34; without ever having earned it or appreciating it. People want that flash of extravagance, without realizing that the feelings it gives do not last, and this movie indirectly hits on those kinds of issues. It's just a great movie all-around.",1394582400,2014-03-12

5.0,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" has a few of those awesome, special episodes that not only hit all the right notes, but actually go even further. One such episode is ""Soultaker,"" a clumsy supernatural thriller that seems like an 80s teenage version of ""Carnival of the Damned,"" only with teenagers and hair metal. And guess who make cameos!The Satellite of Love"" is malfunctioning badly, complete with Gypsy getting mean and transmissions of Martin van Buren (I never understood that one). Pearl is uninterested in saving Mike and the bots, so she simply sends them the movie ""Soultaker."" But a mysterious ship is flying alongside the Satellite, keeping them in a tractor beam. Who or what is saving Mike and the bots?As for the movie, it's about a bunch of teenagers driving home from a concert... festival... thing, and they get in a nasty car wreck after they see a man in black standing in the road. And as the man in black pursues them, two of the remaining teens discover that they are actually BRAIN-DEAD -- and their comatose bodies will be taken off life support at midnight.""Soultaker"" is not the worst movie that MST3K has done -- it's not even the worst amateur attempt at one by someone who has a ""great story"" to tell. It's theologically muddled, inconsistent and has a lot of plot holes (how do DEAD PEOPLE operate the elevator?), but it has some decent moments. It's awkward and clumsy, and that's what makes it bad.That is something you can't say about the Mike, Tom and Crow segments, which are perfect. These guys had snarking down to an art form, whether it's joking about the clumsy script (""But shes upper middle class and we're slightly lower middle!"") or the funny-looking actors (""It's a catcher's mitt with eyes!""). And of course, many jokes about Joe Estevez.And the hosting segments are also fun, with Mike struggling to command the Satellite, even as Gypsy insults him and Tom and Crow have a wet T-shirt contest. But those segments become AWESOME when a pair of familiar faces drop in for a visit... guess who!""Mystery Science Theater 3000: Soultaker"" is one of those must-see episodes of the classic snark series -- it's funny, strange, and has CAMEOS.",1329177600,2012-02-14
5.0,If you like crime drama this is for you.  Rayland Gibbons is a Marshall that is above board most of the time but sometimes is not.  If you get a chance to watch from the beginning it all ties together very nicely.  I have started watching season five and this is the best season yet.  It is based in Kentucky.  He was a Marshall in Miami and got kicked back to Kentucky where he grew up and knows everyone.  He shoots from the hip and the crime and drama tie in well.  The bad guys are bad and he is a good guy that gets the job done.  It cool how the Marshals work and investigate different crimes in Harland county.

Also even though I like the French woman's character she really needed to wise up quicker..I could see her going back for her phone the first time in the hotel, but wanting to go back to the mansion when it was over run by gang members who would kill her or the others with no hesitation was insane and stupid. Her top priority should have been keeping alive for her family not risk her life for a smartphone with a dead battery with her family videos on it.Overall the show was very good, it would be great if they made the writing for the characters to match the intelligence of their audience.",1391904000,2014-02-09

It is also very well made - cable network quality and has solid character development in the first episode.  I want to see more.

2.0,"Joss Whedon has done a lot of terrific TV projects and I continuously wish him a lot of work and success. This is not one of those unfortunately, and I suggest it will probably not make it to a second season, and definitely not past 2 seasons.The fatal flaw is the casting. The lead actor Clark Gregg who plays Poulson just doesn't have enough charisma to anchor a show. Additionally, he can't pull off the Whedon voice. The sarcasm and irony are awkward on him.  The second fatal casting flaw can be summed up in three words that are synonymous with untalented actor: Ming. Na. Wen.  Ming Na-Wen is a so thoroughly untalented actor that she could not even convincingly portray an over-the-hill Chinese actress.  Maybe, and I stress MAYBE, she could convincingly portray a dead body, but likely only with the help of a heavy sedative.",1380758400,2013-10-03

5.0,"CENTURION is not really a history lesson. It is however great entertainment. The photography  is breathtaking and on blu-ray one of the best in picture quality I have seen so far.The often mentioned ""logical errors"" I can live with. This is more of an action movie anyway and there's a lot of very bloody action in it, well deserving the R rating.Great and well-paced direction by Neil Marshall (Doomsday, The Descent) this is in my opinion his best work so far.All of the cast (mainly British actors since this is a British production) are excellent in their roles, Michael Fassbender as always, is outstanding, but the best performance is by Olga Kurylenko, who plays the mute pict scout Etain. Playing a character without dialogue can be very difficult, but she is totally believable every second she is on screen.The director thanks Walter Hill in the end credits, a nod to THE WARRIORS which has some similarities to the story.",1390867200,2014-01-28

3.0,"The first half of this film is compelling, well acted and well scripted, all with some first class production design to really bring alive 1970s New York. Kirsten Dunst was exceptional in her role in the movie and brings warmth and depth to the love story and some subtleties to explain why the relationship fails.Unfortunately, once she leaves the story, it falls apart dramatically. Ryan Gosling's character - the protagonist until the mid-point - quickly becomes unlikable and fairly boring. The film then starts to focus on his involvement with a second-tier character that overshadows the real questions raised in the first half. And then there's a really dull trial that provides an excuse for voice-over at the beginning but becomes the focal point at the end.Ultimately the story offers no real insights or answers about a man who destroys the lives of so many around him. It might have been better to drop the ""inspired by true events"" title card in favor of some creative license to offer the audience some sort of satisfaction in the way the events play out. Still, this is not a bad film by any means but by the end it feels like a missed opportunity.",1345939200,2012-08-26
5.0,"Child's Play (Sidney Lumet, 1972)It is exactly thirty-eight minutes into Child's Play where the movie stops being a fuzzy, slow-moving mess and becomes something that actually seems like a Sidney Lumet film. The scene takes place in the chapel of the boys' school where the entire film is set. Robert Preston (The Music Man), who plays Joe Dobbs, the headmaster of the eleventh-grade class, an English teacher much-beloved of the school's pupils, is standing at the front of the chapel, facing the altar. In a pew a few rows behind him is Jerome Malley (A Touch of Larceny's James Mason), the headmaster of the senior class, who teaches Greek and Latin and, as a holdover from the days when corporal punishment was accepted in schools, still has the nickname ""Lash"". Dobbs delivers a monologue that sets up the entire rest of the film, at least the bits that haven't already been set up. And I can almost imagine Lumet, at the end of that scene, smacking his fist into his other palm, pointing at Mason and Beau Bridges, the other main actor in this movie, then pointing to Preston and yelling, ""THAT is the quality of acting I want to see from you idiots!""He gets it for the rest of the film.Plot: We open with Paul Reis (Bridges) as a senior at the school, on his way to see the headmaster, Father Mozian (They Might Be Giants' Ron Weyand), for the very, very serious infraction of drawing some obscene pictures on Malley's chalkboard. He's being escorted by freshman teacher Dobbs, who cautions young Reis that, while such actions may be amusing, they're not likely to get him anywhere in life. The camaraderie of the moment is shattered by one of the school's jocks lobbing a basketball at Reis' head--it would seem that Reis is what Jean Shepherd calls ""one of the nameless rabble of victims"" in A Christmas Story. Dobbs defuses the situation and everyone gets on with their lives. Fast-forward nine years. Reis is now a phys.ed. teacher who's sick of the public school system and has returned to his alma mater to take up a vacant position there. He and Dobbs pick up just where they left off, as great friends. Reis seems willing to bury the hatchet with Malley, but Malley is driven to distraction by his mother's imminent death, which he believes is being hastened by a series of anonymous, harrassing phone calls, and assaults on his own character (which include, but are not limited to, pornographic magazines being ordered in his name and sent to his home, as well as notes being passed by the students--it is never explicitly stated, but made obvious nonetheless, that all of this is homosexual in nature). We find out soon enough that Malley was supposed to retire at the beginning of the year, but refuses to do so because he is adamant that Dobbs not take over his job as senior headmaster; he considers the affable Dobbs not only unfit for the job, but in fact an agent of Satan himself (he believes Dobbs to be behind all the magazines, notes, calls, etc.). Reis walks into the middle of this, and while he's not explicitly tasked with choosing a side, his unexpected, and unlikely, ally Father Penny (King of the Gypsies' David Rounds in his first feature appearance), the oft-tipsy religion teacher, warns Reis that it's going to happen eventually, no matter how neutral he tries to stay. While this is the main conflict, there's also the ever-present bullying that, as we know, Reis is all too familiar with...but this class aren't just bullies, they're sadists; in the first act of bullying to which Reis is witness, by the time he manages to pull the children off, their target has damage severe enough that the hospital believes he may lose an eye. A second victim is mock-crucified, at which point Father Mozian is forced into considering whether to expel the culprits--which would, almost immediately, cause the school to shut down, as they comprise half the senior class (and thus, half the senior class' tuition). Assuming, of course, the authorities don't shutter it first.There is a great deal going on here, and the late Lumet manages to herd these cats very nicely once the movie finds its rhythm (which, admittedly, takes thirty-eight minutes). Mason, Preston, and Bridges, of course, were all known commodities by this time, and was there ever any question they were up to the material? As a simple portrait of the nasty goings-on at a boys' school, a generic slice-of-life drama, this would have been a damned good movie. But the final twenty minutes, which turn it into something very different indeed, take it from ""good"" to ""blow the lid off."" In the hands of a lesser director, or performed by lesser actors (and to be fair, there's a time or two where it seems like Bridges is about to slip over the line), this could have come off cheesy, if not unintentionally hilarious. But it is meant to be horrific, and it succeeds. This is tragedy of Greek proportions, with the school's gang of bullies functioning as the chorus of harridans, and had the first thirty-eight minutes been as taut and compelling as the final hour, this would be Lumet's second five-star film in my library (Dog Day Afternoon is the other). Even with that considered, this is another guaranteed slot in the top thousand for Mr. Lumet; the brilliance of the last sixty-two minutes downright overwhelms the unfocused, muzzy quality of the first thirty-eight. **** ",1364169600,2013-03-25
4.0,"Although I only saw the reviews and haven't sat down long enough to watch a full episode yet, but with Kevin Bacon starring in it, it has to be good and the fact that it's a psychological thriller?  Even better!",1360022400,2013-02-05
2.0,"The cast and the previews looked worth watching...I watched episode 1 and within the first sequence I knew what was going to happen and I knew who was the &#34;bad guy&#34;. Dermot Mulroney, who plays the bad guy, looks terrible... dirty and dingy and not-watchable.The premise is stupid. I am to believe that a group of teenagers whose parents are the most powerful and influential in the country (including the president's son), ALL are on a bus... a &#34;normal&#34; field trip... WITH only two secret service vehicles following them and no other security to be found... AND no security ON the bus... AND a crazy ex-FBI (or other 3-letter word agent) is on the bus with them. Seriously! First, isn't a secret service agent to be WITH the president's kid at ALL times, WITH him, by his side, ON the bus? Second, none of these other high-powered people have security around their kids at all... and third, a field trip, a freaking field trip. Where the hell where they going? What field trip with 16-17 year olds? WHERE ARE THEY GOING?And... a secret service agent is suppose to lay down his life for the president and his family. They are NOT to be compromised. But oh... wait... if I buy into this premise, of course they are easily compromised.That premise within itself made me roll my eyes. Then it gets better... &#34;send the other vehicle ahead to secure the restaurant for lunch&#34; yeah, the one other secret service vehicle... WHAT?... oh, but wait.. it gets better... the other vehicle disappears then there is a road block... AND... let's get out of our vehicles and NOT secure the president's son and just see what's going on... WHAT?All of that in the first 15 minutes... I'm suppose to buy that... but oh...I find out that the show is going to be centered around a bunch of teenagers... ummm... no.Gillian Anderson, bless her heart... she looks good but that's about it. No emotion... none! And she did have a line for that something about... &#34;I'm not going to be this way for long&#34;... WHAT?oh... but wait... the bad guy, is of course, the BEST at what he does... which I guess is controlling everything thru his computer setup... and the FBI (or some other 3-letter agency) just fired him for something that he, of course, did not do, and let him go on his merry way.One positive note: The storyline with the new-to-the-job secret service agent was pretty good. IF I watched the show again it would be to see how he saves the day, which is where it is seemingly headed. I was engaged with this part. I wanted to see what he would do to save the boy and himself.I didn't care about the rest of the story. I just wanted it to be over. However, the series could be saved. If I was writing it, I would get the teenagers rescued in the second episode so that little teen drama is over. Kill the supposed bad guy and find that he was actually working for someone else so there are is a &#34;real&#34; bad guy. And have a storyline in there of how the secret service and the FBI screwed up. But the remainder of the show would be the FBI against this new bad guy and of course, saving the day.Anyway, this is bad. I could probably pick apart every scene. The suspense is forced. The story itself should produce the suspense. Suspense is not just drawing out a situation, making us wait wait wait for an outcome that we know is coming.At the end of the episode the bottom line seemed to be... what would you do to protect your child?... Well, it didn't seem that any of those high-powered parents did very much to protect their child by putting them on a bus for a field trip with no protection. So I guess the answer is... not so much... along with my rating.",1396224000,2014-03-31

It is very clever writing and keeps you guessing about the costars husband. What is he up to? Also the mystery about her father. Plenty reasons to keep watching.

Most people make fun of the network, but I bet they haven't watched this show. It has good acting (the two leads are very likeable), clever and often funny writing, very good special effects, a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline. Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it's quality.

No. The first 2 seasons had a really tight-knit crew with very human dynamics. You were always kept on edge not only by the actual animals from the anomalies but also from trying to figure out what the spin was between the characters. Now, with a different leader on the crew, the dynamics really changed. I found myself laughing at some of the outrageous actions taking place. Yes, some laughing at the absolute impossibility of the situation in which they found themselves (read as &#34;ridiculous, foolish, unbelievable, what were they thinking?) But, also, some really good laughs involving the dynamics of the crew and other characters. In this case, I really had a rip-roaring good time- Danny is a complete smart-mouth and has a major attitude problem with authority, which he makes no attempt to hide.

This season focused more on the local characters and their  interesting eccentricities and traditions, which is more interesting than past times when the emphasis shifted to almost traditional out of town mob villains. The interwoven lives of the characters continues drawing interest. The continuing drama between the good of Raylan and the bad of Boyd continues making both most intriguing characters. For viewers who like a modern day battle between U.S. Marshals and a number of villainous characters who are also trying to put something over each other, this season will be a delight.",1390694400,2014-01-26
5.0,I have only seen 1 episode and had to pay extra for it so the pleasure of watching it was greatly reduced.  It would be better to wait until all of season 2 has been filmed and them offer it as season 1 was.

5.0,"This is a pretty realistic view of what would happen during a nuclear war.  I do believe people would come together and help each other.  That being said, communities would come together like they did in Jericho and would help each other, until the food ran out.  After that it would be every person for themselves.  Luckily we don't have to see that.  What we do see is what would happen after a  nuclear exchange.  Modern things stop working, food stops arriving and people that get common injuries and colds all of a sudden become life threatening events.  I like the stories, I like the characters.

4.0,"When Season One of ""The Killing"" premiered on AMC, it was an instant critical darling. An adaptation of a successful Danish television series, it was an intense and quiet show with a slow build drama that got under your skin. Those eager for easy answers and constant action might have needed to look elsewhere because the pace of ""The Killing"" was more akin to the unraveling of a fine novel than to that of a breakneck thriller. In the premiere episode, a young girl named Rosie Larsen was found murdered. Each episode represented one day following three distinct story threads. We saw the investigation progress, we examined the painful aftermath on the girl's family and friends, and we reflected on how the murder might be tied to local politicians and bigwigs. But despite its critical praise, which included six EMMY nominations (including Lead Actress Mireille Enos and Supporting Actress Michelle Forbes), the first season ended on a note of controversy. Fans felt betrayed that all of the answers into the mystery were not revealed and their vitriol was quite vocal! (Strangely enough, the show was canceled and then uncanceled and Season Three is currently on TV).Season Two, consisting of another 13 episodes, picks up directly where the first season concluded. Enos and her partner (an invaluable Joel Kinnaman) are now at odds after the season finale revelations. If anything, though, she is even more obsessed with finding the truth. As she doggedly pursues the investigation, it alienates her further from the department. Mayoral candidate Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) is facing a new set of obstacles, also due to the events of last season. Seemingly out of the race, he will prove that he still has the stuff to be a major political player in the city. And the Larsen clan is in tatters, with mother (Forbes) on a spiritual sojourn and father (Brent Sexton) left to hold the family together. The three plot strands will weave in and out of one another as Enos follows the leads. Was Rosie a call girl? Is her death related to the suspicious activities of a local Indian casino? Was there a political motivation for her demise? Or was it something closer to home? This time, all will be revealed.""The Killing"" continues to take its time, and the case takes a number of false turns before arriving at its final destination. There certainly are a lot of nefarious and unscrupulous characters in the Seattle area! Truthfully, I don't disagree that two seasons for this one case seemed to stretch the limits of what was necessary. But there are some tense and memorable moments throughout these episodes. I'm glad I stuck around for Season Two. In addition to smart scripts, the cast is absolutely first rate. Enos is fortitude personified, Kinnaman gives a star-making performance, Campbell is surprisingly strong, and Sexton is a powerhouse. I also liked that supporting players Kristin Lehman and Eric Ladin (as Campbell's staff) really come into their own. Perhaps the show's most unorthodox choice, however, is with Forbes. Continuing to explore the stages of grief, this tremendous performance is sidelined from the rest of the principle cast for most of the season. It's a bold choice, but I could watch Forbes all day! ""The Killing"" is an adult entertainment that requires patience and rewards it. If you enjoyed the first season despite its inconclusiveness, I really recommend Season Two.

1.0,"According to wikipedia dot org, it's a 2013 French-Danish co-production crime thriller film written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. It was shot in Bangkok, Thailand.According to indiewire dot com, director Refn confirmed the cost of this movie was a little bit more than $5 millions.The worst thing about this movie was all main characters were emotionless. They did not express any emotion with their faces and words at all. It's as if they had been wearing masks. For example, the main policeman, he brutally killed some bad guys but his face was like a stone from the beginning till the end of the film. He did not show any anger or hatred.On top of that, there were very few dialogues. This made the problem worse.It's almost like a silent movie. For the first 10 minutes, it held my attention by forcing me to guess what would come next. Then, it became boring and tiring because I had to constantly try to interpret what the director wanted to convey with his video. It did not connect with me. It did not stir up any emotion. I did not care what happened to all the people. What's the point of watching a movie without feeling anything? In this regard, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's an example of how to make a bad movie.There are so many illogical holes and too much violence that make it less entertaining. For example, the scene where the assassin fired his machine gun into the small restaurant where the 3 policemen were eating. The policemen flipped the wooden table they're eating at and used it as a shield. Miraculously, no bullets hit the table. Yeah!The violence was so over-the-top that it became sadistic. For instance, there was a scene where the policeman poked the eye of a bad guy with a pointed metal stick. He also thrust it into the guy's ear.Almost everything was in slow motion. Even the scene where the policeman chased the assassin was in slow motion. At first, this technique drew my attention. Then, it quickly became irritating.The hand-to-hand fighting scene between Ryan and the policeman was so childish it's laughable. Ryan was not suitable as an action actor.UPDATED Aug. 19, 2013According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film:Release Date: July 19, 2013Domestic:  $765,400+ Foreign:  $8,977,609= Worldwide:  $9,743,009So, it's a big flop in North America. No, I CAN'T FORGIVE this movie.In short, it's a waste of time and money.",1375056000,2013-07-29

Star Trek: Enterprise).  Both Veronica Mars and Enterprise series didn't die out because of a lack of viewership but the confusion of the changes of the networks.

4.0,"Most of the issues I have with this movie have no bearing on the film itself, but with my problem understanding the Irish/Scottish fairy tales and certainly, the manner of speaking.  I should have turned on the subtitles but I'm not sure that would have helped.  I never heard of selkies for example.  In any case we are kept guessing until the final act.  The young woman (Ondine) turns up in a fisherman's nets.  Ondine is played by the stunning Alicja Bachleda.  It's hard to take your eyes off her.  The fisherman is played by Colin Farrell in one of his better roles.  The guy has acting chops.  The film does take a turn to the dark side eventually which takes away from the growing mystical romance that encompasses most of the movie.  I guess, director/writer Neil Jordan has to bring the film back to reality, but the thriller aspect seems a bit of a 180.  Still, I liked the movie and loved looking at Ms. Bachleda.",1319846400,2011-10-29

1.0,"Robin Williams is one of the funniest men to ever star on the silver-screen, but occasionally he does a weird dark comedy, that's very hit or miss. In World's Greatest Dad, Williams plays an English Teacher, who covers up his son's bizarre and embarrassing death. The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper, making his loser son, an overnight sensation. Williams is a great actor and gives credence to even a bad film like this, but even he can't save this one. The story is just ridiculous, his son (Daryl Sabara) was a complete nightmare that everyone wanted dead. No one would all of a sudden care, just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note. It's also extremely unrealistic, since his son was as stupid as they come. That being said, with the exception of newcomer, Eric Martin, the rest of the supporting cast was awful, making the film that much more unrealistic. World's Greatest Dad may have landed it's star, but it's a sloppy movie, that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's an hour and a half of pure torture, with the occasional funny scene that's all Robin Williams. This is one film that just starts out slow, never gets going and is anything but the ""hilarious"", ""wonderful"" film that I was expecting.",1361491200,2013-02-22

Branch gets some rough and ready surgery before making it to the hospital, where he continues to insist he was attacked by a dead man.  Walt then attempts to rescue his best friend Henry Standing Bear, in custody for the murder of Walt's wife's murderer.  He will also have to pull together a sheriff's office still reeling from a disruptive evidentiary raid by the FBI and Denver police.  This relentless episode is vastly entertaining. It manages to give all the permanent cast of the series some screen time, without solving any of many mysteries.In Episode Two, Sheriff Walt Longmire's life just gets more complicated.  A dead Russian female adoptee is found along the highway, sending Walt and Vic on the trail of what looks like a human trafficking ring.  Henry Standing Bear discovers that he isn't safe from Walt's enemies even in jail.  A battered Branch limps back to work, hell-bent on finding the dead man who shot him.

3.0,"This movie is different from the usual horror movie. It was a fun journey even if it isn't always successful.While watching this movie there is definitely one segment that stands out. I am almost certain it is the longest section and it is definitely the most substantial. I don't want to ruin anything so I'm not even going to say the title.This one segment is worth viewing the entire film for. It is just the right length, though it is the kind if story I wouldn't mind seeing as a feature length film.Aside from having one really great segment there are a few segments that are good and some that are alright. I am a strong believer in holding back spoilers so will try to stay away from being too specific.One complaint I have is that too many of the segments had some sort of zombie involvement. I like zombie stuff but I would have liked a little more variety in the stories.I know that I am being a brat here but, as with the first movie, I get the sense that none if these segments even pretend to have been filmed in a VHS camcorder. This is a really small complaint but the different directors don't really seem married to the that portion of the connecting plot. This results in making the connective tissue story a little bit lackluster.This time around they did get a few things right. The clips seemed to be the right length. The original had some that were just way too short.Overall this was a fun watch. They have created something that is different enough to be appreciated. I will gladly watch the next one.

5.0,"Outstanding acting and a excellent movie. Every single actress and actor was very talented.  The movie was both suspenseful and thoughtful.  Basically, it was a character study of the morals and ethics of a ruthless business person and of those he manipulated and used to his advantage.  It gave a very thoughtful insight into the main characters justification for his actions, as he tries to tie his behavior within the acceptable boundaries of the ethics involved within human interactions. Unfortunately, the main character displayed all the signs of being a sociopathic narcissist. Ending? No there was no real ending, because in his world and sometimes in the world of business in general; as long the end (bottom line) justify the means (getting there) there is no blame. No one was really hurt...just a potentially disastrous near miss.  Life and business goes on as usual in the pursuit of gold and recognition...",1375920000,2013-08-08
1.0,"Oh no, ""Ancient Aliens"" again. The *fifth* season?! How many silly seasons can there possibly be? And all the true believer reviewers again! ""Lots of cool facts"". Geezus. Good people, there are arguably *no* true facts in this series *at all*.True to form, I've only watched one episode, ""The Von Daniken Legacy"". I admit that I hate Erich von D&auml;niken. His ideas or ""question marks"" about aliens visiting Earth in ancient times (in pyramid-like UFOs, to boot) must be *the* worst superstition ever spawned. Homeopathy and reductionist materialism, come back, all is forgiven! D&auml;niken's ""theories"" are so remarkably ridiculous in a kind of inimitable folksy style, with the main protagonist playing the role of fat German bar-owner spewing ""common sense"", that they almost make me weep! The fact that I used to believe in ancient aliens myself only ads insult to the injury. OK, I was only eleven at the time, but hell, I'm a perfectionist.And yes, I need to chill and have a candy bar, I know...OK, I'm back. Has ""Ancient Aliens"" become any better during my coffee break? Well...no. So here goes!I'm not necessarily opposed to rejected knowledge claims (avid readers of my reviews, all two of them, may have noticed a certain soft spot for Bigfoot and...ahem...John Michael Greer), but D&auml;niken's speculations really are annoying and extremely unsophisticated. D&auml;niken, a romantic adventurer of the classical kind, has no formal training in archaeology, anthropology or comparative mythology I'm aware of. Yet, he goes around the world, see mysterious stone structures, declare them ""impossible"" and...voil&aacute;, this proves that aliens built them! The magnificent stone structures at Puma Punku in Bolivia are declared ""impossible"", when a more reasonable hypothesis is that they *aren't* impossible at all - I mean, they are there, aren't they, and they are made out of sandstone, not moon rock. That the local Natives can't build them, and point to the sky as explanation for who did, leads D&auml;niken to conclude that...well, aliens did it. It's all so breathtakingly simple.Another example is Lord Pakal at Palenque in Mexico, debunked at least 10,000+ times, but still going strong. If looked at horizontally and with some creative imagination, the lid of Pakal's tomb looks like a guy manning a space rocket. If looked at vertically, using scholarly knowledge of Mayan mythology and iconography, the magnificent artwork shows Pakal being symbolically sacrificed. But no, D&auml;niken's folksy immediate impression simply must be true, or else no ratings for History Channel...Indeed, it's precisely the populist style, pitting independent researcher against the scientific establishment, which explains part of D&auml;niken's appeal. D&auml;niken is our ""audience substitute"". While everything you read in peer-reviewed journals isn't necessarily true, there *is* a reason why archaeologists need formal training, not just the ability to run around inside megalithic monuments gasping at the sheer ""impossibility"" of it all. There is another salient feature of the ancient astronaut milieu, too, one D&auml;niken is at pains to explicitly deny in this documentary. D&auml;niken says he hasn't formed a new religion. In a purely formal sense, he is right. He is *attacking* religion by a modern form of euhemerism, in which the gods are explained away in ""naturalist"" fashion as space travellers in nuts-and-bolts craft. What D&auml;niken doesn't want to see, but what surely almost everyone else spotted long ago, is that the belief in ancient astronauts is *in effect* a new kind of religion. At the very least, D&auml;niken is offering the masses a potent substitute for religion. The large amount of spiritual types who have climbed onboard the fiery chariot surely shows what we are dealing with. As for D&auml;niken himself, he even claims that the aliens created us and will return one day! Thus, he is specifically tailoring his speculations to an audience used to the *Christian* religion. I don't think Taoists, Shintoists or the Dogon in Mali eagerly awaits ""the return of the gods""...Claude Vorhillon and his Ralians are the most obvious example of how ""ancient aliens"" can be turned into a religion (a religion which claims to be materialist, in fact). In their case, the quasi-Biblical traits are very obvious. Zecheriah Sitchin is another example of a person forming what is really a new religious movement around ideas presumably inspired by D&auml;niken's. And D&auml;niken himself? Isn't he really the exoteric attractor of the new creed, its Aaron so to speak? If you take the bait, I'm sure more ""esoteric"" people are waiting in the wings. I've heard that the Ancient Astronaut Society, which started as a D&auml;nikenite fan club, ended up as a New Age group. Thus, paradoxically the appeal of D&auml;niken's message could be seen as a combination of both populist anti-science and elitist ""hidden knowledge"", both modern irreligion and post-modern religion. An interesting object for a comparative religion study, I'm sure! These people don't understand that *they* are the ones that should be placed under the sociological and psychological microscope...The religious/Meaning aspect is surely the reason why so many people are oblivious to the (easily spotted) contradictions in D&auml;niken's books. How can aliens (that's *aliens*, for heaven's sake!) breed true with humans? If they can, why has no alien DNA been found in our gene pool? (Albert Einstein doesn't count.) Why would aliens need to build stone structures at Puma Punku, if they have super-advanced technology light years ahead of us? Why aren't there any *real* traces of a high technological civilization in India, if the Vedic peoples interacted with aliens? D&auml;niken's supporters point to ""mysteriously"" charred stone walls as evidence for ancient A-bombs, making you wonder why the bombs didn't obliterate the whole town, rather than just charring its walls...Seriously, should I continue?Are there real, unsolved mysteries in the universe? Oh, definitely. You already know which ones: where do we come from, why are we here, where are we going... And why *this* fun house of a planet? I'm willing to contemplate the erroneousness of materialism, the existence of Spirit, even one or two paranormal phenomena (although hopefully not on my favourite Swiss hotel). But literal, flesh-and-blood (or green jelly) aliens scaring the living daylights out of Moses, breeding true with female ape-men, and erecting stone structures of a suspiciously-looking human provenance all around the globe just for their higher amusement (and ours?)...naaaah. It's bad archaeology, bad anthropology, bad comparative religion, and - when push comes to shove - probably even bad spirituality.Erich von D&auml;niken and his fiery chariots is a legacy I would rather loose.

5.0,I've watched this series twice now and enjoyd it greatly each time.  It takes you back to the early 1900's when such things as indoor plumbing and electricity were new.  It takes you back to the days when who your parents were dictated what success you would have in life.  You will find yourself laughing (and crying) with the characters involved.An excellent seledtion for entertainment and a look at early post-World War I England.,1398643200,2014-04-28

4.0,"LAD is good escape. For some reason I do not find it as gripping as the original series and it's easy to see through the formulaic plot lines.If another version is in the making, suggest some real curves instead of following a recipe that makes it easier to see what's coming long before it arrives.Again, it's still good escape if you like living on the edge. I will never figure out how Jack goes for 24 hour stretches with no sleep, but I guess that is not for me to know.",1404777600,2014-07-08
3.0,"Taking a popular fictional series and adapting it to fit a one-hour television format has to be a daunting task.  Sure, it's been done with some success such as Robert B. Parker's Spenser and Jesse Stone or Tony Hillerman's  Chee & Leaphorn novels (though except Spenser the other's were 2-hour movies).With A&E;'s ""Longmire"" they have taken Craig Johnson's present-day sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming and brought him to the small screen.  If you never read Johnson's excellent stories you probably wouldn't find much to complain about.  But, as other reviewers have noted if you have read them you are in for a disappointing and befuddling experience.Casting is key; Robert Taylor looks the part of Walt Longmire.  For the most part the actor does a credible job portraying the character that is written fairly true to the books.  Mr. Taylor doesn't seem comfortable wearing a firearm though; he's always resting his hand on the butt of his pistol, kind of a rookie move for an ex-Marine and long time peace officer.  Not sure looking like you're about to ""pull"" on everyone you talk to is a good strategy.  Katee Sackhoff has been critiqued by others in her role as under sheriff ""Vic"" Moretti but mostly for being blonde instead of brunette.  Hair color aside my problem with her is she's just not obnoxious enough as she should be, more of a ""Vic-Lite"".  The biggest problem with the cast is the critical person of ""The Cheyenne Nation"" (as Walt calls him in the novels), Henry Standing Bear.  In the books Henry is a large man and an imposing physical presence and Lou Diamond Phillips, while a fine actor, lacks the sheer physicality to pull this off.For the readers familiar with the Longmire tales one of the more disorienting features of Season 1 is they start off each episode with almost exact recreation of the crime from one of Craig Johnson's books.  Naturally you think, ""oh, I know where this is heading"" but actually you don't as the screen writers then abandon Johnson's work and concoct a totally different set of circumstances.  It would be OK if the alternative solution was as good as the original but it never is.Other problems pertain to marginalizing important characters like Ruby, Walt's office manager or overemphasizing others like daughter Cady who's supposed to be living in Philly and not working in town and dating Walt's deputy who's challenging him for sheriff in the next election.  ""Longmire"" is hardly the worst thing on television but for fans of the original it's far from rewarding to watch.",1375056000,2013-07-29

I really love the way Tony B. speaks and brings you into his world of food, leaving no sarcasm and quip behind like in his series after his launch of A Cooks Tour.  If you got hooked on the more recent sarcastic, and somewhat misbehaving Anthony Bourdain and then viewed this series, which is very early in his TV career, you may end up feeling like something is missing. All in all, it is a good show, a nice way to look back and see how he was when it all began. A nostalgic look at a more mildly mannered Anthony Bourdain at the launch of his career, however, somewhat mildly mannered isn't what got me hooked. Will still watch, I appreciate a little nostalgia here and there.",1391644800,2014-02-06
1.0,"I think Fiction requires at least a little plausibility to work and frankly I couldn't see the group in this movie surviving a power outage, not to mention that even the most innocuous situation seems to provoke a 5-minute discussion (at times I felt like I was watching a Woody Allen film).  Discordant strings and chaotic cameras try to force thrilling atmospheres during the following anticlimaxes: the alpha-nerd discovers a slashed tire, a girl with some blood on her appears at the door (sending one of the quintet into borderline shock), the mysterious visitor subsequently locks them out of their cabin (oh the humanity!).  OMG, you gotta love the 8 minute, not-so-riveting argument on whether to go out into the dark night and find one of the team where they finally convince his wife to wait till morning by saying ""please... help us get Doug back"" (*camera zooms in on bewildered wife, mouth agape while crickets chirp gleefully in the background*).Featuring the most spineless, indecisive and petty, horror-movie-victim groups of all time hunted by a slasher of epically lame proportions (ooooo... his eyes are milky-white... s.s..scarrrry) ""The Killing of Jacob Marr"" comprises 1 hour/51 minutes of pure, cinematic flatulence.

Lucy Lui is also great.  After seeing her in Angels I didn't quite see her as Joan at first, but she is also sensational in her role.

They are only passing along the prices set by the movie folks. It is against THESE that we must revolt. I thought I was PURCHASING this movie. My bad for not reading before clicking. It was a $10 learning experience.I admit lately I have been paying $14.99 or $19.99 to buy a digital movie, or $4.99 or $6.99 to rent one. And that is, in all cases, too much. Poor people, and yeah, I am one, cannot afford these kinds of prices for movies. Not for DVDs even, and especially not for a digital movie. $4.99 for a rental is pushing it. $6.99 is wrong. $9.99 is a sin against the customer. Amazon should recognize this.

3.0,"Another one of those curiously short tv series that got cancelled mid season, this is interesting enough to wonder what it might have become as it matured.  As it stands though, it has not quite found its identity - though the 14 episodes it ended up as, showed promise.It's the beginning of the jet age, and Pan Am epitomises cutting edge sophistication.  The lives of a flight crew, 4 stewardesses and the captain and co-pilot, are explored.  This exploration ranges from the intriguing world of the sexual mores and burgeoning liberation of the time, a little social drama, the burgeoning feminism of the 60's, and - somewhat ludicrously - some spy drama thrown in for good measure.  Starting off as more or less stand alone stories in each episode, the series seems verging to a soap opera dynamic by its close, somewhat letting the characters down with the romantic entanglements coming to the fore.  If any of this sounds an intriguing mixture, within a show steeped in meticulous recreations of the period and consultants who were there and did it, then a cautionary note is that it is steeped in candy coated bubble gum style - the 60's are stylised through rose coloured glasses, and the Disney parentage means that the deeper issues that the series hints at are arguably never properly portrayed or investigated, though this does leave it watchable by a wide audience.Somewhat of a let down then in terms of what it could have been, I'm ultimately not too disappointed that this was cancelled - and yet it was something of a guilty pleasure while it lasted thanks to an appealing cast and intriguing milieu.",1369353600,2013-05-24
5.0,"Television has been called a vast wasteland. I've heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV. And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren't aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that's the case you're in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he's not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter's foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry's rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it's so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb's enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who's made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter's apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn't be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter's mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter's sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family's life crosses Dexter's life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He's impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it's discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid's of Dexter's past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what's driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of ""24"", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn't let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you're not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I'm already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about. Watch and see.",1242604800,2009-05-18
5.0,"From the Title of this review, you know where I'm going to take this.  First of all, let me say I'm not a fan of the horror genre.  I  don't go to them at the movies.  I don't bother with them on TV.  In spite of all the blood and gore, I find them tedious, predictable, and boring.  But I gave this one a shot in a desperate attempt to find something watchable in what is mostly a sea of mediocre filler on Prime.  Frankly, I didn't think I'd make it to the second episode.  But here and there are some surprising gems on Prime, although often rare and difficult to find.This is an excellent series that stands with the best.  There's the expected, horror, blood, and hideous gore perpetrated by demented sadists in charge of the institution.  They are Hell bent on making the lives of the inmates horrible beyond mention.  Some inmates shouldn`t even be in an asylum.  In fact, the basic premise is a horror clich&eacute;, but it's written and executed with aplomb.  It defies the usual tedium of typical horror by being delightfully unpredictable, and interesting.  Yes, interesting.  If it were a book, I'd call it a page turner.There's humor too, usually dark and dry to be sure, but I found myself laughing at some very clever lines.  If you can believe this, Episode 10, even has a brief respite with a production number, featuring Jessica Lange, and the rest of the wretched inmates doing a bouncy song and dance production in the middle of all the asylum chaos.  I know how this sounds totally inappropriate, but it actually lends itself quite well and makes sense in its particular context.  I backed it up and watched it twice, and I still want to watch it again.This series is probably the biggest surprise I've had on Prime.  Lange, who I've not seen much of in recent years comes out of obscurity and gives a wonderful performance.  She's not on her own, either.  She's working with some other well known and capable talent working outside their usual roles, at least the roles I`ve seen them in.  The rest of the cast is excellent too.  Perhaps the director deserves some credit for this.  The cast seems to fit together unusually well.  It's worth a watch.  You might be surprised.",1392940800,2014-02-21
3.0,"This is a cute movie and I found it to be enjoyable.  Nothing more, nothing less. Leslie Mann was the real standout, although it would be fun to see her in a role that isn't a whiny wife sometime. I sense there's more to her than the roles she's been cast in to date.",1405900800,2014-07-21

I know this stuff is covered with safety teams, equipment and emergency medical people, but it's so fun to watch. The interpersonal conflicts keep me coming back.

Not much of a plot. The final couple of twists to the story were interesting, I won't add any more spoilers, though.I like Matt Smith as the Doctor.

5.0,"I've thought of writing a blog about my experiences/views watching Dance Moms.  From the very start, I've enjoyed it although as time has gone on, the drama has increased and with it I've wondered if any is manufactured for the camera.  After watching it for the 2nd time on Amazon Instant Video, I don't think so and here's why:  if you watch the smoke before the fire episode where the moms and Abby talk with the executive producer, the drama is as (or perhaps even more so) than what is shown on regular episodes.  I could talk on and on about how and where and why it's so intense but I want to leave some for the viewer's (cringe) enjoyment.  I will say this - there's no hero here - not really one dance mom one could totally cheer for.  And as for Ms. Abby Lee Miller, let's just say that I had a band director who reminded me a great deal of her and I loved him.  She does some very questionable things but her eye for technique, from what I can tell, is dead on and as a music teacher myself, technique has to come first before ANYTHING.  I cheer for the moms occasionally and I never cheer for Abby when she's holding the children responsible for their moms' behavior.  For chrissake, they're all under age - Brooke is the only one who could really stand up to her mother as I had to do to mine when I was in band in high school.  The others are truly not in control of their destiny in most ways.  And by the way, shooting a movie in Hollywood does NOT make a child more outstanding than the other, Ms. Abby.  If you watch these episodes, you'll see what I'm talking about.",1366502400,2013-04-21

5.0,"I can't quite say why I love this show and really find it more interesting than anything else on television.  Maybe because it is set in my favorite city, Portland, Oregon, or because it has a perfect mix of police procedural, magic, horror, humor,  imagination, romance.  I love the cast, the morphing from human form to monster, and the cleverness involved in changing the Grimm fairy tales and other folk tales to modern form.  I am hooked and can't imagine watching television without this show.  I will be extremely disappointed if it is canceled given the real crap that goes on for seasons and seasons.  This show is a gem among all the rocks that are television programming.I want to add that I do find the subplot regarding the royals and the birth of the new hexenbiest/royal to be fascinating and well acted.  I love Captain Renard, that most elegant police captain/royal.  What is the horrifying event going to be following the Wildesheer attack?  I wonder if the writers have figured it all out yet.",1394236800,2014-03-08

4.0,"Season four seems to be vearing off to 'way out there' plots. But we still enjoy the cast of characters.  Show is original and entertaining.  As in previous seasons this show centers around a team who tracks down artifacts (items) that have been owned by someone famous (most of the time), which retain some form of special ability.  Once the item is located the go through a process where they obtain the item and bring it back to 'Warhouse 13' where it is stored away from the public.  This, in most cases, is the best thing to keep the public safe.  If you have not tried this show you have three previous seasons to catch up on.  I'm sure you will get hooked, as we did.

First of all, Melissa George is not quite believable as a fighter, being able to whip, or at least hold her own, against big, strong, muscular guys outweighing her by 80 to 100 pounds.  Secondly, typical British weirdness with the nudity.  Take for instance the head of her private company, he goes to a very expensive hotel, dressed in an expensive suit, and sits in a chair while a middle-aged prostitute walks around the room in the nude getting him a glass of water, then sits on the bed and stares at him and he just stares back?

4.0,"Inspector Foyle behaves and speaks exactly as we would ideally wish to have done in his place in the threatening environment of wartime where subtlety and nuance tended to get lost. In WWII Hastings, a resort town on the south coast of England, the proximity of the German forces across the Channel pushed people to make hasty decisions, often based on prejudice and invariably without pausing to reflect. Foyle is the epitome of patience, bravely resisting pressure from his superiors and the war department, creating time and space to see justice done no matter how complex the circumstances, He is assisted by two younger assistants who share his humanity and learn from his stoical attitude. It is hard not to feel that people like Foyle were the true heroes of the war effort because they constantly reminded everyone of the values we were fighting for.",1363824000,2013-03-21

5.0,"On the upside, the season went from criminal Wesen of the week to an ongoing stories which played out during the year.  The relationships were more closely involved in addition to the criminal Wesen on this sci-fi/police procedural. For me, they increased the enjoyment of this season, in many ways over the previous seasons, which I also loved.  Only now in Season 3 did Nick ask how the Wesen were able to see him as a Grimm.  The cliffhanger was exceptionally enjoyable and makes waiting for the fall even more frustrating..On the down side, I didn't get as much Monroe as I wanted given his comedic skills , but the last several episodes tried to ease my pain.  At the rate things are going, everyone in Portland will know Nick's a Grimm.  I would suggest they make it easier to attract new viewers to get a an insight into the series as they did during the first season.",1400803200,2014-05-23

3.0,"I love the show Burn Notice. It is a show I have watched religiously  from the begining.Bruce Campbell takes his sidekick job on Burn Notice to front and center in this TV movie. His Sam Axe Character back story is a cute idea to explore his TV mythos, which has never been covered fully in the four seasons of the show. If you want to view this film, he is the only reason to watch this film.After playing the character for four years, Campbell is comfortable in Axe's skin. The film is fairly done for a TV film, but the script by Notice scribe Matt Nix seems a jumbled mess with too many laconic ideals.Jeffrey (Micheal Weston)  Donovan directs this film without many of the Notice trademarks and style shots, which makes you watch this show more and more. It almost seem like this film was  rushed in its scope to wet your whisle for season five of Notice. Again the direction of this film  is due to the disorganized  script whixh plots in directions that peter outCampbell is likeable as Axe, but he has been likeable  in all of Burn Notice episodes. He can hold your interest, but this film is the wrong vehicle for him. He as I said before is the only reason to watch this tripe.Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",1303257600,2011-04-20

2.0,I've seen a lot of the documentary footage before in other works.  That part plus the fabulous interviews I loved.  But it was impossible to watch because the camera technique is to jerk the camera around so much that it's hard on the eyes.,1391385600,2014-02-03
3.0,"[SPOILER ALERT] I really liked this film. Well, until the last 10 minutes. The end was flimsy and sort of a let down, which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars. It seemed...rushed, perhaps, or, that it was the only ending that could be crammed in the last few minutes. During the movie, the curmudgeon, Arlen, is likable. Not only that, but he dispenses fantastic wisdom throughout the movie (an indication, of course, that these are the things that the screenplay writer has been working out in his own head for years). But at the end, when Arlen tells everyone that he's never really talked to God, followed by a terse explanation that lacked any sort of sentiment at all, it made everyone feel foolish for believing in him, both the readers of his book, and the viewers of the movie. The thing about believing in God is that it's never what we think it is. God doesn't 'talk', but the things that we do, the magic that we create, the art, the beauty, that's God. We don't need a God to come down and give us an explanation of life in such a definitive way. Had Arlen said that he wrote the questions and then subsequently wrote the answers to those questions with the understanding that the arrival of the answers were indeed from a higher power, the magic of the movie (and the character) would have remained alive. As it is written, it's just a schmuck who doesn't believe in anything, not himself, not God, nothing except for a woman who lies to her son because she is too weak to face reality.It's hard to remain beholden to someone who's already sort of a jerk to begin with, then to realize that he's also a liar without a lot of faith in anything, well, that just makes us dislike him altogether. It would have been better if he told the truth and said that he thought that he had written those answers without the hand of God to guide him. But when he found love, then he realized that there was actually some Divine Power out there looking after him after all. In the spirit world, nothing is as we think it should be. That's what faith is. Faith is letting go of everything and trusting that your Higher Power will guide you, whether it's God, The Universe, your Ancestors, Buddha, Jesus, whatever. It never looks like we think it will, and the writer could have capitalized off of that. The writer should have given Arlen a profound revelation, or something that would have made the movie worthwhile. In the end, a very strong movie collapsed under the weight of an insouciant narcissist who wrote a book that he didn't even care about.I think that the writer should have kept the magic alive. He obviously wanted it to be a feel-good movie or else there would never have been the love story. He obviously put a lot of effort into analyzing his own path. To discredit it by having his main character basically say that he's a liar and he has no excuse for it was sort of a cop-out and rendered the movie uninteresting at the end. I was totally inspired all the way through the movie, cried a few times even, but at the end, I stopped believing in the wisdom of the movie just the way that the main character did. Too bad. I would have given it 5 stars up until the last 10 minutes. Perhaps there could be a rewrite!",1343174400,2012-07-25

5.0,"The people who were involved with this film put together a nice little magical trip into humanity. I see some reviewers pigeonhole this film as a family film. Personally, I think it is a film for everyone. I usually enjoy a good comedy, science fiction, drama, or suspense journey in a movie. This film is none of the above.I have toyed with watching this movie for quite some time. Finally, the names Rob Reiner and Morgan Freeman yanked me into this magical opus. I do respect both men's abilities.I think John Lennon's words best sum up this movie...""Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.""As for the neighborhood portrayed in this film, I wouldn't mind living there.Road Trip",1351382400,2012-10-28
2.0,This movie could have been great if they had more production money. The actors probably took 80 % of the budget. They kind of set the movie up in the first few minutes with a book title about Dark Matter and the disappearance of the Lost Colony then it was like the Energizer Bunny it just kept going and going with no real plot development after that. Was it extraterrestrials controlling dark matter? Was it a supernatural force like vampires or aliens that are sensitive to all forms of light and discovered how to make it dark so they could swoop down and take their prey? Was the dark sentient and literally consumed people to survive? Was this the end or the beginning of the end? Was this just a way for the producer to make a quick buck(it bombed worldwide) without much substance? Was this a waste of 92 minutes? Tune in for the sequel. OK folks you can breathe now there is no sequel planned..at least not yet!!!,1398729600,2014-04-29
3.0,"There are many inconsistencies with this show, A homicide detective partnered with a coroner? His on again, off again girlfriend goes from being a nurse to the coroner's assistant, and his future partner; officially or not? This show appears to be more of a writing class of don't's than do's. Everything they teach you about writing and storytelling seems to have been thrown out the window with this show. I find myself doing something other than watching. If you're one of those people that likes to have the TV on for company and don't really need to watch it, this show is great for that. SPOILER ALERT; whoever is the least likely killer... did it! And like Clark Kent's glasses, only he and you can see it.",1397606400,2014-04-16
5.0,"**Spoiler Alert. There may be spoilers here, so if you want to remain a Being Human ""virgin"", don't read below.It is a little tough watching the American version knowing that the BBC version is not only in its 3rd series, but the BBC version is more original simply for having set the stage for SYFY.Don't get me wrong, the American actors are fine and their performances are great, but the british cast ""own"" these roles. It's almost like the Americans are renting theirs. The BBC characters seem more fallible, more realisting, and belong to their roles. It is like the BBC wrote characters to best suit the actors, and in the SYFY version, they did the opposite, but to a somewhat disconcordant effect.That sounds more negative then it is intended, but I did not like the twist at the end of the American season when the werewolf Josh (played by Sam Huntington) is hoodwinked into sitting out the grande finale battle royale. Perhaps the SYFY ending was more fitting, as it felt truer to the logic of their universe.Case in point, a man of twenty-something has very little chance of outfoxing a man of 300 who is perpetually on his toes and a master of his powers (SYFY). What the BBC version suggested is that in the heat of combat both 150-something Mitchell (Aidan Turner) and Herrick [an ancient vampire with full acceptance (and thus, control) of his powers and senses; played by Jason Watkins], are duped by the silly, often-unwieldy George (played by Russel Tovey), one into making ready for a battle royale that will never happen, and the other getting locked in the basement with the werewolf. Herrick HAD to see that coming.In this BBC season-concluding episode, there is faithfulness to each performance and plot that is rarely seen in this type of horror/sci-fi drama.Oh, and Lenora Crichlow is a slamming hotty. Meaghan Rath seems a far more morose, whiny version of the ghostly-friend. I would rather spend eternity with a chipper Annie and her endless tea-making than Sally-sulks-a-lot, moping and pouting. That would drive me bonkers. If Sally doesn't cheer up in season 2 of SYFY, I'm not sure if I can stomach it.Kristen Hager has better looks than Sinead Keenan. That's all I have to say on that matter. It feels like each series picked the correct actress to play across from their dopey werewolf roomie. Still, Nina seems a little more realistic in the role because she's not physically perfect. She is charming, and has a flair for the character. Kristen is believable as a young doctor in Boston, although I can't quite place why her character would hang around with Josh. I think given their dispositions, the only thing keeping these two characters together is the script.",1307836800,2011-06-12
1.0,"Can I have my hour back please?I really hate twists at the end of shows and movies that have very little to do with the show or movie I just watched, but I imagine it MUST be hard to fasten on a twist ending when the entire plot is a slimy eel wriggling in your grasp. That's simile.I'm not sure what was going on, and I don't guess that this show knew, either. I think the writers were watching ""The Walking Dead"" and thought aloud:""Let's make a show about OUR OWN apocalypse!""""But, hey,"" another writer said, ""zombies are SO last week.""""Vampires have been done to DEATH,"" injected Jamie Kennedy, coughing and stuffing his face with cheese puffs. ""What HASN""T been done in a while...or EVER (successfully)?"" They all shrugged their shoulders in a non-committal fashion and started hacking out the script for ""THE AFTER"".Putting aside the bong, they busted out the 20 sided die* they had from their Dungeons and Dragons game and made an alphabetic list of things that could cause an apocalypse that might be remotely entertaining, beginning with Aliens, and ending in Zombie-hybrids (leaving out E for ""Ear Mites"", I for ""Indiana Jones Impersonators"", L for ""Leprechauns"", P for ""Preying Mantis"", R for ""Rascally Rabbits"", and W for ""Wascally Wabbits"", much worse than the former).The only saving grace with the characters is that they were so fresh and original, no cobwebs to dust off these babies! A black prisoner innocently convicted, a white lawyer who's secretly corrupt, a vaguely hispanic female cop with everything to prove, a gay guy with a wacky day job, a slutty blond from someplace South-ish, a rich jewish lady with a spanish housekeeper, and... this will shatter your religion... an IRISHMAN who drinks WAY too much! It's preposterous! Am I forgetting someone...? Oh, yeah, the security douche bag. I think there was a protagonist too here somewhere, but tacked on in a slap-dash manner and thinly portrayed. Not worth further examination.That's called sarcasm.The featured characters are what Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter called ""Desperately Random"", which means NOT RANDOM AT ALL, but wishing to SEEM so. In THE AFTER's sense, it means that the characters are so oddly varied and/or paradoxically foiled against one another that it makes one wonder if they used that same 20 sided die to determine what half of the characters would be from the list: ""Harry's Hackneyed Stereotypes to Avoid at All Costs!"", and the other half just trying to make some allegorical diatribe about how things should be in a perfect world we don't have (boo-freaking-hoo!). Every time the convict talked about black folk in jail I wanted to slap him.Foil: innocent black man sent to prison for a murder he didn't commit vs. slick, white lawyer breaking the law by soliciting a hooker in a public stairway.Foil: same innocent black man with the ""CAN DO!"" attitude vs. the passive-aggressive white-spanish cop seeking to put him away, but ultimately, and utterly, ineffectual in any real sense. She was the ONLY authority figure in the ambulance and just caved like a jellyfish to the whim of the very guy she was sworn to capture. She would happily put away that innocent black man, but he's too busy delivering CANDY CANES and WHOOP-BUTT to protect the group, and he's FRESH OUT OF CANDY CANES, baby!I think the events that not even the police or the crowds stumbling around oblivious even realized was going on (...Wait, WHAT?!?!?!..) was that someone farted on set, and it was just really, really bad, so they had hours and hours of footage trying to figure out who farted. Seriously. Watch the parts of the show where people are just wandering vaguely here and there, scared of nothing in particular, but refusing to go back to their ordinary lives, and just imagine someone off camera letting one rip. You will suddenly understand method acting.At one point, all the people are racing around with luggage like they all remembered they had planned a trip to Majorca that afternoon and they're all going to miss their flight.Keep in mind, all this time there is NO ACTUAL APOCALYPSE going on. There are NO ZOMBIES, or anything else ATTACKING ANYONE, NOTHING is BLOWING UP, STARTING on FIRE, SHOOTING PEOPLE or BEING SHOT at BY people, and yet the mob of pedestrians decide to attack the group as if the ""heroes"" were Bogarting the latest iPhone design! It would be like you hearing a boom, losing power in your work, going outside, and then losing your mind with no conception of why you were there, blundering about for 45 clueless minutes and THAT'S when you see a group of folk in an ambulance and you just have to tear them apart with your bare hands for no particular reason! Why in the heck doesn't anyone just go home or back to work?Perhaps that's the reason why there's the non-apocalypse and suddenly a group that has no reason at all for hanging out together suddenly go all Scooby Doo Mystery Solvers Club despite their vast differences--or their secret sameness-ess-ess...? I don't even think the actors knew that the big-screen quality of the first 95 POINTLESS percent of the movie was going to sprint right into a cheesy ""B"" production right at the end. That's the REAL twist. Surprise! There's NO MORE MONEY LEFT to shoot this show. We blew it renting a wedding mansion, the 200,000 stand-ins, and these cameras. Good thing we didn't RENT the cameras, or they'd be going back, too.They really believed that if they just gave the group enough momentum that their pace alone would mop up any plot leaks, but it actually WAS the plot (or plot-synthetic) sprinkled all-too-liberally with brief, shambling pauses for character development. There's NO TIME TO EXPLAIN! Get out of the elevator! Now, let's talk about our feelings. Get out of the parking garage! Now, let's talk about our feelings. Get out of the street! Let's hear about those feelings. Get back to your hotel room! Now, let's hash out our feelings. Get in the ambulance! Quick, feelings? Bust into the mansion! Consensus... feelings? Sprint into the forest! Let's see how we're feeling. Get fondled by a naked, tattooed contortionist in grey henna! Feelings anyone? Get in your time machine and warn yourself not to watch this show... awe, dang. Can't do that last one. Show's over. Maybe time travel will be in the next episode. I have a... feeling that it might (could be F&%$#&G; anything, really).*Spoiler - They landed on D for ""Demons from the Netherworld"", and guess what? Each character has the same birthday. Hmm. Not sure that matters in the history of ever. Oh, but they each have a tattoo-like birth mark that together make some sick artwork on the back of the demon that stalks them for the last two minutes of the show so that it can give them shoulder massages in the forest. So, the fact that the SCG (Stereotypical Character Gang) are all suddenly so chummy and comfortable around each other is because they are all secretly connected despite having been introduced in an entirely (muffled snickering) random way. I'm blowing your mind now. Sorry. (SHHH.. its not random at all... keep it a secret...)I cannot even imagine what randomly (hehe) generated cinematic gold we will stagger into aimlessly in the next episode! If anyone in the next episode says anything to the kin of ""You guys are my family, now!"" I'm going to have to wash my eyes out with soap.",1393632000,2014-03-01

5.0,"What a captivating series of Charles Dickens'book LITTLE DORRIT.  I read a biography on Dickens by an actor-author who claims if writing was Dickens' wife, the theater was Dickens' mistress.  Dickens used to act out many of his books and characters the biography noted.  Dickens' true love was the stage, or theater.  He would go around the country doing readings of his books and act out the characters.  Perhaps that's why his books translate so well to film and the stage.  I actually prefer to watch them, than read his stories.  Especially if they equal the quality of this production.Every scene is exquisite.  The sets, the lighting, the camera angles, the props make early 19th century London come alive.  You want to freeze the frames and study the scene.  The screenplay was written by Andrew Davies who wrote HOUSE OF CARDS and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, the Colin Firth version (1995).  He's working on Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE to be aired on BBC in 2015.But back to LITTLE DORRIT, the acting matches the production's quality.  Speaking of Mr. Darcy, Matthew Macfayden is honorable and virtuous as Arthur Clennam who returns home to find a maid with a mystery in his mother's home.  The maid, Claire Foy, is a dutiful daughter and cares for her father stuck in debtor's prison.  Of course, Dickens wouldn't be Dickens without eccentric and oddball characters who snort and cackle and which are played to the hilt here.  It appears everyone is having a good time playing an oddity.  There's a bundle of characters and many subplots.It is an entertaining escape and may make you glad you live in 2014 instead of 1814.  This is the kind of series you can watch more than once as the detail is brilliant.  Love that it is free with Amazon Prime.  It pays for the subscription.",1386633600,2013-12-10

5.0,"Take This Waltz is a slow moving quirky movie. There was something unique about this film, something that caught my attention from the first moment.The film opens with a beautiful song, light quirky words, slightly on the folk side. The opening montage is a set of close ups of Margot making cup cakes. One of the last shots is of her sitting in front of the oven, a man in shorts walks past and the montage ends with an out of focus shot of the man standing in front of a bright window. I describe this very carefully because the film closes with exactly this same series of shots. They are identical, except for one small detail; the man is wearing long pants.The film then moves to a town on the east coast of Canada where Margot writes the new brochure copy for a Colonial town. A man taunts her to participate in a mock flogging. He ends up sitting next to her on the plane home. Turns out he lives across the street and they share a cab home, as they part ways she says under her breath, ""I'm married."" Margot is married to Lou, a chef writing a chicken cookbook.This next paragraph has spoilers in it. If you would rather not know some details, skip this paragraph.Ultimately, Margot ends up having an affair with Daniel. The literal interpretation of this affair is that she is a horrible person, doing what so many people do. She should be in love with her funny schlub of a husband. Her life is fabulous and she should be happy. Instead she falls for this handsome sexy guy across the street. I contend that there is another way to look at this film. Lou wore shorts a lot in this film. Daniel never wore shorts once, in fact the director made sure we got to see his Capri pants, they were always long pants; even at the beach. Margot never cooks in the whole film; in fact she hates the kitchen. The opening and closing montage style is completely different from the rest of the film. It is an intimate dance with Margot, the close ups of her bare feet moving gracefully. Throughout the film she wears funky sneakers, rarely barefoot. The opening and closing montage say that the affair was a fantasy. If I look back on the film with the idea that the affair was completely in Margot's head, the film takes on a completely different amazing turn. It all makes sense and is powerful.The film is beautifully made. The interiors are full of stuff, bright colored stuff. Margot wears some of the funkiest unusual clothes. The exteriors portray a Toronto neighborhood so perfectly, open and green. The trips into the city are tight shots with all kinds of activity everywhere. Michelle Williams is absolutely radiant. She is bohemian, wears those unusual clothes perfectly. She as well as Sarah Silverman are never afraid to take off her clothes. They are both beautiful women comfortable with their bodies. Seth Rogan and Luke Kirby are also confident, but both stand to the side to let the women shine. This is a strong cast. I do have one complaint about the Montreal airport, it is not Dorval - the chairs, halls, and doors are all wrong. Given the attention to detail in this film, I'm surprised that slipped in.The film is almost two hours long. It does move along at about the same slow pace throughout. Frankly, I liked this pace. This isn't an action picture; it is a sort of romance or a slow slide into a fantasy world. I would guess it was too slow for a lot of viewers. This is an R rated film. There are several scenes with full frontal and rear female nudity. There is a scene in the middle of the film where Daniel describes what he wants to do to Margot. It is one of the most sensual scenes I have ever watched where nobody ever took off their clothes or even touched. There is an artistic scene of two people having sex, reasonably well covered. There is some strong language. The film is intended for mature audiences.This film was less about betrayal and more about what boredom and fantasy will lead people to think. I loved the quirkiness of this film. The soundtrack was perfection. Sarah Silverman and Michelle Williams were amazing. Although slow moving, I was moved by this film.",1358380800,2013-01-17
5.0,"You would expect a thinking creature who has lived hundreds of years would be smart enough to use it's accumulated knowledge to do something to make the world a better place.  Plus also use it's knowledge to enrich itself, make it's existence more comfortable.

5.0,"The Shield: Season Sixwas Shawn Ryan's real farewell to his ne'er do well Strike Team: when Shane (Walton Goggins) puts a grenade in Curtis Lemansky's (Kenny Johnson) lap out of fear he may be an informant, it's all grisly cliffnotes from thereon out. The demented, righteous and corrupt Lt. Kavanaugh (played uncomfortably well by Forrest Whitaker) succeeds with the help of Acevada to put Lemansky in a position that is completely untenable: go to jail and possibly be killed by Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) or flee to Mexico and face the same fate as Vic's semi mentor, Ben Gilroy.We see Vic's psyche begin to defenstrate as he can find neither rhyme nor reason to Lemansky's sudden Salvadoran gang style death, and boy, when Vic's psyche begins to defenestrate, EVERYONE'S in trouble.  His ability to lie and delude himself to satisfy his own emotions--in this case, revenge--is demonstrated to such a terrifying pitch by Michael Chiklis that one cannot help but wonder why Ronnie Gardocki (David Rees Snell) didn't become his own man in time.Lemansky was the glowing nucleus of the Strike Team, the man with ethics enough to keep Vic and Shane's putrid souls alive with some measure of joy and balance them out a bit.  What is worse than his grisly death, perhaps, is the discovery that another Strike Team member did it.  Dutch begins to come into his own as the Team fades, and since it's now only three people, Claudette gets more leverage.The introduction of Kevin Hiatt onto the team shows what *might have been* if Claudette herself was not corrupt--since Vic is on the verge of losing his badge, she could have hired him as the head of the Strike Team, but she chooses Vic because of his animalistic street smarts.  Never once was this show boring; never once monotonous; every episode blisters with meaning, commentaries on the human condition and everything else within a very short time frame, which is why I rank it as superior to the Sopranos and The Wire.",1318377600,2011-10-12

4.0,"With the 2010-2011 television season wrapping up, it is official that the promising ""The Chicago Code"" will not be back for a sophomore year. An intriguing, if not wholly successful, cop show--I will say this one scored huge points for not being a typical procedural tackling a new case each week. Created by Shawn Ryan, the show excelled at depicting the political struggles and manipulations inherent in a government bureaucracy even if it didn't always ring true with its supporting characters and peripheral story lines. But at heart, the show's strengths far outweighed its shortcomings. I came into ""The Chicago Code"" with pretty hefty expectations, I must admit. Ryan created, in my opinion, TV's greatest police drama ""The Shield"" as well as the under appreciated and quirky ""Terriers."" Both of those shows, however, benefited from being on FX--a network that is able to provide edgier and more realistic fare than traditional networks (this aired on Fox). In most respects, you can see the distinct difference.The show centers around the appointment of a new police commissioner (Jennifer Beals) who vows to tackle corruption and complacency within the Chicago department. Aided by a former colleague and hotshot cop, Jason Clarke, the pair take on cases of particular political volatility. One of their primary targets is a potentially corrupt city alderman played with precision by Delroy Lindo. It is this continuing story line that gives ""The Chicago Code"" its greatest drama and intrigue.The Good: Clarke, a great actor who has been restrained in previous roles, has a chance to really break out here. Beals is an intriguingly complex character. And Lindo, as I mentioned, is riveting. He steals every scene he's in. The action revolving around his plot lines is dynamic and mesmerizing.The Bad: As great as the central characters are, the show falters a bit with its supporting cast. Clarke's niece is also on the force and having a dalliance with her partner. In one episode, this secret relationship is exposed causing a settlement suit to be awarded to a complainant. However, somehow the affair still remains a secret after becoming a part of public record. Huh? And there is an undercover cop in the Irish mob. He's a low level hood that somehow ascends to exactly the position he needs to be in. Very convenient and not at all plausible. Add the fact that he is constantly in contact with Beals and Clarke (even in public venues) and deep undercover has never seemed so shallow. The actors are all fine, the screenplay is just taking unnecessary shortcuts that undermine the show's truthfulness.The Perplexing: This being a network show, Ryan doesn't have the luxury of using realistically colorful language. He, therefore, makes Clarke a character who is offended by the use of curse words (especially in front of children). Okay, I'll buy it--except for one thing. He just substitutes euphemisms for swear words that sound just like swear words. If he were really offended by bad language, his vocabulary would reflect that--he wouldn't just make up new words.All in all, though, I enjoyed the show and think it might have developed into a richer and more rewarding experience. But we'll never know. For Beals, Clarke, and Lindo--this is still an easy recommendation. I'll follow Ryan to his next show (back on cable, I hope) and maybe that one can make it past one season (the great Terriers also didn't get a second season pick-up). If you like cop shows, you'll probably like this one too. KGHarris, 5/11.",1305763200,2011-05-19

5.0,"This devious little thriller simply *must* be seen. But you should know what you're NOT getting, in order to avoid disappointment.I had seen only the trailer and good reviews on Amazon. I was expecting more of an action-y British gangster film. But it's not really an action film -- although MUCH happens -- and that's a *good* thing. It is devilishly suspenseful.The first ten minutes are masterful. They quickly becoming horrifyingly suspenseful -- totally without dialogue. (The first line of dialogue is said at approx 6 min in.) That sounds boring, but it is the exact opposite: riveting. The story begins, and you must pay attention. The more attention you pay, the more compelling it becomes. This is *not* a movie to have on in the background while you clear off the kitchen table or do dishes. (My boyfriend does this all the time. It drives me nuts because he'll say, ""Eh, I didn't think [insert movie title] was that good"" and I'll say, ""Well, you really didn't watch it, you mostly had your back to it!"" And then when I make him sit down and watch movies I've liked, he'll say, ""I totally didn't get that the first time I saw it"" and I'm like, ""Yeah, 'cause you didn't *see* it!!"" Argh.)This is a movie to make popcorn for and sit down to really *watch* -- don't answer your phone, don't play with your tablet, make sure any kids are in bed and can't disturb you.The actions of the two men in preparation to commit a serious crime heighten the suspense. The supplies they gather are curious, then intriguing, then horrifying in their implications. The spaces in which they work are large with wide camera angles. Over time, throughout the film, both the spaces and camera angles slowly shrink, adding a visual claustrophobia to the psychological tension as the film progresses.The soundtrack is like a fourth character (and I'd like to buy it). It never gives things away, but alternates setting the mood with punctuating the plot twists and shifting dynamics. Pure music -- synthesizer-based modern sounds alternating with haunting organic notes of solo viola or cello -- evokes moods and heightens the emotion of unexpected twists, moments of pathos, shifts of alliance. It doesn't use pop music to buttress lousy chemistry or muddy action.This movie is not what the trailer implies. Truly unexpected plot twists alternate with slow reveals of the relationship dynamics, character back-stories (without flashbacks), and shifting alliances. Every time I thought I knew what would happen, who the characters were, what they were about to do -- I was wrong. As a jaded and cynical movie fan, and tired of predictable, cliche-ish, dumbed down movies, I found this movie fiendishly fun to try to figure out -- and I never really succeeded.Gemma Arterton's Alice is integral to the plot. She does a great job, she definitely holds her own -- but she by no means carries the film by herself, as the Amazon summary says. It's truly an ensemble, albeit a small one of only three people. The two male leads were gripping to watch. Eddie Marsan is amazing as Vic. (He was Inspector Lestrade from Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes reboots; he was also in two of the Channel 4 Red Ridings, and in the BBC's Little Dorrit). Vic's evolution is unexpected, believable, brilliantly done, and (by the end) surprisingly sympathetic. Martin Compston was new to me (I never watched Monarch of the Glen). But he's fantastic as the (initially) inexplicably conflicted Danny, seemingly one-down in the criminal partnership. In fact, the acting by both male leads is so good, your sympathy shifts back and forth from the obviously sympathetic victim character Alice to the two males, who initially are totally unsympathetic (because you think you know who they are and what they're about to do).The Disappearance of Alice Creed is not a ""big"" film with crashing violence and lots of guns and explosions. It's one of those films where the implied violence is almost as devastating as the violence that *is* committed. Like David Cronenberg's films, when violence or action occurs in this film, it *means* something: it has consequences -- it's not just there for vicarious and bloodless audience thrills. And although this movie fraks with you, it's not a conventional mind-frak movie, either. It's definitely a psychological thriller.Don't view this movie expecting Sexy Beast or In Bruges or a Guy Ritchie movie -- or even Layer Cake, with which it has some kinship psychologically and perhaps morally (but it never tries to be as consciously cool as Layer Cake). The Disappearance of Alice Creed has more in common thematically with the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple or No Country For Old Men, or with Carl Franklin's thriller One False Move. It's deadly serious about itself and that pays off in how unique and authentic the plot and characters feel. It's up to you whether you find the ending uplifting or bleak, a morality tale or an inevitability.WARNING: Stick through the first half hour/forty minutes, even if it looks/feels like it's about to become cheap Hollywood torture porn. It isn't. It's a much better and smarter film than that. By smart, I do not mean clever like a Guy Ritchie film is clever. (Not that there is anything wrong with that: I love Ritchie's films.) I mean, the entire thing could have easily been B-movie material -- but the script, the directing, the acting, and the execution elevate it way above a B-movie.There is a lot of female nudity, but I did not find it gratuitous (there's also a good amount of corresponding male nudity, under different circumstances). It's typically British matter-of-fact nudity. The female nudity serves the plot and heightens the vulnerability of the victim, but, as a woman, I found it to be as tastefully done as possible under the circumstances. If this had been made in Hollywood, the nudity would have been far greater, far more gratuitous, and much more like B-movie torture-porn. Fortunately, it wasn't made in Hollywood -- one of the reasons why it's so good.In a completely unintentional way I'm sure, I almost find The Disappearance of Alice Creed to thumb its nose at your average Hollywood thriller. It shows how good a movie can be when you focus on script, plot, acting, and direction -- to the exclusion of focusing on butts-in-seats and opening weekends, or trying to tweak those with focus groups and test screenings.The DVD extras are decent. Haven't listened to the commentaries yet, but the dual-screen comparison of the storyboards with the actual film was interesting and shows how well they adhered to the original visual conception. The outtakes are funny moments of the actors forgetting their lines or being unable to get past a fit of giggles (the guys, surprisingly). I watched the outtakes mostly to assure myself that nothing really bad happened to any of the actors -- that's how authentic and compelling the plot and characters are! I feel silly admitting that, but the first third of the movie is rather knuckle-whitening to sit through, especially as a woman -- you really fear the worst for Alice.Also: as with many British films, I had to watch it the first time with the subtitles on, or I wouldn't have understand some of the dialogue. I recommend this to non-British viewers unfamiliar with the accents of various parts of the UK. My second and third viewings, I didn't need the subtitles. (You won't get many subtitles for the first ten minutes, because there is no dialogue.)",1373760000,2013-07-14

4.0,"Dollhouse is a must-buy for any fan of Buffy, Angel, and/or Firefly/Serenity. The common demominator is, of course, Joss Whedon. Dollhouse, as his other creations, is like nothing else on TV. He has given us interesting and certainly flawed, yet appealing characters, and the stories keep us entertained and wishing for more.But the star of the show is Eliza Dushku. Every episode she plays a different character. Her main one is named Echo, but for the majority of the story she is someone else. Sometimes she is brainy and nonviolent, and sometimes she has to kick a little ass (and for us Faith fans, this is what we wait for!).The supporting characters are very good. They add layers to this show which are complicated, and sometimes they are not so nice, but they only add color and excitement to the episodes.The DVD set contains the unaired pilot, which, in my opinion was every bit as good as the one that WAS aired. And there is the unaired episode ""Epitaph One"" which can only be seen on this set. It was very good, but the ending left me with more questions than answers.This DVD set is well worth the money (which is very reasonable to begin with) and I would reccommend it to those who may not be Joss Whedon fans (or even those who may not know who he is).",1251504000,2009-08-29
1.0,Don't really like the underlying tones of drug references and bullying. Not exactly how I think the pilot episode should be made.

Then they proceed to show the bully making bath tub candy. I don't think this was well thought out. And I immediately turned it off for these reasons. You will be amazed what kids pick up on.

5.0,"NO SPOILERS:As K. Harris did the heavy lifting. I can provide a more granular viewpoint re: what I like about Copper.While some ""poetic license"" has to be allowed, as a student of history, BBC America nailed it!  The time period has been covered before in the big budget ""Gangs of New York"" who took somewhat more of a ""poetic license"" than BBC America.The Irish as a growing minority, the winding down of the Civil War, Tammany Hall, The integration of Blacks, the role of woman, the gap between rich and poor (& the fostering of well-known industrial titans) and general cleanliness (it might be a small thing, though look at the dirt caked nails of some of the main characters) are all topics prevalent to the time period.Copper is both well-acted and well scripted.  Franka Potente stands out with her best performance since ""Run Lola Run.""The storyline itself might only merit a *4 rating, though historical accuracy bumps Copper up to *5 IMHO.  Truth be told, I do have an ancillary motive, as my hope is that both commercial and critical acceptance of Copper will not only encourage BBC America to script additional programs, but that they will also open up the vaults by expanding their current offerings menu to include many of the fine programs that US audiences can only currently obtain through purchase.",1347494400,2012-09-13
5.0,"Hard not to get hooked on this episodic cops\spies & all around bad guys action fest with a brain. James Spader is witty, urbane, smart, sensitive and a merciless killer when necessary. But with an almost rational code of honor. Every week introduces a new villain from The Blacklist but also advances several interesting sub-plots. Not really a show you can drop in on mid season without missing important sub plots. Most of the characters are multi dimensional and keep you wondering about them too. Other than Game of Thrones, my favorite new show.",1399161600,2014-05-04
2.0,"I did watch all six episodes, and I probably will watch more if they make more. That main scientist shown in the picture is very annoying, I must say. As viewers we are somehow expected to believe that he knows more than he's revealing, but he just seems to be too contrived. The show reminds me somewhat of Flash Forward, but it doesn't come close in quality or scope.",1366329600,2013-04-19
2.0,"I wanted to like this film, we don't always get what we want. The cinematography was just so poor, under lit to the point I couldn't see who was talking or what was happening. Dark bars and night scenes can be shot so that you can still see the action but that requires skill and knowledge that was not evident here. Then there is the audio, it sounds as though the microphones were wrapped in wool. Muffled dialogue in the dark gets real annoying in a very short while, especially when the local accent and colloquialisms are already a challenge to understand. I was beginning to wish for subtitles. So much for the technicalities. The direction was just as poor. the pace of this film went from a fast walk to an agonizing limp then fell to the ground and crawled..slowly, painfully. I really don't care to see another scene in another film where our hero  character announces ""I'm an alcoholic"" at an AA meeting then goes out and sucks down a fifth of booze  straight from the bottle in between lines of anger and self pity! Can you say cliche! The comic relief was..oh that's right there was none. I hate to pick on child actors so I am glad to say there isn't one in this film. The young girl in this film sounded like she was reading and pretending. The woman playing Ondine, Alicja Bachleda, was sublime throughout. She was a living breathing complex creature on many levels. Colin was flat, a character without energy or dimension. I finally decided my evening would be more pleasantly spent trying to breath through a wet towel. Two stars, one for Alicja and one for what might have been.",1404000000,2014-06-29

I was disapointed when I missed this episode on cable, so was happy to find it on-demand.The myths covered here are the Curving Bullets as found hereWanted (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)(with Kari *very pregnant*, Grant, and Tory) and Sonic Boom Braking Glass (with Jamie and Adam).As usual, there is a good amount of humor in each of the segments and you can tell that they enjoyed shooting (pun intended) this firearm heavy episode. It was also great seeing the Blue Angel jets in the Sonic Boom episode.I will not say what the results were for these two, but it was a very enjoyable episode.Highly Recommended!",1249344000,2009-08-04

A classic piece of all Aardman's stop motion is the realness that he manages to instill in not just his main subject(s), but those in the background and even thoughts only partially on screen.  Each frame has just enough &#34;natural&#34; movement that you know a master is at work.  The stories are very funny with no real talking present or needed.  You just sit back and watch the interactions and understand the body language of the clay figures enough to follow the story.

2.0,"Our 'hero' isn't particularly heroic.  The British are portrayed at insufferable just for defending their homeland. The idea of a shield maiden isn't developed enough to mean anything.  A main character is both a boatwright and a seer without explanation.  Our hero is about to dump his wife for lack of a long string of male heirs.  I don't expect anyone to clean up history, such as it is, but some illumination might work.  Given this is a history channel exclusive, we could have woven in some explanation of the levels of technology we are witnessing.",1388534400,2014-01-01

4.0,"The knuckleball is an enigma in the sport of baseball.  Only a handful of pitchers in the 100+ year history of the game have thrown it well enough to make a career out of it.  This documentary focuses on two knuckleballers in particular (Tim Wakefield & R.A. Dickey) in trying to shed some light on both the physical and mental side of being a baseball oddity.There are basically two distinct themes running through this doc:1. A history of the pitch, so to speak, in which former knucklers like Charlie Hough, Wilbur Wood, Tom Candiotti, and Phil Niekro are interview regarding their thoughts on their bread-and-butter pitch.2. A narrower focus on Wakefield & Dickey, delving into more the psychological toughness needed to soldier on despite being label a baseball ""freak"", of sorts.This is a great little documentary for all baseball fans (especially those who vividly remember Wakefield's long career or Dickey's magical run with the Mets) and is about as unique as the fluttering pitch itself (I can't remember any other documentary covering similar material).  It is lighthearted, emotional, informative, and serious all at the same time.The only reason I can't give it the full five stars?  I wish it would have focused on the personal stories of Wakefield/Dickey even a bit more.  Their interactions with the ""old gang"" of knuckleballers is great, don't get me wrong, but there are WAY too many slo-mo shoots of fluttering knucklers used simply to fill time/space.  The personal stories would have been compelling enough to explore even more fully.Overall, though, this is a fun little baseball documentary that is very professionally produced and doesn't try to ""ruffle feathers"" by making outrageous statements for publicity's sake.  It is clear that the filmmakers were truly interested in and inspired by their creation and that fact shows in the final product.",1372118400,2013-06-25

5.0,"Although there have been comparisons to Blair Witch (pfft) and even Cloverfield, those movies fell well short of expectations whereas this one excelled. The characters are all quite engaging and believable, and the plot is believable, in a fictitious sort of way. There are so many underlying messages about government and society (at least as pertains to Norway specifically, but to the world at large as well), that i wont even bother regaling you with my views there. Suffice to say that this movie doesnt rely on unseen foes and hidden agendas. You actually see the trolls, and bare witness to the protagonists dealing with the situations, as a college filmcrew finds, then follows, then joins with an official government troll hunter/preservationist. Kind of a zookeeper with much larger confines that sometimes has to become a hunter as well. I would definitely recommend watching this, unless you cant keep up with subtitles for some reason, in which case, you wont like this. However, it is my experience that within the first few minutes, you forget you're even reading them as you become completely engaged with the story. Watch this movie...and enjoy!",1316563200,2011-09-21

3.0,"This sequel starts off promising with a series of bloggers discussing the authenticity of the original GRAVE ENCOUNTERS...sort of a parody within a parody.  One blogger, an aspiring filmmaker, believes the found footage is real, and wants to go to the hospital to prove it.  Ironically, this novice director is working on a slasher movie, another overworked genre.  Anyway, the first half of GE2 looks like a potentially effective sequel, but the appearance of a character from the original film sends the movie on a downward spiral it doesn't recover from.The Vicious Brothers wrote the script but didn't direct this time.  It's disappointing to see a potentially good sequel disintegrate so easily.  Let's hope this ends the franchise.",1363305600,2013-03-15

2.0,"I tried three times to watch this series, but I cannot get past the first episode, where the main characters (who remember, we are all supposed to be able to relate to)lie, cheat, steal, assault, bilk, pilfer, pickpocket, participate in vehicular homicide and then escape to a life of the super-rich. No, they all should have just been caught, arrested, tried and thrown in prison, end of series.I love Eddie Izzard as a comedian and as an actor, but this series simply crosses my ethical lines; you do not make heroes out of villains, you just don't send that message to the world, unless you make it clear that what you are promoting and supporting and suggesting EVIL as a justified way of life. Just because they are part of an even worse criminal element, that does not forgive them for their actions, which they never have to face, that does not give the producers the right to present an upside-down morality play as if it were OK to just kill someone, take over their life, impersonate them, and go about your business as if nothing evil happened, or that it wasn't your fault.So I'll just prop the soapbox up over here and quietly walk away, while you figure out why you want to watch bad people get away with bad things.",1359244800,2013-01-27

It sounded like yet another 'risque' show and it didnt sound that interesting but I was wrong. I caught the last ten minutes of an episode and that was more than enough. I went to iTunes and one by one, I bought the entire first season. Yes, it is very honest and holds no punches and has tons of sex but it is also the best written show ive seen this past year. It is never dull and has some very shocking, and hilarious, moments throughout. This is strictly for adults, though, and that is no exaggeration.I would give Emmys to the show, to Duchovny, to McElhone (who recently lost her husband, my sympathies to her and her family) and the writers and some supporting nods.If you dont mind frank talk, then you will love this show.",1211414400,2008-05-22

This version is darker and has more edge than the first series. The younger sister started out slightly shallow, but the need of having her watched by older adults was addressed early on in the series Now I think that both ""sisters"" are developing their sibling roles nicely. The actors that support Michelle Ryan have developed into a fine ensemble of people. I would like to see more of Mark Sheppard in future episodes. There are also danglers of plot in each episode. I hope the show continues. It has turned out to be a show I look forward to watching on my PC.",1198368000,2007-12-23
5.0,"Chick Flick Alert! No one can do them better than director Nick Cassevetes (""The Notebook"") when he's in the mood. Working with writer Melissa Stack in her first full-length project (I'll keep an eye out for this talented gal), this pair knows how to deliver a punch straight to where we live. This guilty pleasure is a perfect showcase for the hilarious Leslie Mann and the fearless Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (in a wild departure from ""Game of Thrones""), but the others are laugh-out-loud funny, too.Being a successful lady killer can have its perils when the ladies involved are:* Cameron Diaz (""Bad Teacher"") as Carly, as successful attorney betrayed by her lover...* Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Headhunters"") Mark, who is the irresistibly handsome Lothario married to...* Leslie Mann (""This is 40"") Kate. After an initial rough patch, the wife and the mistress quickly discover that he is also courting...* Kate Upton (""Tower Heist"") Amber, who feels betrayed when a fourth woman is spotted being seduced by this three-timer.* Nicki Minaj (""Ice Age"" voice) is Lydia, the brassy secretary who tells Carly that ""liars live longer.""* Don Johnson (""Machete"") is Carly's proud father, often married, rarely sorry.It is clear that we are in good hands when the movie opens with a gorgeous aerial shot of New York City and Etta James singing ""I Want a Sunday Kind of Love."" ...sigh...Rated PG-13, you will see no nudity and hear no profanity, but there are several segments where the women get drunk together.

4.0,"""Glee: Season 1"" is an exceptional show. ""Glee"" is a high school drama, soap opera, and comedy about the agony and the ecstasy of being a teenager, with great music. Although the show has rapid fire broad comedy and classic pop songs, at its core is a group of sympathetic misfits that pull on your heartstrings. ""Glee"" is closer to being ""Freaks & Geeks"" than it is ""The O.C."". Though there is a lot of soap opera melodrama, like ""Ugly Betty"", this is no vacuous teen drama about pretty rich kids, but neither is it a fringe curiosity. ""Glee"" is about kids on the outside looking to be part of something that they enjoy, and it's very enjoyable to watch them strive.

4.0,"Meeting Evil surprised the hell out of me! When I read the description, I wasn't all that interested, but because Samuel L. Jackson was in it, I figured I'd give it twenty minutes or so, and I'm glad I did! This dark, independent, thriller was one of the most edgy, exciting films I've seen all year. Luke Wilson plays John, a man down on his luck. Suddenly, a stranger comes knocking at his door, and that leads to an unbelievable chain of events that ends with a twist that you will never see coming. Jackson is terrific as always, whether he's the good guy or the bad guy, he's always so entertaining and always manages to call someone racist, I love that! As for his co-star, Luke Wilson, I kept waiting for his character to open up, to have some kind of reaction to what was happening, but he doesn't, still his performance was a strong one. What I really liked about this film was how you really didn't know what was going to happen next. It seems like a small thing, but very few films like this go to such extremes and turn out to be so unpredictable. I can honestly say, when that twist was revealed at the end, I almost fell out of my chair. Yes, Meeting Evil is an independent film, but its better than any thriller that's come out this year. The acting is terrific, the story will have you on the edge of your seat, and just when you think you've got it all figured out, you find out that you don't know a thing. This was a tremendous movie that fell way under the radar, but I found it, and you should most definitely check it out for yourself.",1361491200,2013-02-22

1.0,"The town of Chester's Mill is sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible dome. The inhabitants - and various visitors - have to manage dwindling supplies and social disorder whilst trying to figure out how to escape.We live in a golden age of television, with TV shows pushing further in crafting excellent narratives and creating compelling characters out of even the most mundane of situations. Rising budgets and production values mean that TV shows now often look like movies, sometimes with big movie stars opting for the less-lucrative but more creatively and artistically rewarding opportunities to slowly explore and develop characters over hours and maybe years. It's a great time to be a TV fan.Under the Dome therefore stands as a stark warning that we should not be complacent or overconfident that this is a state that will last forever. Under the Dome is a horrible show, so terrible that on a fundamental level all involved with it must know how bad it is, and therefore can only have made it deliberately as a warning to others to stay on the ball and avoid this show's pitfalls.Under the Dome is based on Stephen King's quite excruciatingly awful novel of the same name, but in a move that is actually impressive, is awful for completely different reasons. The primary weaknesses of King's novel - the ludicrous implausibility at how quickly everything disintegrates and its unhealthy obsession with raping Twilight fans (seriously Stephen, we know you're a Harry Potter fan but that's just juvenile) - are fortunately missing from the TV show. Brian K. Vaughan - the man credited with saving Lost from a dip in form during its early third season - has great credentials and is a good enough writer to know what to change from the book (i.e. almost everything apart from the dome itself and a few character names) to make it work on TV. But pretty much none of it does work.The biggest problem is the total lack of decent, compelling characters. Our main lead appears to be Dale 'Barbie' Barbara, but he is a rather unsympathetic killer and thug. Actor Mike Vogel initially gives it his all, but after a couple of episodes seems to realise that the inexplicable lurches in his character's motivations aren't going away and decides to sleep-walk through the rest of the series. Rachelle Lefevre also gamely engages with her character of Julia before realising she doesn't have a character, just a cliche (unconventional journalist from out of town with totally amazing hair), and likewise phones it in. The young kids are more enthusiastic and get some credit for being the only people in town actually bothered about what the dome is and where it came from, but their lack of experience and some poor direction results in them lurching from painfully over-acting to massively underselling big moments.There are some good points in the cast. Natalie Martinez's character of Linda has some bizarre character turns and is rather gullible at times, but she at least just about manages to sell the idea of a character cracking up from the stress of the situation (whether that was the aim or not). Dean Norris also brings some much-needed charisma to the antagonistic role of 'Big Jim' Rennie, even if some of his quite astonishing lines are delivered through teeth hugely gritted as he tries to forget he went from filming Breaking Bad to this mess (a drop in quality only comparable to Natalie Portman appearing in Black Swan and then Your Highness). However, the good work of others is undone by Alexander Koch as Junior. His utter lack of acting talent and the way he seems to have only three stand-by expressions he moves between, sometimes randomly, is almost hypnotic. It's certainly the worst performance by a regular in a TV series that I've seen in many, many years.The writing is also awful. Brian K. Vaughan has some seriously good work to his name, but he seems unable to employ it here. Dialogue is expositionary, unconvincing and wooden in the extreme. You can predict how entire scenes will go - sometimes down to lines - from their opening moments. The show also starts back-pedalling from its premise - a bunch of people trapped together in a dome - immediately by periodically bringing in new characters and unconvincingly explaining they've been in hiding since the dome came down. When the writing doesn't even have the courage to deal with the basic premise of the show, there's a huge problem.Under the Dome's first season (*) is almost irredeemably bad. The writing is almost completely bad, the acting is mostly bad, very little about it (from character motivations to the supply situation to the utter lack of contact with the outside world after the third or fourth episode) makes any kind of sense and the whole thing feels like a big, dead, inert weight. A few flashes of competence from a couple of the actors are the only thing that makes watching it even remotely bearable. Still, it's a vast improvement on the novel.",1385596800,2013-11-28

4.0,"I haven't watched the first season in its entirety, but I have watched enough episodes to have a grasp on the show and material. I was first heard about this through a lifetime teaser, which sucked because I didn't have the lifetime channel. When I found out it was on netflix, I got all excited and hoped it would live up to my expectations. Usually things fall far short from how they first appear, but this series has kept me interested and entertained the entire time.Details: The show starts out with a supermodel (Deb, I believe) who is extremely vain and couldn't picture herself as anything but a size 0, maybe 2, and is one of those ""beautiful people"". The word superficial definitely comes to mind. Due to an accident involving a truck and some grapefruit, which seems like a pretty bad way to die in my opinion, she makes her way up to a purgatory type locale. When trying to decide where her fate lies, she takes matters into her own hands and presses the ""return"" button on her guardian angel's keyboard. This sends her back to Earth but as Jane, a super intelligent lawyer with a heart of gold and a bit of extra weight. Basically, almost the exact opposite of Deb. The show helps Deb (in Jane's body) with several realizations that life is about more than just looks.Drama: To add an extra layer to everything, it turns out that Deb's fiance actually works for the same law firm as Jane. Oh how cruel fate can be... And while he is still grief stricken, he has shown some interest in one of their coworkers, much to Jane/Deb's dismay.Why 4 out of 5 stars then, you ask? It really ticked me off in the first few episodes when Jane was stressed and her assistant would feed her cheeze whiz straight out of a can or give her a doughnut to improve her mood. It almost seemed like the show was saying ""bigger women love to do these types of things, that's why they are bigger"". It was totally unnecessary and inconsiderate.",1333065600,2012-03-30

5.0,"Hard to review this documentary. It is absolutely compelling as a chronicle of american social history for the time.

Also, it is absolutely amazing how other similar ""gurus"" of the age travelled through the same narrative arc that is described in this documentary, heck, even the symbolic head of the most popular religion in western civilization.

4.0,"For years, the infamous `what if?' scenario has played into the themes central to hundreds if not thousands of films, books, and television programs.  Indeed, what would ABC TV's program ""Lost"" been without more than its fair share of `what ifs'?  It's become a bit of a gimmick for motion pictures in the last decade or so, perhaps a bit overused, but BLACKTHORN takes a swing at it and gives it another play for its worth: what if Butch Cassidy never died at the end of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and, instead, lived out the remainder of his days in quiet solitude?  While that may not seem the most glamorous spin at speculative fiction - nor a foundation for the most daring Western adventure ever - BLACKTHORN ends up being a bit greater than the sum of its small parts, and that's no doubt due in large part to the inclusion of Sam Shepard in the titular role as the aging bank robber hoping for one, great legitimate score to give him enough money to return back home before he withers away.It seems the Kid and Sundance didn't die when the Mexican `federales' came for them; curiously, they were able to sneak out the back, but not without the Kid suffering a fatal gunshot wound.  Once he puts his friend in the ground, Cassidy changes his name to James Blackthorn, and he takes up residence raising prize horses in Bolivia.  As luck would have it, Blackthorn learns that his and the Kid's flame from their lawless days - Etta Place - gave birth to a young man that could've been a son or a nephew, for all he knows, and the retired train robber keeps up his correspondence with the boy.  Eventually, Blackthorn wants to see his home again before he dies, so he sells off a last round of horses to a big haul of money ... only to lose it all after the fleeing accountant-turned-thief, Eduardo Apodaca (played by Eduardo Noriega), unsuccessfully tries to rob him of his horse.  In exchange for helping Apodaca avoid capture from the posse of vigilantes fast on his trail, Blackthorn will receive half of the man's haul ... if they both can survive long enough to claim it.Therein lies the `what if' and the cruel irony at the heart of BLACKTHORN's story: the man must embrace the kind of life he long ago left behind in order to make that last big score.  Certainly, the irony doesn't stop there, as the vigilantes not only close the distance separating them but also their identities turn out to be something that not even Blackthorn could've ever suspected.  It's a startling revelation for the man who's lived a life of hard truths, and it runs parallel to the premise as laid out by the aging robber's narration: ""There are only two significant events in a man's life: when you leave home and when you go back. Everything else is just the middle.""  It seems that Butch Cassidy can never quite escape `the middle' as he so desperately wishes to do, even when that means running up against an aging Pinkerton agent (a wonderful little cameo-style role, played by Stephen Rea).  The two men are long past their prime, and, if they're not careful, Apodaca will be the death of them both.Frankly, it's the kind of role an actor has to wait a lifetime to play, and Shepard fills the cowboy boots to great effect.  He entirely looks the part - a tremendous asset as opposed to aging a much younger actor under layers of make-up - of Butch Cassidy with his leathered creases and wise eyes.  There's still a spark of wit in Cassidy as he trades verbal barbs with the noticeably younger Noriega, taunting and teasing the man whose life he's saved in exchange for half of the man's stash.As westerns go, BLACKTHORN is very solid.  It's filmed in striking locations, edited smartly, and put together in a first rate production.  All of the players - including Dominique McElligott in the all-too-briefly-seen Etta Place (she can be seen recently in AMC TV's equally entertaining oater, ""Hell on Wheels"") - hit their marks.  The writing is sharp, if not a bit too predictable toward the climax, which ties up a bit too neatly for my tastes.  Still, it's a winner that deserves to be seen by a wider audience, and no doubt western enthusiasts like myself will find plenty to celebrate here.Highly recommended.",1327968000,2012-01-31

4.0,"Like 2011's ""Margin Call"", ""Arbitrage"" is a film that exploits the public's fascination with the world of high finance following the global economic crisis. Both films were written and directed by sons of Wall Street traders, who grew up in that environment. Unlike ""Margin Call"", ""Arbitrage"" does not attempt to say much about the financial world, much less the financial crisis. Instead, ""Arbitrage"" is a character study of a hedge fund manager whose world comes crashing down in the wake of bad decisions and bad luck. Robert Miller (Richard Gere) is a self-made magnate, owner of Miller Capitol, who finds himself in need of a lot of cash after an investment in a Russian copper mine is tied up by regulatory laws and foreign bureaucracy. He needs to sell his company to Standard Bank & Trust, and he has borrowed $412 million to plug the holes in his books until the sale. In the meantime, tragedy strikes when his mistress is killed in an accident that could derail the whole deal.Robert Miller is a relatively common name, but it happens to be the name of a real billionaire who made his fortune in duty-free shops and whose daughters frequently grace the society pages. I thought this was a strange coincidence. There is no relation to Robert Miller of the film. Miller is an energetic, domineering man who worked his way from the middle class to a Gramercy Park mansion, a stylish wife (Susan Sarandon) who occupies herself with endless charity functions, a grown son and daughter who work at his company, and an exotic artist-mistress whom he sponsors. He has a lot on his shoulders, and suddenly it all goes to pot. He can't tell anyone. He must cope the way he knows best: wheel and deal and exude confidence. Will he land on his feet? Do we want him to? He's not a bad guy, but he's not especially likeable either. He is no more or less ethical than average. Richard Gere has played this role before, notably in ""Unfaithful"", a more sophisticated film.There's nothing original here, but the cast is good. There is a practical, world-weary wife. A temperamental mistress who craves attention. A morally superior but nave daughter. A son who has proven to be a disappointment. It's unfortunate that Susan Sarandon does not have more to do. Tim Roth steals his scenes as a crooked, desperate police detective. A stereotype, yes, but Roth makes him menacing. Nate Parker is sympathetic as a young man to whom Miller turns for help and who ends up in a very bad spot on account of it. On one hand, I felt that there should be more to this story. And the police investigation into the accident strains credibility. On the other hand, stock characters are not a bad way to begin a career in filmmaking. This is Nicholas Jarecki's first effort at directing a feature and second screenwriting effort. ""Arbitrage"" looks good. And the cast elevates a hackneyed script into an entertaining and suspenseful character study.The DVD (Lionsgate 2012): There are 6 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary. ""A Glimpse into Arbitrage"" (12 min) interviews the film's producers, director Nicholas Jarecki, and several members of the cast about the ideas behind the film and its locations. ""Who Is Robert Miller?"" (7 min) interviews the cast and director about the Miller character and Gere's performance. There is an audio commentary by writer/director Nicholas Jarecki, who explains how he came to be interested in making films, this film's conception, trials in getting it made, and eventually gets around to commenting on the actual film. He goes into detail about Miller's financial situation, his character, and the motivation of characters, as well as some technical details. Comment is constant but not always about what's on screen.

But after watching it with my son for about the 3rd or 4th time, I saw that he made sense out of the show.  I like the premise and creative elements such as the 'finding place.'  But the teaching (lesson to be learned or discovered) is very deliberate...there isn't much left to the 'imagination' as everything is constantly 'spelled out.'  My strongest comment is that this 'trial' episode appears to be an attempt to move very quickly to demonstrate the show's ultimate potential.  I think by moving a little slower and/or less 'spelling out of everything,' a little more imagination is stirred.  I do however, like the characters...they are refreshing.  I especially like the portions that aren't in the heavy or vibrantly colored cartoon mode...from an adult's perspective, the animated segments are more appealing.",1391990400,2014-02-10

3.0,"Not least because of Johannson's lovely person, but those are brief scenes. Seeing her floating in darkness or against the rugged Scottish terrain, seeing the face of her last victim and even her own face looking back at her and blinking, all contribute to intensity of imagery that's hard to beat. It supports the cryptic plot and dark ambience, where Scarjo forms the first link in the chain that abducts men (and only men) for purposes unknown. The mood develops throughout the film, as Scarjo's character seems to crumble from within.But, in the end, it's only mood, with barely a plot to point to and more left unresolved than not. This must be the most ambiguous SF film sinceThe Man Who Fell to Earth. Even that, to my eye, spoke in a clearer voice than this, and that movie is not known for clarity.Visually strong, but even that strength isn't enough to pull this one together.-- wiredweird",1398816000,2014-04-30

4.0,"It's hard to watch how childish people are.  How we humans get through a disaster, baffles me.  99% of the sheeple just complain and steal and complain, no one rising to the occasion, everyone yelling my brother my father my sister my children, parochial.So I don't wonder this series only lasted two seasons.  The mirror, hurts.Most poignant in the first episode is the narrow-minded mother who accuses the mayor of not knowing what it's like to have your kid 'out there', when in fact Jake is 'out there', and his dad the mayor, doesn't know if he's still alive.  But he has no luxury to think about that, to cry, to worry.But oh, that mother thinks she's supposed to yell at the mayor, to be a good mother.  Instead, she's not only a bad mother, but a bad human being, heedless of anyone but her own ego.  She obviously doesn't even care about her kids;  because if she did, she'd be trying to help, not yelling.Hope someone will redo the series, for we need to see how hypocritical, parochial and ill-prepared we are, to assemble and think through a crisis, always expecting someone else to handle it;  always uninterested in the big picture, uninterested in doing something ourselves, always ready to blame someone else, never paying attention.It was always 'cool' to pay little attention in school.  Only the bad guys run things.  To be disinterested in anything but one's narrow circle, is supposed to be a virtue.  Yeah, and this is what we get for such bad attitudes.So this series really focuses on WHY war occurs.  Dark lesson never learned.

5.0,"This is a classic interpretation of my favorite of Jane Austen's novels: PRIDE & PREJUDICE.  The title describes the attitude of the superior and cold Mr. Darcy (and the aristocrats) who considers himself above the country folk and Bennet family of Elizabeth Bennet.  But early on in this film, you see Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) become attracted to Elizabeth's (Jennifer Ehle) beauty, intelligence, independence and spirit.  She doesn't fawn over him like most.Strong performances by Elizabeth's father, Mr. Bennett (Benjamin Whitrow), Charlotte (Lucy Scott), Collins (David Bamber) stand out to me.  Elizabeth's mother was annoying and her voice grated as it is supposed to according to the plot of the book.  It's wonderful that this novel is serialized in this mini-series so you get all the nuances of the story which a 90-minute movie can't do justice to.It's marvelous seeing the architecture and interiors of Georgian and Regency rooms.  The antiques are wonderful as are the costumes. It seemed this film had a bit of a greenish cast, especially the interior scenes.  Don't know if anyone else noticed that.

2.0,"I really liked the idea of getting kids thinking about inventions and how things work, but then the rest of the show talks down to them with low-brow humor. The timing or editing was also off. It was like watching a high school play where everyone was assigned a part without having auditions. There are some good child actors in the cast with potential and the idea of the maker subculture sounds great. Keep the projects realistic and don't dumb it down with toilet humor and it could be saved.",1391731200,2014-02-07

3.0,"I think I would have either added a few more episodes, or cut the time spent on  the musical number and Robert Carne's memories of his sad relationship with his lovely but bi-polar wife. The story line that involved Sarah Burton as the young, emancipated headmistress including the subplot with her pupil, the poverty stricken but gifted Lydia, was so much more promising and fresh. With Carne, I felt we were given raked over Mr Rochester, by way [ and it is not the fault the versatile actor David Morissey, he strongly resembles George Reeves in this role] of Superman. I could barely concentrate because of it. Too bad because this series could have been wonderful. Anna Maxwell Martin, a most intelligent actress, is, as usual,  a delight.",1372723200,2013-07-02
4.0,"Hell On Wheels - The Complete First Season (2011)I stumbled upon this show by complete accident not being a regular TV viewer. I saw the title featured on Amazon and recalled seeing that term used in the book ""Nothing Like It in the World"", Stephen Ambrose's history of the trans-continental railroad. The term described the nomadic towns that sprang up and accompanied the construction of the nations railroads. I impulsively purchased the First Season and submit the following observations.I was very impressed with the sets, location and, of course, the rolling stock - trains. Having resided in the mid-west for several years - Minnesota - the Canadian prairies looked very authentic to me.From my reading the rail towns were, in fact, lawless and vice was rampant. The survivors of the Civil War, both Union and Confederates were attracted to the wide-open lifestyle. Outward expressions of racial and ethnic enmity was part of the then American culture. Of course dramatic liberties were taken but the basic social interactions portrayed reflect, I believe, the situations, as they actually existed.The actors were unknown to this viewer but were memorable for their roles particularly ""The Swede"" and Joseph Black Moon.One real attractive aspect of the box set are the behind the scenes documentaries that are included. One fact that impressed me no end was that the locomotive used in Season One was made out of wood!I just purchased Season 2 so you know I'll give this series a good rating!",1379030400,2013-09-13

3.0,I don't have really a beef with this show. Other than these people are really doing this. I do think that being prepared is important. But to go to this extent is a little extreme in my eyes. and it's kind of frightening some of the things that these people are doing. the amount of firearms shown in the homes is disturbing.

3.0,"Anybody who has seen &#34;Heroes&#34; will immediately know the basic outlines of this show. It's about a group of humans with superpowers who fight criminals, but with an attempt to make the superheroes more realistic rather than like comic book characters.The show is entertaining. It never really rises to greatness though. Three things held it back. First, it seems too familiar, almost like a &#34;Heroes Lite.&#34; There's nothing that really makes the show stick out, except perhaps David Strathairn, who defies the stereotypes as an elderly, kindly leader who lacks superpowers.Second, the show never seemed like it was going anywhere. Like a modern serials, which seem obsessed with continuity, the show keeps dropping hints about a bigger mystery but seldom provides resolution. Some villains disappear from the picture without use even knowing who they were or why they were such a threat. We do get some character development, especially with the female characters, but the male characters seem stuck in place. Some characters seem to just pop up once or twice but don't seem to really drive anything further.Finally, the ensemble doesn't fully work. There are a lot of things I like about the characters. They seem much more real and grounded than most TV sci-fi characters. Also, I'm glad they didn't choose a bunch of supermodels for all of the roles (the actors are attractive but not supermodels). Individually, the characters work pretty well.Unfortunately, collectively it seems like there are cliques, as if they don't all work as a team. The show seemed to have trouble finding good situations for the male and female characters to work together. Some pairings worked (like Bill and Gary), but rather than following a team I almost felt like I was watching several small groups with a loose connection to each other.Overall, I'd recommend the show for fans of dramatic sci-fi (or if you loved &#34;Heroes&#34;), but go in with realistic expectations.",1391817600,2014-02-08

3.0,"The film deals with the age old conflict of control of natural resources. In this case an international company called Clear-Bec runs water filtration systems. It makes deals with governments to take over the waterways used by the poor indigenous population, then turn around and sell them what has been free. Old progressives are familiar with this type of thing from Susan George's ""How the Other Half Dies"" (1976).In this particular case, the water in an Ecuadorian village becomes polluted with sewage and leads to a typhus epidemic which wipes out a village. Part of the damage control was to have the military ensure there were no witnesses. The incident is brought to the attention of Morgan Swinton (Deborah Kara Unger) part owner of the evil corporation. She has a conscience and wants to get to the bottom of the incident against the wishes of her brother and the rest of the company.She hires radio talk show host and former CIA agent Jack Begosian (Andy Garcia) who used to work on the other side of these types of issues. For him it is a chance for redemption and to bury those demons. His goal is to bring back the only witness, an activist who has the secret files of what happened, Francisco Francis (Forest Whitaker).The film is about a fictional corporation doing things that are not beyond the realm of reason, until they bring the fight home, then I had to scratch my head. Personally I would have liked to seen a dramatization of a certain soft drink company who we all know and love and their involvement with the assassination of union leaders in Columbia.Andy Garcia and Forest Whitaker are typically animated characters in stories. In this movie they are rather subdued and defined more by their philosophical ramblings than actions. The plot was fairly simple without any real twist. The final shoot out I found grossly unbelievable. I never got to experience the pain of the affected people, nor did I develop any type connection with the main character whose past, which was fundamental to understanding him, was not fully explained. Not as good as Sean Connery in the Amazon Rain Forest.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Killing, some blood not overly graphic.",1354924800,2012-12-08

3.0,"This isn't quite a rom-com because there really isn't much going on that is funny, but it's not really a drama. It's two people trying to work out their lives together.Here's the scoop. Tim (Chris Messina) is a street performer who's girl just took a hike. Janice (Jenna Fischer) just lost her job because she's not personable enough. So she's living with her sister and brother-in-law till she gets squared away. Her sister is pushing jer into a relationship with an obnoxious author (Topher Grace) of self help type books. Happenstance lands both Janice and Tim jobs at the local zoo where a relationship starts between them. Will they find themselves, love and happiness?This struck me as a shrewd exercise in casting. Chris Messina is always good and very easy in front of the camera. He doesn't disappoint here. But Too many of the other characters seemed to be here because of their success in other currently notable shows. Fischer from ""The Office."" Rich Sommer from ""Madmen."" Bob Odenkirk form ""Breaking Bad."" It all seemed a bit too calculated. Anyway....this is all just okay. Fischer is supposed to be someone trying to find herself an her place in the world but the way she's written she comes off as being dull and dull witted. Her hidden talent (which was wedged in with a crowbar) comes out of the blue. And Messina, who you like as a person, seems to have no particular talent at all. His one saving grace is that he works to evolve his Giant Mechanical Man street character and does succeed at it. Too much of what happens in the film seems too pat. It were as though they needed to take a little of this and put it here and a little of that and put it there. One crucial scene, where things come to a head between Fischer and her sister was clunky. It was written, acted and directed poorly. I like Jenna Fischer. She's just a super doll, but I think we've seen everything she can do in ""The Office."" She didn't have the gravity to pull it off.This is a decent enough watch. It won't change your life, but you like these people and root for them. That's a good enough reason to see it.",1381104000,2013-10-07

Director Woo was out to Wow and he succeeded.  Don't skip the credits.  The cast and crew of this film make the old DeMille &#34;cast of thousands&#34; look sadly understaffed.

5.0,"Growing up as a child of the 1980&#8242;s. VHS was my life. Every Friday night I would hop on my bike after school and head down to the local video store with the largest selection of horror movies. I&#8217;d run to the back of the store where the &#8220;really good&#8221; horror movies were and enjoy the bloody feast of gory eye candy. It was a rush of adrenaline that every horror fan should experience regularly. The painted covers, the delicious puns, the bonanza of blood! Ohhh, they were some good times.Watching the new documentary Rewind This! brought back these incredible memories with a glorious gory grin on my face through the entire 92 minute running time. Directed by Josh Johnson, Rewind This! tells the story of the 80&#8242;s VHS boom, the collectors today that are still holding on to their VHS collection, and the future for the medium. Filled with interviews from collectors as well as filmmakers from the era, the documentary has a lot of fun showing the power VHS has over fans even today. Want some vintage VCR commercials? Oh, believe me, they are all here. I especially loved the commercials that feature the state of the art &#8220;cordless remote feature&#8221; as well as the cutting edge &#8220;rewind option.&#8221; It&#8217;s a nostalgia lovers wet dream as is some of the rare VHS tapes featured.As the doc moves on to the world of today&#8217;s cinema and the advent of streaming video, it plays as a bit of a heartbreak for horror fans. One film professor mentions how her students have no desire today to start a video collection as anything they could ever want to see is available on streaming. How sad is that? Early VHS was an artform in and of itself and film lovers of the new generation are surely missing something with the lack of a physical medium. This film understands that and celebrates the great years with great enthusiasm. This is a fantastic documentary for the film lover in all of us. Check it out!",1389657600,2014-01-14

There is a genuine, authentic side to the humor, no matter how improbable, and all of it reminds me of drinking a steaming cup of milky latte at my favorite caf&eacute;.

She meets Claude (Aneurin Barnard) a boy who understands her and emulates her ability to lie.When Linda (Jessica Biel) moves in with her baby next door, Emanuel offers to babysit a woman who becomes her mother figure to the dismay of her step mom (Frances O'Connor) who worries Emanuel may be attracted to women. If for some reason you weren't engaged in the film, at 22 minutes you will be, as Linda has her own issues and secrets that Emanuel indulges her and protects her.The film comes full circle as do most indies of this caliber. I would recommend NOT reading a lot of reviews as one might reveal the plot spoiler early in the film, i.e. at 22 minutes, that really must be experienced.This is not a film for everyone.

He then asks one favor of Dracula, to help him in his quest for revenge. It turns out the two ""men"" have the same group of enemies who go back to ancient times. Now, we find Dracula living in London, England trying to stop the powerful economic barons who are blood relatives of his ancient enimies. This is the same ""secret society"" that burned his first wife to death in Medieval times. To make the plot even more interesting, Dracula recognizes a lovely young English woman who looks exactly like his murdered wife. Now, he must hire her fiancee to keep her nearer to him. What will happen when Dracula tries to explain his re-emerging love for her? Is she really his wife returned to him as foretold in the old prophecy of reincarnation? Can Dracula first ""remove"" the evil ringleaders, who are finally convinced that their forefathers' enemy has returned, before they can trap and destroy Dracula and his comrades? An interesting twist on the famous old novel is having Dracula pose as a rich, young American businessman with a wonderful, new lighting invention which threatens the stranglehold his rivals have over the new gas-powered lighting industry.

4.0,"The one complaint that I have about the live action sequence is that the girl is in charge.  There's two reasons why I'm iffy on that, and it's not because of her sex per-se, but rather in the last fifteen years or so we've been been flooded with a lot of female leads who seem to do things better than the guys.  And the boy in this piece seems to fall into that category.  He needs to bring something with a little less slap stick to Anne and her robots.  I've had enough of males being the comedic sidekicks to female leads in all genres, and I think it would behoove this program not to fall into that trend in television.I'll also add that Anne needs a bit of supervision.  Not much, but some.  My knee jerk reaction is to give her a grandfather or uncle or big brother.  Or, to breach the male overseer stereotype, a woman with some technical savvy.  Someone; male or female, who can act as the safety break to explain to these kids why some experiments are good, and others aren't very safe.  That person doesn't need to be in every episode, but when it comes to experiments that have potential danger it might be good to bring that adult in to explain why said particular field of science is a little dicey.Anyway, I worked on feature films and a few TV shows in the 80s and 90s, and still write screenplays every now and then.  Take this little insight for what it's worth.In short; I'd back the project, but I'd also make the minor tweaks I suggested.p.s. throw in some other kids too",1366675200,2013-04-23
5.0,"I didn't think it possible that another TV show would create another relationship with so much chemistry as the one Mulder and Scully shared. This is the kind of relationship where two people are perfect together in every single way, they fight for each other, the save each other and you know, deep down, that they belong together. Oh, and the sexual tension is so obvious everyone knows about it! And even though you live for the glances, for the touch of the hand, for a single kiss (The Santa in the Slush), you are still hesitant to see them romantically together. You don't want to mess up a perfect thing.Season 3 sees a lot of changes, the Gormogon storyline; Brennan's father, Max, finally goes to trial, Both and Brennan go through some very interesting psych therapy, Jack and Angela look to find the name of her husband and the team experiences loss. Although short (15 episodes), the season was quite good, with tons of surprises, chaos, and plenty interesting cases. Great season.This season really delves into the Booth and Brennan relationship starting with Brennan's antagonistic feelings against Booth and her reluctance to go into the field or work with him directly. This is all a result of the events ofBones Second Season. Things gets solved and their relationship is fixed; just in time to solve the next case. This is a great crime-solving duo that works great together.",1221436800,2008-09-15

5.0,"I love this English TV show that focuses on the lives of many inhabitants of 2 small towns side by side in the Victorian era.  The characters are lively, loveable and their stories are heart warming, family centered and honest.  So many refreshing universal truths are emphasized in each episode. The writing is delightful!  I'm sure this was a huge hit in Europe.",1365811200,2013-04-13

5.0,"I didn't expect such a goofy episode to be big on character development, but my oh my poor Claudia. It makes complete sense that her deepest fear is that her life now, weird weird warehouse life, is just a figment of her mind. She came off as genuinely terrified, and I wanted her to be okay.I could have done without dufus calling the monster-Hannah ""Beotch"" and all of the lampshaded fanservice, but overall it was a good episode.",1315008000,2011-09-03
4.0,"You can't quite call this movie a suspense thriller, although there are certainly suspenseful scenes in it. What's that noise in the back of the medicine room? Who's there? Will he be caught?It's more of a quiet, intense character study. A young doctor becomes obsessed with one of his patients. When she is released from the hospital and seems likely to go flitting off with boyfriends, in social circles removed from him - he arranges to make her sick enough to have to come back to the hospital - to him. He does this in a sort of abstracted state of mind. We are never sure how far he really intends his sickening of the girl to go.But, for a while at least, he succeeds in making her his own, a saintly pallor of a girl transfixed on her hospital bed.This is a compelling, involving movie. It is brilliantly acted. Every character becomes starkly real on the screen - from the randy, self-seeking orderly - to the Doctor himself. If you like low-key malevolence, this is the movie for you.",1356134400,2012-12-22
4.0,"I love this show more than anything else I can think of on television these days.  The reason for the 4 stars is that, in episode 1, the winner of the competition should have been Laneysha Sparx instead of the overrated Roxxxy.  I may seem petty, but it was an extreme oversight in my opinion.  Also, cruel comments from the judges seem unnecessary.  I don't find RuPaul to be mean, but Santino and Michelle can be unkind.  When we hear the sad background stories of some of these contestants, maybe a little more kindness can be part of the critiques.  I realize that there are some major faux pas (whatever the plural is) committed by contestants.  They can be pointed out without excessive ridicule, I would think.  But I do love the show for the most part.  The contestants are wonderful.",1403913600,2014-06-28

1.0,"I waited eagerly for this film to come out.  The book was fabulous on so many levels. It asked thought provoking questions about the relationship between men and women, women and women, and humans and animals and it even included questions for discussion at the end. Everything that was intriguing or thought provoking in the book is missing. What replaces it is are shots of Scarlett Johansson staring into space, with and without clothes. Seriously, that is a major part of the film. This film goes beyond slow to tedious. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the story I'd read would suddenly burst forth...it never happened. You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.Perhaps the biggest initial turn-off was the choice of Johansson. In the book, Isserley was not a beautiful woman, having been (painfully) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick glasses she required to see on earth. That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable. They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone. The objectification of women was a large part of the story. Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment. Her alien insights were intriguing, something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.In the end, what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI. A group of alien men on motorcycles occasionally zip around to clean up any details left behind by her abductions but that is as action oriented as it gets. Forget this one...I already have.",1403740800,2014-06-26

3.0,"UNDER THE SKIN is a slow and cerebral, but intriguing sci-fi film with a stellar lead performance by Scarlett Johansson. Going into this, I had no idea what I was in for. All I knew was that Scarlett Johansson was playing some kind of alien who abducts men in Scotland. It turned out to be quite a bit more than that, although the snail's pace at which the film unfolded was a little taxing for me at times. Jonathan Glazer is an outstanding visualist and this film has some rather haunting combinations of images and music that create an unnerving atmosphere. Scarlett Johansson also does a great job as the enigmatic main character. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue in this film, which could put off some viewers, but sometimes what one sees is as or more important than what one hears. I'm not really sure how to describe what happens in the film at the risk of spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that you'll be rewarded if you can make it until the end. Stylistically, it reminded me a bit of a sci-fi film I watched before called BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW, inasmuch as the atmosphere created by the visuals and music combined are similar. Overall, I thought it was a decent film, although one that I'll probably wait awhile to watch again. I believe this has the potential to become a sci-fi classic, although it's likely to turn off a lot of viewers. Recommended, but be aware that this movie isn't for everyone.",1405123200,2014-07-12

This set contains the second 16 episodes from Season 3 and continues in chronological order where ""Volume 3"" leaves off.  They are releasing all the episodes just in instalments of 16 episodes.  And I think it's just fine considering the content you get for the price.

4.0,"Aww, man!  It's over.  This show was a thrill ride from the very beginning, to the very end.  I loved looking forward to how Scofield was gonna outsmart The Company every monday.  But unfortunately all good things must come to an end.  Prison Break season 4 is...interesting, to say the least.  If you are someone that watched from the start, you may be a little disappointed with how the show came to an end.  To me the last season was very unbalanced.  The writing was all over the place.  Starting with the re-emergence of Sarah and Scofield's sudden illness.  Plus how T-Bag after three seasons, develops a heart.  I'm sayin', come on!  Although I have to give all the actors credit for making entertainment out of what those wacky writers scripted.  I thought The General's performance was exceptional as usual!!! As well as Gretchen.  She is definitely a force to be reckoned with.  If you are someone that enjoys quality acting and intense drama than this is for you.  Prison Break will always be remembered by me.  It was a GREAT show with a very imaginative story line!!!!!!!!",1250121600,2009-08-13
3.0,"Set in Glasgow, ""Perfect Sense"" follows the story of a chef Michael (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist Susan (Eva Green) falling in love with other just when a strange epidemic spreads all over the world, depriving the people of the sense of smell. Things don't stop there, but people are resilient, as the film's voiceover says, ""life goes on.""This is a sci-fi romance with an unusual premise, or a modern-day parable beautifully-shot and well-acted, with a positive message about life, something that is also thought-provoking ... if you can ignore the film's pretentious and manipulative narrative.While director David Mackenzie manages to visualize the impending apocalypse effectively with minimum use of props, there is something artificial about the way the whole story is told. What if you lose your sense of smell? Pretty early on you will know where the film is trying to lead us to. ""Perfect Sense"" certainly does what it sets out to do confidently, even though I really don't care what is going on in this alternative universe of the emotionally distant film.Like some art house movies, ""Perfect Sense"" makes a point of showing what is obvious in a novel way.",1373760000,2013-07-14

5.0,"""Adventure Time Season 5"" contains 13 unique and lighthearted cartoon episodes.  The shows center around Finn and his trusted dog Jake (set in a colorful post apocalypse reality). With this edition being season 5, I would recommend novices of Adventure Time to check out the previous shows first (in order to more completely understand the theme and characters).  There are diverse messages in this series to appeal to men and women from various backgrounds. My personal favorite show from season 5 was Candy Streets due to both the ""who done it mystery element"" and the sense of spontaneous mission related exploration. Candy Streets is positively reminiscent of ""Mystery Train"" (from season 2).  Another alternative way to decide if this season is for you: Watch the free youtube showings of ""The Bravest Warriors"" from the Cartoon Hangover channel of Youtube. The reason for this recommendation: ""The Bravest Warriors"" animation and fun cartoon messages are similar to what you would get in ""Adventure Time Season 5"".",1379116800,2013-09-14

I feel like she wants to be on the up and up, but every time there is a new show, she is with some guy that she really shouldn't be with (the Lawyer, the undercover cop) they she doesn't disclose. So her whole purpose of trying to keep a relationship secret gets totally blown up and out in the open. Also I definately notice that she is a little more calm through out the activities, but I don't feel like she nows that law well enough to manipulate it to her advantage.

There is fine acting done in the depictions of Alice, the Knave of Hearts, the talking rabbit, Jaffar, and Cyrus.  However, my favorite character at the moment is that of the Red Queen played by Emma Rigby. This is because Rigby plays a queen that is both complex and keeps the character of Jaffar frequently guessing her next moves. I also like the costumes that were created for the Red Queen in episodes 1 and 2.  ""Once Upon A Time In Wonderland"" is perfect for those who enjoy fantasy television series.",1382140800,2013-10-19

5.0,"I wasn't expecting this show to be this good. The writing is great and the storylines are engaging, as are the characters. The acting is spot on. All to be expected from a Rockne O'banion production. So if you liked FARSCAPE or FIREFLY you're gonna love this, but don't get too attached to it.

5.0,"The first time I saw this show was in Shanghai China, it was playing on the only English speaking TV station I could find, and I thought it was OK. Later I decided to buy a season and try it out - I'm always hungry for good comedies and they are few and far between. It turns out now to be one of my favorites shows.

3.0,"If you haven't watched all the Hannibal movies it's probably a better show than I give it credit for. It is a little hard to have watched the movies where the plot refers to his past crimes. Then the show takes his crimes and assigns them to other people. Where now he is helping catch the people. For example in the movie he kills the man in the orchestra for playing bad. In the show another man kills him to make a violin out of him. Also the main character of the show isn't Hannibal. It is Will Graham who is the prequel to silence of the lambs. That movie is Manhunt. In that movie Will is a strong character in this show he is a weak deranged great thinker, and Hannibal has been turned from Anthony Hopkins who portrayed power, to a much leaner man who doesn't look like he would have the strength to carry out the deeds that Hannibal Lector performed. I am watching the show because it is better than most of the things on TV these days. You will probably enjoy it if your not really into the movies. To wrap up not for children. Plenty of blood.",1395964800,2014-03-28

Reggie isn't intellectually stimulated by his position in the grooming industry even though he is good at it.

4.0,"In &#34;Big Bad Wolves,&#34; a sadistic killer is on the loose who targets young girls. As if violating and torturing the girls before killing them wasn't enough, this twisted individual likes to decapitate his victims; sometimes while they're still awake and conscious and prefers to use a rusty saw. Israeli police officer Mickey (Lior Ashkenazi) is put on the case, but likes to do whatever it takes to get what he's looking for even if that means doing something that's frowned upon by the commissioner Tsvika (Dvir Benedek). After questioning a teacher named Dror (Rotem Keinan) and beating him senseless, a Youtube video of the incident goes viral and Mickey is stripped of his duties. But Mickey is convinced Dror is still the prime suspect and pursues his one lead as a civilian with nothing to lose. Meanwhile, Gidi (Tzahi Grad) is the man whose daughter was the most recent victim in this heinous string of murders and is making his own preparations for how he'll cope with the loss of his daughter.This Israeli thriller begins with a game of hide and seek portrayed in slow-motion and played by what looks like three teenagers (two girls and one boy) in a broken down and abandoned house. One of the girls goes missing and only a red shoe is found in her hiding place as the title of the film is seen on the roof as the camera pans out. You're introduced to the incredible score of the film early on and it seems to be boasting in a way in how triumphant it sounds. After the first five minutes of the film, the music backs off yet is always lurking in the background and tapping at the window. It's as if the music of &#34;Big Bad Wolves&#34; is always huffing and puffing and pounding to be let in.While the film is extremely dark, as you can probably imagine, there's also a lot of black comedy thrown in to lighten things up a little. When Tsvika first calls Mickey into his office, it's bring your kid to work day and Tsvika's son is sitting there while Tsvika scolds Mickey parroting everything he says. Doval'e Glickman portrays Yoram, Gidi's father, and the back and forth conversations Glickman and Grad have between each other at the most inopportune moments are fairly amusing. There's a scene where Yoram and Gidi are upstairs in the kitchen eating soup. The scene is very calm and serene. The two of them are talking about how wonderful Gidi's mother's cooking is. But what's taking place below them is much more hectic and grim. Then there's the scene where a man is interested in buying a house and has the real estate agent scream at the top of her lungs while he's walking around upstairs. There's this very lighthearted twist at times that makes something very dark extremely easy to digest and enjoy.&#34;Big Bad Wolves&#34; is a thriller that keeps you guessing. The viewer is left contemplating whether Dror is guilty of these crimes or an innocent man and when you think your mind is made up the film makes your brain shift in the opposite direction. The cinematography is very simple and yet beautiful. Something straightforward like an actor sitting on a bench is shown completely blurry at first, but slowly comes into focus as the camera crawls up on the actor. The inside of the house where nearly half of the film takes place has these glorious mahogany walls and floors that seem to shine whenever they're showcased and the long, narrow corridor that leads to the room where a man is looking for retribution makes you tense and gives you the shivers.There are very light shades of Thomas Vinterberg's &#34;The Hunt&#34; in &#34;Big Bad Wolves&#34; and while the content is incredibly horrific and gruesome not much of it is shown on screen. The film knows when to pull back and seems to know that less is more in that sense. It's very similar to the original &#34;The Human Centipede&#34; film in the sense that while disgusting situations are discussed quite thoroughly, you typically don't see most of it. You're shown enough to get the point across.While &#34;Big Bad Wolves&#34; will likely be slandered by some for its grotesque nature, there's much more to the thriller than that since you feel like you're right along with these police officers trying to unravel the mystery and enjoying the carefree demeanor of most of these characters even when their career is on the line or when possibly facing unbearable torture. &#34;Big Bad Wolves&#34; may not be &#34;the best film of the year&#34; like certain directors are claiming, but it is a well-executed thriller that leads its audience down unsuspected winding dirt roads filled with painful uncertainty and a foreseeable yet inevitable amount of suffering.",1391040000,2014-01-30

5.0,"I've loved this show from the first episode of the first season. It takes true genius to make a viewer root for a villain. Of course, now Walt has totally lost sight of his original goal, and I don't think anyone is on his side! After all of the dirty deeds he's committed, he can't simply go back to living a normal life. This first episode of Season 6 proves that.He tries to quietly leave the fast-paced, unpredictable drug dealing life he's created, but now his brother-in-law Hank has learned of his true involvement. To say Hank is pissed would be an understatement. He punches Walt in the jaw and basically gets buck wild on him. At first, Walt tries to deny the accusation that he's really Heisenberg, but when Hank keeps pushing, Walt tells him he'd better tread lightly!Also, Walt's partner in crime, Jesse is having a melt-down. He wants nothing more to do with the millions of dollars in cash he has laying around in duffle bags. He refers to it as drug money (hence the name of this episode - Blood Money). So, he roams the streets in his car tossing out bundles of cash to people in disadvantaged neighborhoods. His progression from small-time hood to big-time gangster back to contrite criminal is an amazingly wild ride. I almost feel sorry for him. Almost.I'd always believed that Walt would end up going to prison and possibly dying there trying to run his business from behind bars. But now that his Cancer is back and he's left the drug game, there could be a different ending. I'm excited to see how this last season will progress. The acting is superb and the plot is always fresh. In my opinion, this is the second-best show on TV, right behind The Walking Dead. AMC has some talented writers. I've been watching Breaking Bad, TWD, Hell on Wheels, and now I just started watching Low Winter Sun - which follows Breaking Bad. I hope it's just as good. If you haven't seen this series, give it a chance. It's a hell of a show.",1376265600,2013-08-12

Do to the writers doing this they lost the other actors in the mix. Tony and McGee felt off so much this season, almost like walking on egg shells around the new character to not hurt her feelings.

4.0,"Guillermo Del Toro, the director of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Hellboy"", seems determined to revive the ghost story. Quite frankly, we need it. Too many `horror' films are excuses for filmmakers to throw buckets of blood and gore at the screen, hurling everything at us in an attempt to see what sticks, or more appropriately, what makes us sick. Gone are the suspense and terror filmmakers like Hitchcock (""Psycho""), Robert Wise (""The Haunting"") and John Carpenter (the original ""Halloween"") who created films with such skill, riveting us to our seats and scaring us away from showers, dark houses and babysitters. Now, `horror' films seem determined to use as many special effects as possible to recreate the goriest, most vial displays. How is this suspenseful or frightening? It is merely sickening.So, it was especially nice to see ""The Orphanage"", a truly creepy, scary ghost story produced by Del Toro and directed by JA Bayona.A brief prologue introduces us to the Orphanage, situated near the ocean. The headmistress takes a phone call and it becomes apparent Laura, who is outside playing with the other five children in the home, will soon be leaving her friends for the comfort of a new family. Many years later, Laura (Belen Rueda), returns to the orphanage with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son, Simon (Roger Princep). Laura and her husband have purchased the building and are renovating it to care for five or six children ""with special needs"". As the renovations continue, Simon makes a new invisible friend and begins talking with him. This is really nothing new for Laura and Carlos, Simon has other invisible friends, so they aren't really concerned. But when Laura takes Simon down to the beach, and they explore the caves, Laura begins to suspect something is different. During the party, to celebrate the opening of their house, Laura has a run in with a strange child wearing a scarecrow mask and Simon disappears. Laura and Carlos search desperately for Simon, following every lead and looking everywhere. They meet a man who agrees to help and brings in a medium, Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin, Charlie's daughter). Infrared equipment is set up everywhere and they watch Aurora's every move as she tries to communicate with the spirits, the presence she feels. After a particularly harrowing moment, she comes back to the present and tells them they have many spirits roaming the house. Six to be precise. As Laura becomes more and more determined to find Simon, she also begins to unravel the secrets behind the other visitors in the house.""The Orphanage"" isn't so much about horror, or shock value, as it is about setting the mood for events that will transpire, creating suspense. From the moment Laura, Carlos and Simon return to the orphanage, to set up their home, we know they have made a bad decision. Why would Laura want to return to the orphanage where she grew up, to set up her new home? This seems strange at first. Was she drawn back to this place? Is there some tie with it, making her return? Then, we learn of Laura and Carlos' plan to reopen the home and care for children with development problems and disabilities. Laura wants to give back some of the help and kindness she received as a child, leading her to take on this huge task.As Laura and Carlos go about setting up this house, they try to provide a normal family life for Simon. But Simon has special needs of his own, and they try to deal with, and address these needs. They try to go about their normal activities, but every time they hear a crash, Laura stops and shudders, not from fright, but because some worker somewhere has probably cost her some more money or delay the project. This is a great way for the filmmakers to divert attention, to give us some false chills, and make the real scares even better.As they get settled in, and begin to explore the grounds. Laura tells Simon about the lighthouse just a bit away, and how she and the other children used to find comfort in it's light. She and Simon spend a lot of time together and begin to explore the grounds. One day, as they enter a cave on the beach, Simon tells his mother of his new friend. Laura has clearly heard of other invisible friends in Simon's life and seems to give it little regard, until he runs off and she sees two sets of footprints.When they are ready to open the house to the other children, they throw a party to welcome everyone. But Simon disappears and Laura has a run-in with a child wearing an old smock, like she wore at the orphanage when she was a child. More bothersome, the child is also wearing a burlap mask with a big smile painted on. Who is this child?When they realize Simon is gone, Laura and Carlos put everything else on hold to search for their son.As all of this is going on, I was amazed at how well Bayona maintains the feel of impending horror. The key to this success lies in how realistic everything appears. Laura's impending dread is almost palpable and Rueda does a great job of making her seem real. As the film progresses, the relationship between Laura and Carlos takes some natural turns and develops in a real way.But everything kicks into high gear when the medium, Aurora, played by Geraldine Chaplin, appears. Carlos is reluctant to go along with this, but because he loves his wife, he follows her lead. And Laura is willing to try anything and everything to find their son. Aurora's associates set-up elaborate recording equipment throughout the house. Then, they put her in the old children's bedroom and watch as she tries to communicate with the spirit or spirits in the house. She almost immediately makes contact and begins to walk through the house, trying to find out more about them, about what they need. As Aurora talks to these spirits, we follow her progress as Laura does, watching everything through monitors, the images captured in grainy green infrared monitors. As we follow her progress, we believe she is actually communicating with these spirits and hope she will be able to make some sort of breakthrough.Chaplin does a great job of making this character believable, scary, yet natural. Aurora believes she can communicate with the dead. Because she believes, there is no reason for her to protest when other people doubt. She knows the truth.More importantly, this sequence is all the more effective because we are watching along with Carlos and Laura, as Aurora progresses through the rooms. We don't see ghosts, or spirits materialize out of thin air, we only hear Aurora trying to communicate with them. We only hear what she says, and it is cryptic at best, but it is very effective at making the scene creepy and spine tingling.Then, Laura continues to search and when the truth is finally revealed, we feel everything she feels.I guess, long story - short (I know, too late), what I am trying to say is Guillermo Del Toro is quietly trying to revive the ghost story, the horror film, and wants us to feel the genuine scares and chills behind the characters and the stories. He is making some scary films, and he is earning our fright with intelligent, well-made efforts that just might prove more influential than the current crop of torture porn.""The Orphanage"" is very successful at creating a mood of impending horror, terror and dread, using none of the techniques we have become accustomed to in horror films. Thank goodness.",1202947200,2008-02-14

He always threatens to kill a member of the family, when in reality he would know that if he killed one of them, he would be dead and he would have no chance of getting what he needed.  So every time he says he is going to kill them, I just roll my eyes.  The wife and kids have had chances to escape.  The kids actually did.  But they ran back home.  It was so stupid.  I mean, the wife was in the, I think C.I.A. place and she could have just told what was happening.  The  other guy, who has them was there, but if he would have been held, he would not have been able to contact the people holding the family.  Plus, all the stuff if for that man.

4.0,"I caught this film on HDNET as part of a sneak peak before it hit theaters. 'Vanishing on 7th Street' could have been a monumental horror film because it delivers so much in terms of atmosphere and genuine fear that is missing from so many horror films these days. The story starts out with a strange occurrence that draws you in and keeps you intrigued for the entire film. The clever use of shadows is creepy and effective and a nice change of pace from the usual gore and blood that is a poor substitute for true horror. It reminded me of the film 'Ghost'(yes, the romantic film with Swayze and Moore)when the ghosts come for those being damned and brought to Hell.The acting is way above average and the characters react like real people and do things one would think they would do in a situation like this. This film works really well on the big screen because you can feel the scope of the shear mass of this evil darkness that is taking over these survivor's world. Also, there are many instances where the shadows are alive, but it is done subtly and may be missed on a TV screen.My biggest problem with the film could also be the film's best attribute, the ending is left open to one's own interpretation, which will put some viewers off who want closure. For me, I would rather have this type of ending over one that gives too much explanation.......sometimes no explanation is better than a dumb one. ;-b",1300579200,2011-03-20

2.0,"""The Innkeepers"" is a thinking person's ghost story. That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West (""The House of the Devil"") attempts to be. He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, the premise of ""The Innkeepers,"" good as it is, ends up being poorly executed. In short, the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary, but all in all tedious.""The Innkeepers"" centers on two hotel clerks Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon. The hotel, it is rumored, is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who died a tragic death many years ago. Claire and Luke, both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities, Claire and Luke, start investigating the legendary ghost, equipped with ghost hunting gear.Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so, keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms. That is not a bad idea. Then, while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax, he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination. The problem is, most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting.""The Innkeepers"" takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn's back stories. Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do, while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator. Besides that, not much is revealed about them. With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) as a guest, who gives a warning to Claire, the story finally knows where it should go.Even then, without a compelling storyline and teasing details, the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good. Until then ""The Innkeepers"" is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end, but the characters' motives remain unclear and unconvincing, and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing. Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension, to be sure, but taking too much time to do so (and saying too little for that matter) is a different thing.",1348444800,2012-09-24
5.0,"Out of all the attempts at a believable show with fantasy species' I think this is one of, if not the best. The special effects are good, there's not a lot of detectable superfluous CGI and there's an ongoing, engaging story line. It's both campy and fun. I also like that there is a same - sex relationship and it doesn't have that persecuted, preachy, 'look at us' undertone.

The writing is superb,the characters are fully developed over the seasons, and the series constantly challenges me. I experienced &#34;binge viewing&#34; for the first time.

4.0,"I never saw this promoted on TV and I wish it had been more popular so there were additional seasons. It's unique and funny. It is an unusual, almost unbelievable storyline but it unfolds in such a way that - if you stay with it - you become hooked. At least I did. I want to know more about why this cop ended up in prison, what's with him and his lawyer, his partner, his exwife and just about everyone else he knew and meets up with. Damien Lewis' character is definitely a contradiction. One of the things I don't like is the repetitive interviews with people about what they think of the cop going to jail. It's seldom new, they keep playing the same stuff over and over. That is a bit annoying. But the series and the actors are great. Adam Arkin has a quirky part, very similar to the character he played on Northern Exposure and equally effective.",1375574400,2013-08-04
4.0,"This show was fun.  It was an exciting combination of your standard musical episode of a run-of-the-mill sitcom with some of the added wit one may find in the Daily Show.  My concern lies in where the writers will take the show.  By utilizing up-to-the minute social, entertainment, and political references this show has the potential to be very entertaining while also challenging the viewer to keep up with trending.  However, if there isn't an ""edge"" applied to the daily grind of the cast members, I don't see this show standing on its own.

3.0,"In Short: Drama revolving around the love between Milo, a gladiator played by Kit Harington, and Cassia, played by Emily Browning, the daughter of a ruler. Class and circumstance keeps them apart but the violent eruption at Pompeii will bring them together.The scenery and effects were both beautiful. I loved the landscapes and the sets full of pillars, columns and statues. Costume designers did an excellent job as well. The eruption was awesome. The entire production really came through visually.Plot and portrayal wise, this one was terribly weak. The love story was built up to be epic but fell short. I didn't feel a tug at my heart or the heat of passion. The only time I got caught up in the film was when Milo thought to extract revenge for the murder of his parents.So I give it 3 stars, largely due to the visual effects, great set and amazing location. A more convincing performance would definitely improve the movie.",1400803200,2014-05-23

4.0,"I just finished watching ""Dead Hooker in a Trunk"" by and starring the Soska twins.  Jen and Sylvia play the leads in one seriously messed up grindhouse-y indie horror film (their first).  Originally planned to star four female leads, someone apparently dropped out and one of the characters was re-written days before shooting began to be a male.So while this would have been a different film if it starred and entirely female cast, I have to say the inclusion of C.J. Wallis as ""Goody Two Shoes"" was a stroke of luck.  Although he was busy co-starring in the film, as noted on IMDB he also ""...edited, shot, sound tracked, marketed, and did all post on the film.""  He is absolutely hilarious in this film and show a key sense of comedic timing.As for the Soska twins...what can I say.  Smart, sexy, dark and a little disturbing...well a lot disturbing.  At one point, I realized that they might be just playing themselves (seemed so natural as loopy twins).So how was the movie?  For an indie first time horror film I have to say hats off to these ladies.  They really took on an ambitious amount of locations, story, and action for a first film.  I wasn't sure what the film would look like or feel like, but having seen it would argue it's very much a ""grindhouse"" film as much as ""horror.""Is there blood?  Guts?  Violence?  Absolutely.  The twins handle ever increasing horror, violence, confusion and surreal accidents with passion and strength.  While one sister (""Geek"" played by Jen) is a bit of a wallflower, it's soon apparent that she's not just a brainy beauty but able to step into the shadows.  Her sister (""Badass"" played by Sylvia) is a loose cannon dealing rage, violence and death blows without hesitation.  These two excite, frighten and subdue all who come in their way.The plot is a bit light and confusing at times (essentially a serial killer stalking hookers and following the twins after said hooker ends up in the trunk of Badass's car), but overall it keeps moving at a frenetic pace and you don't often linger on any scene.I guess I am a twisted, dark soul (see my book ""Dark Bites"") so much of the blood, violence and guts was very familiar to me and often made me laugh out loud.  There were some genuine, ""I didn't see it coming"" moments that made me jump (batter up).Is it perfect?  No, but it's a really great, ambitious first step to the dark side.  They wrote something and made it happen-that alone should be demand our support (in particular from those of us in the horror community).  But you'll also enjoy some great music (a trifle loud over the dialogue at times), kick ass gals put in insane situations and a lot of gory/violence.  I suspect and anticipate that with success, more time/budget/equipment they'll have ever increasing success making horror films we can all fall in love with.I recommend you rent this movie and leave a review here and follow these ladies as I do on Twitter (@twisted_twins).  Stay bloody!",1316995200,2011-09-26

4.0,"About Cherry is a pretty sad movie, I think. Not sad in the usual way, though. It's about a girl played by Ashley Hinshaw that enters the porn business because she's looking for a successful career choice as well as a way to make some quick and easy cash. Working in porn -depending on the photo or movie shoot- can reward the actress anywhere from $500-1,000. To a young aspiring young actress, that's a LOT of money. She can't resist.  We see the part that I was most curious about- when she first walks into a porn studio and fills out the job application.  I've always had a curiosity what kind of questions they ask the girl... and as I'd feared, they're pretty blunt and direct sexual-related questions. Still, it's not enough to discourage Ashley to just walk away.  She continues on.Unfortunately the actress in this movie doesn't realize that what she's doing is widely considered inappropriate to everyone in her life. Her friends, mom, boyfriend... they all want to drill the message into her head that what she's doing is disgusting and wrong, and that when surrounded by people who care deeply about her, she shouldn't be doing it. These people appreciate Ashley for who she is but... she apparently doesn't realize it. She's so determined to become a legitimate actress plus getting a generous paycheck for participating in the sexual acts, that she doesn't seem to care what anyone else thinks. She's unaware that the people who care about her don't agree with her career decisions. The boyfriend screaming ""It's DISGUSTING!"" during one particular scene is a highlight. He says it over and over again to the young girl so intensely, that she tears up and basically freezes, unsure how to respond. There's also a pretty good amount of time devoted to Ashley and a man she meets at a part time strip club job.The good news is that Ashley definitely has a lot of emotion and cares deeply for others so if you think she spends her time in About Cherry totally clueless and being treated solely as a sex object, guess again.  However when it comes to her career, she seems to turn a blind eye to reality and progresses forward.  Maybe that's what real porn actors and actresses do when it's time to film a photo shoot, and how they've managed to make a name for themselves.  They just *do* it without feeling anything that might prevent them from going through with it.The movie sort of changes as it rolls along and focuses on one of the women that works with Ashley's character (played by Heather Graham). She's an older woman that happens to have a girlfriend of her own, and the storyline -for whatever reason- shifts to focusing on Heather and the relationship troubles she experiences with her girlfriend. I find this somewhat odd since the movie worked so hard with Ashley Hinshaw's character. Also the ending... it's bad. It basically goes against what I thought was going to happen for one thing, but even worse, it never touches upon a conclusive element pertaining to the people in Ashley's life (her mom, friends and boyfriend). We needed to know MORE. Without spoiling the ending, the scene before the credits roll just... seems completely not right.  It feels incomplete.While I agree with the other reviews that it seems odd how Ashley never even tried to search for another more respectable job, you have to remember when you're young and just graduated high school, you fall victim to how overwhelmingly confusing the world can be at that young age, so an opportunity to make easy money in a porn business doesn't seem so outrageous or far-fetched given the circumstances.  Your perception at that age is focused more on succeeding in any way possible so you can feel secure and independent, and have the power to take care of yourself.",1367798400,2013-05-06

And his kids think he has cancer. He doesn't. He just can't admit he swings for the other team. You might start to feel bad for him. So the writing is good.You have a brother who says he wants to flip his Dad's house. He gets mad because his Dad is going to give it to the oldest sister. He claims he is going to a ""show"" which really meant he was meeting a hooker. He apparently can't finish the job with his wife (I'm assuming that's who the blond is.) He wants her to cover a song. He tells her he loves her. Blah blah. I'm bored. Not feeling. The writers lost my interest. The guy is obsessed with women, drugs, and music.The youngest daughter is manly. The father says out of all his kids, she is the only one who understands. They talk about having a depressed gene. The youngest daughter hates her body and she becomes attracted to a trainer she saw at the park. He complaints her tightness. Blah blah. She does a lot of push-ups to try to look attractive.Now the oldest sister is bisexual? She is married to some man, but she runs into her lesbian lover from a trip and then they make love at the end of the episode. Well, they just make out. Then her father walks in (he is dressed like a woman) and says ""hey ladies."" Then the episode ends. Like we didn't see that coming. No shock factor and it didn't leave me asking for another episode.

That is to be expected and it wasn't an issue. After all, it is rated Mature. But it was like the writers had an okay idea and just couldn't figure out the direction the show needed to go.

People will forget there is a hole in the plot because they will be distracted by the naked women.I can't see this becoming a series and it isn't something that would want me to keep my Prime.

Watching this episode, I have to say UGH. So immature and wish she would just stop talking, stop making faces, just grow up. Seriously, to replace extremely classy Cote w/this character is like bringing a barn animal to dinner at the palace. NCIS has always had mature, elegant actors. Why ruin it now? Unless they want the show to fail... maybe the writers are tired and want to end with season 11. Just thinking now of Prentis, who was with Criminal Minds. Now that would have been a very cool choice for a replacement. Sadly, I won't be looking forward to the next episodes as I used to, and may not even watch anymore. Too bad because NCIS used to be one of the very few great shows left.",1380412800,2013-09-29
5.0,"I love this show.  Even when the seasons lead to a place that you think they can't go on and the next season starts off weird and you just don't know if you should still watch, they pull it out and hook me in some more.  I know that was a long sentence, but I couldn't help it!  We wait for this show every week!  My husband and I agree so seldom on a show, but this one has great elements for male and female fans alike.  Plus, Matt Bomber is sooo easy on the eyes and such a charmer.  I love watching his genius come alive on the screen!If you're not watching, catch up on episodes now!",1390867200,2014-01-28
4.0,"Although it was short lived on the series lineups, it had a good cast and script of action, suspense, and science-fiction to keep all those who attempt to make science work in science fiction, busy watching. Aliens and populated Earth bound ascentient beings existing over time has many philosophical brain teasers questioning whether we are alone or if your neighbor, loved-one, or friend are bit more than you think.  It's a great re-watch of Science Fiction made into a series that does not or should not bend your mind too much. Enjoy.",1400457600,2014-05-19
5.0,"Superb and outstanding are the words I think of when trying to explain this pilot. The title seems to give the storyline away, but for all the members of this family, it explains it all.Jeffrey Tambor, is the patriarch of this family, two daughters and a son with issues of their own, and are they issues. As the  father says, his children only think of themselves. The younger daughter unhappy with her body, no job, no real life. Middle son, seems to have sex with every woman who moves, but has he found love at last. The older daughter, married with children, but meets her college lesbian lover at their children's school. Dad and mom divorced, and it seems mom, played by Judith Light, talks incessantly. She has another husband in the throes of dementia, or maybe just never has a chance to talk. The children, all adults trying to find their way. And, the biggest elephant in the room belongs to dad. He can't seem to talk about his issue except to his group.The writing and acting are superb. Grabbed me from the first scene. I can only hope this becomes a series. Opening new doors, and closing other ones. Hello, girls, really!Recommended. prisrob 02-09-14",1391904000,2014-02-09
5.0,"The knowledge that we get to see Zooey Deschanel at least twenty-some more times in prime time (Fox recently ordered a full season of New Girl) was the best news of the year until Sarah Palin announced she would not be running for president in 2012. Maybe Zooey could take her place and subvert the Republican Party with her hipster aura? Headlining a show on Fox, she's already halfway there. New Girl is an absolute delight. Much like the American Idol judges tell great singers they ""could sing the phone book"" and still be entertaining, Zooey Deschanel proves with New Girl that all she has to do is ramble nonsensically onscreen with those cute anime eyes and be utterly captivating.The instant success of New Girl comes as no surprise; the show has many levels of appeal. First, it is infinitely quotable. Good luck escaping, ""Pink wine makes me slutty,"" at the water cooler. Second, it follows the tradition of strange living arrangement sitcoms (see: The Big Bang Theory, and just about every other sitcom). Third, it is quirky and offbeat, which gives elitists something to latch onto, while remaining relatable and mainstream (its sense of humor is reminiscent of Apatow comedies). Fourth, it lacks a laugh track, which automatically earns it the label of ""smart comedy"" by many critics. Fifth, Zooey Deschanel. Zooey, Zooey, Zooey. Just put a pair of glasses on her, give her a dorky character to play, and it has the Tina Fey Effect. We look past her supermodel good looks and somehow believe she's a nerdy girl like us.The surprise appeal has another name: Max Greenfield. You might remember him as Calvin's hot teacher boyfriend on Greek, and his dreaminess hasn't faded in his new role. As one of the three dudes that Deschanel's character, Jess, moves in with, Greenfield's Schmidt is known for saying things that require putting dollars into a ""douche bag jar."" Together, the three-guys-one-girl ensemble is an instantly familiar gang of friends we wish we had. The pleasure of New Girl is derived from the feeling that you're in on a series of very well crafted inside jokes. And in terms of writing, well crafted jokes they are. This new girl is here to stay.For more reviews check out enter-detainment on blogspot!",1319414400,2011-10-24

4.0,"I went into this expecting a supernatural horror because of the description and marketing; I originally thought this movie was a haunted apartment, Silent Hill 4: The Room style film. Occupant is a psychological thriller about a young man, Danny, that has to stay in his dead grandmother's apartment for 12 days in order to keep it at a low monthly price. If he leaves, he risks the possibility of the landlord kicking him out. Consequently, Danny begins to suffer from paranoia leading to delusions and hallucinations. The story was great until the end that tries to explain everything. I personally thought it was weak since it still left many unanswered questions. The day by day transitions were overdone and some of the editing was bad. It's creepy but not scary. The acting was fine.There is some blood, and a brief sex scene (nothing is shown). I recommend going into this film as a psychological thriller, not a ghost-horror movie. It'll be much better that way. It's available on Netflix Streaming as of 6/23/12, if you're slightly interested.",1340409600,2012-06-23
1.0,"I really really wanted to like this pilot.  I love all things apocalyptic so I was super excited to see this in my list.  However, I only made it through maybe 20 minutes before I turned it off.  I don't know if the script sucked or the actors sucked but the line delivery was bad, the lines themselves were bad and I had zero investment in any of the characters.  There's the French actress with the perfect husband/child and flawless morals who also happens to be beautiful.  The rich old white lady who whines a bit much for my taste.  The expensive call girl who takes offense at being called a hooker.  The handsome attorney.  The incompetent Latina cop and of course, the black prison escapee who is brave beyond comparison, smart beyond belief and keeps his word when all others wouldn't have.....I waded through 20 minutes of bad character development and even worse plot development before I changed the channel.

The story line in this series is painfully slow and lacks the intrigue of most new shows of similar genre.

It's a cliche show with little to no creativity.I'll usually make it through a full episode or two with little to no distraction, but found myself doing other things around the house while it was playing in the background.

5.0,"Aside from the intrigue of the story line, I have always been a fan of Titus Welliver, Alan Rosenberg, Amy Aquino, and Scott Wilson.  I like how Harry Bosh's character is not derailed by his own life, that of a serious trial going on against him, but yet, he quietly keeps doing his job.  Harry Bosh has that perfect mix of charm, brooding, take charge, and he is a gentler force.  I am glad they did not go the way many of these cops shows do, where police brutality becomes the norm.  I do not find that very entertaining.  Although, I like that Harry Bosh does not take s*** and stands his ground, I also like the fact that he has a difficult past that rears it's ugly head when he is working (child abuse).  However, I am glad that his past is interjected without showing too much of the abuse itself.  Titus Welliver is always good as is Amy Aquino.  But I have always loved Alan Rosenberg!  He is smart, clever, entertaining (can be very funny) and believable as the physician.  Rosenberg has been doing this acting thing a long time and he knows what he is doing.  I certainly hope in continues to be in every episode and not in some small way, much like Amy Aquino.  I see these two actors as stand out actors that can really add a texture to this show, but we need to see them more than just as cameo appearances.  Great show!  I guess this means we will not be seeing Titus Welliver on the Good Wife in the future.  He was great on that show.  You loved to hate him!  Great show - a real keeper!!",1392681600,2014-02-18

3.0,"First of all very well produced. And the lead is wonderful and natural. But I still feel as if I've been there done this before. Wish I could see a show with older characters, more depth and more minorities in stronger roles.Are all people on Earth into drugs, casual sex , and fragile egos? Maybe that's what the writers and creators know and are familiar with. The first key to writing is write what you know. So with that in mind, I am sure there is an ongoing audience for this material.But it does not seem as original as &#34;Orange is the New Black&#34; or &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; But it is by far wayyyyyyyy better than Amazon's &#34;Alpha House.&#34;I am not a huge fan of classical music but I do enjoy it. So I enjoyed the show for that reason alone.I think the Amazon team might be better served producing dramedies with an hour long format that will give it time to develop story, plot and characters a bit more. And perhaps introduce some truly new voices to the process. Sure it's nice to have &#34;big names&#34; on board to promote a new venture.

Without giving too much away, the characters have been throw into a new setting and most of the season shows them trying to cope with the changes.  The humor remains similar to previous seasons.  The episodes do follow a much more linear storyline, vs the stand-alone episodes of the past that were only loosely connected to each other.

3.0,"This one is a little difficult to watch; while there are a few interesting moments there seem to be an abundance of meaningless filler moments that are difficult to watch. At midpoint I had to stop it and recover before I could go on with the movie the next day. You may well ask why I bothered and the only answer I can provide to that question was a slight curiosity how it would end.A little over half way through the movie starts getting a little more interesting as the two leads start their return to the USA. A serious libido problem on the guy's part causes them to miss a vital connection on their return trip and choose an alternate route home through dangerous territory.Much of the story is told after dark so the demands on the cgi are correspondingly reduced. In its favor there are some effective scenes showing life in the Mexican villages and some of the sequences are marginally interesting.Now let's consider another possibility; what if the alien monsters were symbolic of drug cartels, what if the whole thing is an allegory for the current situation with drug cartels in Northern Mexico? If one thinks in those terms there are some interesting parallels; for example the efforts of the United States to protect itself with a wall. Another would be the infected zones and their parallel with areas controlled by the cartels. The alien monsters had long tentacles which is similar to the tentacles of influence exercised by the cartels. The monsters were most active after dark which also characterizes the cartels. In those areas attacked by the monsters there was much devastation which is also a goal of the cartels. Another parallel are the evacuated zones in the United States; there are already areas of Arizona where citizens are warned not to go, are these infected zones perhaps?I've not seen any suggestions that the allegorical nature of Monsters is intended to reflect Northern Mexico's drug problem but it does make for some interesting speculation.If you are a dedicated sci-fi fan you may want to watch it just so you can say you did or you may want to check me out on my allegory speculation. I would be interested in hearing from any of you who care to investigate the possibility.",1340236800,2012-06-21

3.0,"I was interested in this show because of the material presented in the book ""Blink"", in which microexpressions are used very successfully. However, one should be careful about trying to apply what you see in this show. For example, the episode where a character is focused on because he is unconsciously or subconsciously giving someone the ""finger,"" can lead to all kinds of amateur misapplication, especially for people who do not use that gesture. It's pop science, emphasis on the pop, so just take it with a grain of salt.Also, photos of many celebrities and especially politicians are shown with a certain gesture or expression and described authoratitively as meaning or feeling this or that. This seems to speak more to the writers' prejudices and biases rather than actual facts. So, again, a word of caution. Reading microexpressions is a science which requires years of training and study; do not go off on your friends and coworkers for supposedly lying to you based on what you've seen here.So, all good fun, if you're not overly gullible.",1251158400,2009-08-25

No fear, as long as they are not outnumbered, even leaving one stray walker alone. The focus of the show has shifted from fighting the dead, though that is still a big emphasis. Now, it seems that learning to live among the living in peace has become the order of the day. And it's not going real well. I've said it often... this is not my normal genre of show. But something in the first episode captured me and has held me rapt for every show since then... it's not a show about dead people, it's a show about relationships among the living in a world gone mad. If everyone is infected, the situation will probably never change for these folks.That provokes a sort of desperation in their living and clinging to each other. I could go on and on about this show. I don't watch any other show with this type of theme. Nothing compares.",1354665600,2012-12-05

5.0,"It is not hard to swallow that Kubrick sprinkled his masterpiece The Shining, with hidden messages and subversive themes. The man had a 200 IQ for goodness sake. I think this movie does a good job of laying out many of the possible interpretations of Kubrick's work. I won't give spoilers, but some of the possible themes are more believable than others. I especially liked the one having to do with Danny's sweater. This is a must see for Kubrick and The Shining fans.",1365724800,2013-04-12

4.0,"It has to be acknowledged that in a series like this creating a second season that is as good as the first one is a tall order. The reason for me saying this is that in the first season, the writers had the advantage of being able to surprise us over and over. The simple explanation of the micro-expressions and how they helped to detect lying was fascinating. That is a tool they do not have anymore. Therefore, this led them to compensate by incorporating some over the top stories and introduce much more action in the episodes.In the first half of the season there were several episodes that had to do with terrorism, and these were the ones that I enjoyed the least. There were of course elements of the plot that had to do with what the Lightman group does, but there was a lot of action and suspense as the main ingredients. I typically enjoy series that use these, but in ""Lie to me"" I am looking for something different. I was glad to see that in the second half they found a way to balance the normal activities of the group with a little less action.There were several episodes that had to do with personal situations related to the main characters, and I enjoyed this very much. Be it Lightman's daughter, Foster's love interest or Torres' sister, these are fun to watch when you have spent time getting to know the characters. As usual, Tim Roth's performance is top notch and he robs the accolades in this regard.When I finished watching this season I was sad to realize that I only have a few more episodes left in season 3 and that the show would be over after that, which tells me that I am still enjoying this series quite a bit.",1378252800,2013-09-04
3.0,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:Al Capone and the Chicago Mob.  Lucky Luciano and the 5-Families in NYC.  Media has done a great job of illustrating organized crime in 2 of the 3 major US cities.  From Boardwalk Empire to Billy Bathgate, NYC and Chicago have been covered.  Much less is known about the early days of organized crime in LA.  While there was big budget production about Bugsy Siegel, it mainly covered his relationship with Virginia Hill and the construction of The Flamingo in Las Vegas.So kudos to TNT for taking on this project.  However, sometimes a good idea, simply does not result in good execution.  I wracked my brain to come up with the correct descriptor for why the production value didn't work for me.  Overly dramatic, not gritty, too staged?1.) Sid Rothman (Robert Knepper) is a fictional character.  Were there so few bad guys in LA in the 40's & 50's that for production value, one had to be made up?2.) While I generally like Edward Burns, I couldn't see him as a Jewish gangster.  Also, Siegel had what amounted to a 6th grade education and while he might have been suave, I can't imagine that he had much of a vocabulary3.) Ned Stax (Milo Ventimiglia) is another made up character and I have not generally liked Milo Ventimiglia in any of his prior roles4.) The violent scenes all came off as too stagedNoticeably absent from my commentary is John Bernthal as Detective Joe Teague.  Mr. Bernthal might have been more engaging were the show's title ""Mob City Zombies""Metacritics gave Mob City a Metascore of 63 (based on 32-reviews), which is probably about right to a tad generous.  With a number of TV series concluding their mid-season run, there are worse options.",1386892800,2013-12-13

4.0,"""Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files"" is a series originally aired at ScyFy. It follows a team of people investigating real or perceived paranormal phenomena, from UFOs and ghosts to mermaids and (surprise) the Honey Island Swamp Monster. The team attempts to re-enact various ""paranormal"" scenarios to see if they really lack a mundane explanation. The whole thing reminds me of ""Finding Bigfoot"", but with a broader scope. And yes, the women on this show more skin than the BRFO's tomboy Ranae...Somewhat surprisingly, ""Fact or Faked"" takes a mostly sceptical angle on the problems under investigation. My favourite is the debunking of the bizarre urban legend about ghost children in Texas pushing cars up a slope. The team finds out that even school buses (!) are being ""pushed"" up the slope at the place in question...but unfortunately the whole thing is an optical illusion. It's really a downslope!Another classic is the debunking of ""Dr. Jonathan Reed"", who claims that his Golden Retriever was killed by a crazy alien in the Cascade Mountains. The alien had an obelisk-shaped craft. Reed killed the intruder, took the body to his cabin but lost all evidence during a burglary. Conclusion? About as fake as you can possibly get! I admit that I didn't like the debunking of the poor old Honey Island Swamp Monster, though. I mean, I happen to believe in such stuff. But perhaps there is hope after all, since ""Fact or Faked"" haven't been able to explain the mysterious Nightcrawler of Fresno. But sure, I suppose it could be a hungry shorebird looking for the closest fast food place!Despite the mostly sceptical angle, not everyone is pleased with the paranormal files. Both the CSI and the James Randi Educational Foundation have published a highly critical review of the series. It seems ""Fact or Faked"" don't rule out *all* paranormal phenomena, and occasionally makes a few gaffes. Orb spider, anyone? So while true believers might think an Illuminati plot is behind this one, the sceptical community see it as yet another paranormal ""fifth column"". Pseudo-sceptics fighting pseudo-sceptics? Will the real sceptic please stand up, LOL! As C.S. Lewis would say: ""Really, we are hard to please""...Personally, I think ""Fact or Faked"" is somewhat uneven, with some episodes being pretty boring, while others are more interesting, even intriguing. However, since I want to annoy the CSI this week, I'm willing to oversee the Honey Island debunking and give this series...four stars. How about that?",1366329600,2013-04-19

4.0,"This show got off to a rocky start, but many shows do. As the season has gone on, and the show lost viewers, the writing and cast chemistry has only improved. In our culture of instant gratification, we (and network executives) have forgotten than the greatest and most enduring shows don't really get good until the second or third season. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has the potential to be one of those shows. Here's hoping that this show endures like Star Trek: The Next Generation and doesn't get kicked to the curb like Firefly.",1390262400,2014-01-21
5.0,"A cross between a Western and a Police Detective story, it has a unique style that doesn't feel copied.  The characterizations are different than typical police shows, and I found myself growing fonder of the actors with each episode. I haven't read the books, but the TV pilot has me wanting to do just that. My complements to all those involved in creating the pilot, it was excellent and has me wanting more.  The cast is super, with many recognizable faces including Lou Diamond Phillips. Personally I think he is underrated and deserves larger parts, but I'm glad to see him in Longmire. The pilot is like a movie and if nothing else I recommend you buy the pilot like I did.  The cost is low and the production values are high.  The writing, directing, acting, and camera work is first rate.  I plan to buy the whole series. If you like this checkoutTom Selleck: Stone Cold.CA Luster",1345680000,2012-08-23

It lives up to the descriptions of my friend, but I was disturbed by how the therapists treated - or rather failed to treat - the underly issues of the &#34;hoarders.&#34;  The show is seriously over dramatized, which isn't unexpected for a reality TV show, but I would expect more from the therapists, who I would assume have a professional duty to treat their patients rather than to just antagonize for the cameras.",1389139200,2014-01-08

2.0,"I enjoyed The Sopranos so decided to give this a whirl in order to see if fiction and ""reality"" overlap much. It turns out that this is not only comparing apples to oranges; it is also like comparing the Mona Lisa (The Sopranos) to an avant-garde exhibit that consists of a pile of poop (Mob Wives). I am loathe to review an available season without having watched it in its entirety, but I just couldn't get thru many eps of this... there is only so much dim-witted posturing, backstabbing, lying, and general ugliness that I can handle in any given month (when not balanced out by creativity and other redeeming qualities, as in a work of fiction).From a purely anthropological viewpoint, however, this show has some worth. It provides a small bit of insight into what a blue collar criminal lifestyle can lead to: material wealth, broken families, and a mindset of coming at problems shouting and predisposed to violence. Since Mob Wives is not without context, it also offers perspective on a broader (societal) scale. It is, more often than not, a sickening serial to watch, even if you are prone to being entertained by low culture. I estimate that two of the women are of very low intelligence, one is of low intelligence, and one is of low to moderate intelligence. Aside from needing the money, I can't imagine why these 4 would have agreed to do this show (although if I remember correctly, one of them wanted to write a book, so this is obviously good publicity). They either are clueless about how pathetic they appear to the rest of us, or they don't care (laughing all the way to the bank).I skipped ahead to an episode titled ""Dumb or Stupid?"" (the producers probably would have liked this to be the name of the show, rather than just one episode) because I wanted to see how far these women would go against their ""friends"" at a dinner gathering. Unfortunately, a guy on the set intervened before any blood was spilled. Mobsters just aren't what they used to be.",1388102400,2013-12-27
2.0,"Revised April 7, 2012 EPISODES 1-13The action is okay, the animation is pretty good, the effects and sound are good and the music isn't bad but in the end this hero's journey is just too demoralizing.  The story is supposedly about Blade search for vengeance for his mother's death but while Blade has touching farewells with relative strangers, the farewell he had with his mother under similar circumstances was horrible creating an awkward comparison and severely diminishing the resonance of Blade's mission.Blade is depicted as needing to be rescued so often he sometimes becomes a secondary character in the series.  He is stomped emotionally, physically and even literally at crucial moments.  Tough fights?  Great.  Constantly getting beat down when it matters most?  Pass.  Blade has some good points, but the first installments will only be entertaining to those who enjoy watching the hero being crucified and the thirteenth episode will be even more bizarre than it is without them.Hold your holy water and wait for the next story arc.",1332115200,2012-03-19

If you like the other Joss Whedon shows you'll like this one, lots of action, imaginative scripts, and good acting. It's also nice to see the familiar faces from other shows, especially because some of them are playing such different parts...I guess I shouldn't admit it, because it shows how tacky I am, but suddenly I realize they can act, as opposed to those actors that can only do well in one type of role.Some of Joss Whedon's shows took a season to really get going but the script and cast is tight from the pilot with dollhouse, oh and now that I understand the name I like it.

4.0,"For me, the interviews and array of footage in this documentary are what make it so enjoyable.50% of our happiness is determined by our genetic composition, 10% of our happiness is based on our surrounding and 40% is unknown, leaving you to wonder if you can truly determine your own happiness in life. Personally I think yes. At the end of the day it is up to you whether you're going to let any stimuli effect your mood in any way. Everyone is different but one thing is for certain, we need outside stimuli to help process an emotional feed.This film visits many different cultures throughout the movie which really gives you a different perspective of what makes everyone happy or unhappy, regardless of their social or economic background. I would recommend watching this movie in a class or group environment as it fuels great topics of discussion. Two things to keep in mind is that this film is not a &#34;how to be happy&#34; and it does not go into discussion about people who may have disorders that would or could otherwise take control of their responses to stimuli (whether internal or external).",1384214400,2013-11-12

4.0,"My bias...Loves: Gangster moviesLikes: Gratuitous violenceDislikes: Long moviesHates: Homemade dentistryI've been looking forward to Beat Takeshi's 'Outrage' for months. I saw the trailer last fall and was instantly excited, and was even more excited this week when I saw that it popped up on Netflix available for streaming. Needless to say, I watched it the first chance I got.The long and short of this flick - Beat plays a guy who runs a crew that takes care of the Yakuza's dirty work. Obviously, there's some things that can go awry with a profession like this and things get hairy. What evolves is a double crossing, lying, cheating, murderous tale that involves too many players to keep track of. Fingers get lopped off, bullets fly, and blood spills.You'll have to pay attention to get the most out of this movie, but stick with it. It's a brisk movie, at 109 minutes - just to my tastes - but there's a lot going on. The violence is brutal - there were two parts that made me want to look away.This isn't Beat's best, but it's absolutely worth a watch.Score: 4/5 Stars",1331424000,2012-03-11
3.0,"This is a night time soap opera on a grand scale. To sum up the plot; every single character is a big time conniving liar with huge problems like alcohol, drugs etc. and they are out to get money from their family, friends or clients with any means possible, even if they have to kill them for it. Another possible title for this show can be ""The last liar standing"" because every episode seems like a race among the characters; who is going to outsmart and manage to ruin the others.There are plenty of totally absurd unbelievable twists and turns, as in all soap operas, where every possible criminal and indecent behavior is piled up in huge doses; infidelity, murder, fraud, drug abuse, greedy schemes, prostitution, impersonation and plenty more.The hook is typical in TV shows of recent years; everyone is good looking and wealthy, the scenes are opulent and the twists are entertaining, so it makes the viewers feel good about the fact that they are better people than these evil, ruthless and degenerate upper-class characters.The main character that we are supposed to identify with is Bridget, who is relatively better than the others, but she was an irresponsible drug edict and a prostitute and the show presents her as a totally changed woman as soon as she assumed her twin's identity, like a miracle happened to her - absurd, of course.If I critique it as a soap opera then I have to say it's good. But I personally am bothered by the fact that every drama on TV now is a soap opera. It seems like there is nothing to watch now except gritty crime shows and soap operas. The good old shows like ""The Waltons"", ""The Wonder years"" or ""Thirtysomething"" with nice decent people are non-existent, and all the dramas now are full of criminals, drug addicts, mean people and thugs who are getting prime time exposure. And as long as these ""low lifes"" are good looking or wealthy or portrayed as ""simpatico"", the public is willing to accept it all without question.",1356220800,2012-12-23

But the whole warewolf storyline was pretty much vacant and nothing, and I mean NOTHING happens in this movie. The writer/director couldn't create a full and compelling story, the writing is flat, the acting is only really good from Juno Temple, and the direction is sloppy. And the way Riley Keough looks in this movie is like a young Elvis Presley which is I'm sure intentional since that is her grandfather for crying out loud! I just didn't believe the relationship between Jack & Diane, they fall in love way too quickly and I can't figure out why they do?

4.0,"Fellini it ain't, but Burn Notice is a well made entertainment with watchable people and a snarky sense of humor. The story is about a fired American spy, who seems to have some lethal enemies up high, but the episodes are - well - episodic, as he takes on various violent jobs to make a living while trying to find out who did what to him in DC. In a sense, Burn Notice is a story about families - Donovan, his ex-girlfriend (Gabrielle Anwar - very watchable and funny), and his best friend making up one family, the members of whom are always there for each other, though not without the resentments and egos of real family. In addition, Donovan also has a ""real"" family with whom he has issues - an annoying mother (Sharon Gless) and an irresponsible brother (whose character actually seems to develop over time.) The acting ranges from appropriately deadpan (the lead actor, Jeffrey Donovan, who is good here and was even better in the much mourned Touching Evil) to appropriately over-the-top (various villains.) Two objections: 1. The story is set in Miami, but there are no African-Americans. Why not? and 2: Why is Sharon Gless both under-used and confined to one whining note? She's a good actress and could do so much more. Still, all in all, a winner in the light entertainment mode - light years better than so-called reality TV.",1198627200,2007-12-26

5.0,"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generallythe blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problemand I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there wasa slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhapsit was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefullyit seemed more a reproduction problem.This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but acceptas an artistic decision.Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might wantto make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the bestyou can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the laterdiscs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too lateto ask for an exchange.None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode theoccasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wifenever noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as thoughyou can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuatequickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the mathand figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray boxset for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extrasas the US box set.  Well worth considering as long as the price holds up.",1320796800,2011-11-09

4.0,"I never saw the original mini-series or the TV series that followed in the 1980's. I don't even think I was born when it first aired, but I knew the story and looked forward to this updated version with better FX and acting. For some reason they showed the first four episodes last fall, then held off until March 2010 to continue the season. What a way to lose viewers ABC.The whole cast is pretty good, other than the annoying son, whose sole purpose is to get on my nerves. Elizabeth Mitchell from LOST, Morena Baccarin from Firefly (now sporting a short haircut that only she can pull off) and Laura ""Supergirl"" Vandervoort from Smallville lead an attractive cast of women that kick butt and look good doing it. Baccarin as the leader of the lizard aliens, Anna, is by far the standout in my opinion. The combination of the way she looks and talks is a perfect match for the alien charged with making all of use Earthlings follow her every word.As of this moment, we are only 8 episodes in and the characters are getting more fleshed out with each passing week. We are also getting a piece by piece look at what the aliens look like under the fake human skin suits. I read that ABC will probably get rid of Flashforward or V. I watch them both, but V is a much better show that deserves at least another season. I don't have a love for V like I do for the show that comes on right before it, LOST, but it's fun to watch and the writers keep the twists coming.",1271289600,2010-04-15
5.0,"Just finished watching the first episode. I was reluctant to start watching a drama about spies and such; I'm just not much into that kind of drama. I had liked, &#34;Homeland,&#34; when it first came out, but like so many great shows that are instantly popular, it became, cheesy(?) and seemed to be going more for dramatics then actual drama. So, ya, I was skeptical about a similar show. I have to say I was immensely relieved to be so wrong. First, the casting is perfect; you wouldn't think Russell could pull it off, but she does so and does so magnificently. I know I'm wronging her about doubting her acting chops, mainly because I'm ignorant of her work beyond her , &#34;Felicity,&#34; years. But, she is absolutely wonderful in her role. And the chap they have playing her husband, (sorry forgot his name already, bad with those), is perfectly suited to both his role and well as being opposite Russell. Their onscreen chemistry is so much beyond just anything intimate, they really do seem like 2 people who have known each other for 20 plus years, but still get surprised every now and again. I also like that it was set in the 80s, mainly because those were my teen and early 20 years, so getting to see the lifestyle, and, particularly, hearing the music from then, again, is a wonderful treat. It's weird to really appreciate a show more simply because they play ONLY the music from the 80s (which they really didn't have to, but it's still nice they were that thorough.) I can see several seasons ahead for this show (I hope). It's premise is strong, and the potential for various plotlines is certainly there. A major perk for the show, I think, is that it's on a cable channel, and not one of the big &#34;4&#34; on primetime. Yes, they like ratings on cable, but they aren't as driven, it seems, to air shows simply to garner mindless viewers. The show is allowed to be extra sharp, witty, a bit graphic, and certainly more adult (in good ways) then anything you'd find on the primetime channels. If you are tired of singing, dancing, &#34;survival&#34;, watching millionaires play, type of reality shows that seem to infest every channel about number 1, take an hour out of your evening and give this show a chance. Even as I'm writing this review, I have episode 2 from season 1 playing in the background. Thank-you, cable t.v., and Amazon, for bringing a show like this to the small screen. It's sorely needed. And another, special, thanks to Amazon for bringing this show free to Prime members like myself. The shipping savings alone make the membership price (whatever that may be in the future) well worth the cost, but it's wonderful having access to movies and excellent shows like, &#34;The Americans,&#34; as an extra perk.",1393459200,2014-02-27

Harvey Specter and Mike have such an interesting relationship and it has been fascinating to watch the characters grow &#8211; it seems that Harvey has grown as a person whilst mentoring Mike and Mike has grown in respect and loyalty towards Harvey.  They are a fabulous team.I wish the authors could work out how Mike could become legal!One can&#8217;t help but feel for Louis (he is so needy but also brilliant) but I would not like to get on the wrong side of him!  It was so sweet to see him in love &#8211; sad that it did not work out.Rachel is wonderful &#8211; a really important part of the Series.  She is absolutely unique and so likable &#8211; and funny.Jessica still needs to open up a bit; we don&#8217;t really know her but have had a glimpse here and there of a strong and kind woman.Donna is lovely and has really found her niche in the firm.  She is just right for Mike and I appreciate the strength of their relationship.All in all the humor and wit in the dialogue make this a very enjoyable piece of entertainment.,1401148800,2014-05-27

Kit Harington as the lead is very low key in his performance and I think that is what was called for as the free boy, turned slave, turned gladiator. Very good. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the man he meets at the arena and is destined to fight to the death but become buds, he is terrific, too. Outside of out gladiator friends...not much acting to talk about. Emily Browning always looks too doe-eyed and pouting and not buying her at all as the rich girl who loves the slave. Kiefer Sutherland trying some type of accent and strutting, not a good look. some of the rest of the supporting cast isn't too bad but overall I liked it for the spectacle and some of the story.",1401840000,2014-06-04

A woman fertility doctor who can't have children steals one of the cloned embrios and implants it in her womb in the womens toilet. Cut to 'seven years later'. The boy heals a dead mouse.

2.0,"What in the world are ""progressive polygamists,"" as the Williamses, the subjects of this series, claim to be? Seems like a contradiction in terms.Polygamy is not a progressive lifestyle by any means, never was and never will be. It's a male-centered lifestyle, in which all the women--and, in this case, 24 (!) children--fight for one man's attention. I can understand people practicing polygamy because it's their religious conviction to do so, as the Browns from Sister Wives claim, but the Williamses say they no longer hold true to the doctrines of Fundamental Mormonism, or the FLDS church. So they apparently now choose this lifestyle--or, as I see it, it's too late to change things. So now what?Are they stuck? Must be because what woman in her right mind would choose to share her husband with four other women if it's not something she believes will get her into heaven for time and all eternity? I wonder what this family is teaching the children.That it's OK for a man to have a number of women even though it's not dictated by their religion or condoned by society? (Do these ""progressives"" also believe it's OK for a woman to have multiple husbands?) And what religion do they now practice? Surely, there is no other Christian religion that is OK with polygamy. This family seems a bit of a jumble.A lot of reviewers claim the women, who are all cousins born in polygamous families in the same region of Utah in which the clan currently resides, appear to be depressed, and I would concur. Paulie is lovely, but she rarely cracks a smile and seems to not enjoy being in front of the camera. Rosemary is at least truthful. I like her honesty regarding jealousy and weight issues. Nonie is harsh, but seems bright. Rhonda and Robyn are kind and sweet but they too have that same glazed expression as the others.Several episodes into the season, we haven't learned much about the children, though. They're not really featured in the story lines and no one child stands out above the others. The boys tend to be unruly and it's understandable, as the family has no table around which to eat and mealtimes often become chaotic. Manners fall by the wayside. (You'd think contractor Brady could build one dining hall for the entire family to eat in instead of having to hold plates on laps.)Brady, who does not seem to be all that charismatic or appealing, tries to appease all the women. Of course that is impossible, we all know that. And every conversation when there's a problem or disagreement among the women or they with Brady seems staged. He seems to be reading from some conflict resolution handbook every time he answers them. He always says, ""I hear what you're saying,"" and then he repeats their grievance and gives some kind of wishy-washy answer but that is often just what the woman wants to hear. His responses, frankly, don't seem natural and I wonder if he would be so kind and understanding if the cameras weren't filming.Despite what appears to be playing to the cameras, some of the women claim that he is not always very fair--and it does appear that he has favorites--but how is it possible to love five women at once and be fair to everyone? It's the lifestyle in and of itself that doesn't promote fairness.",1398038400,2014-04-21
4.0,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSDecoded is the perfect show to me -- part mystery, part adventure, a little fun and all conspiracy. As I get older I see conspiracy in just about everything and it makes me feel good to know I'm not alone.Led by Brad Meltzer, author and investigator -- Scott Rolle, U.S. Army Reserves Major and trial attorney; Christine McKinley, mechanical engineer and writer and Buddy Levy,  English professor and journalist are in search of the truth.Their first adventure in season 2 takes them to the Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. According to our explorers no one has been in the vault and seen the gold since 1974. They know if the gold is no longer there, it could devastate the nation's economy.Some of my favorite episodes include:Vatican --  They investigate rumors that the Vatican could have been involved in the death of Pope John Paul I, who was only on the job 33 days before he was found dead of mysterious causes. They also expose possible ties to the Freemasons and the Mafia.Mafia: Alive? -- Brad's team start with Al Capone and search to the present to see if the Mafia is really gone, or just taken on a different image. It appears they've become high-tech criminals, stealing identities and money off the internet. I can buy that.2012: It Has Begun -- This is pretty far-fetched to me.

4.0,"I'm not a huge John John Malkovich fan, but this seems like one of those rare occasions when actor and role seem perfectly matched to produce an entertaining movie. Malkovich plays Buck Howard, a failing magician loosely based on the Amazing Kreskin. Malkovich's character is both corny and charming. He undergoes a transformation from being frustrated with his fate of performing for small-town America, to finding the his big break didn't necessarily bring him what he most needed. Meanwhile, Colin Hanks (Tom Hank's son) plays a young man searching for himself after dropping out of law school. Ultimately, this movie isn't a slapstick comedy and you probably won't find yourself laughing out loud.

Some examples of the theories presented are: a Holocaust subtext, genocide of American Indians, subliminal sexual  imagery, repeated Minotaur imagery, and the idea that Stanley Kubrick has left clues to his complicity in faked Apollo 11 moon landing footage in &#8220;The Shining&#8221;.It goes without saying that some of these theories are more plausible than others. I don&#8217;t know anyone who has seen &#8220;The Shining&#8221; who didn&#8217;t get the impression that the film alluded to some injustice done to American Indians, as the Overlook Hotel was purportedly built on an American Indian burial ground, whose tribe attempted to defend it. And there is deliberate American Indian imagery in the film &#8211;a picture on a wall, cans of Calumet baking soda on a shelf, for example. The Holocaust was a big mass murder or attempted genocide that occurred in Kubrick&#8217;s formative years, so it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if he incorporated some imagery of Nazi Germany, consciously or unconsciously, into a film in which images of death and fear of death play a big role.I have to admit that the theory that Stanley Kubrick shot fake moon landing footage of the Apollo 11 mission and hid clues to that fact in &#8220;The Shining&#8221;, whose themes reflect Kubrick&#8217;s personal dilemma in doing secret work for the government and having to hide it from everyone is entertaining. Some of the other theories are not so entertaining. Some of the &#8220;evidence&#8221; to support these theories cannot be seen unless you view the movie frame-by-frame, which Kubrick probably did not do. Many have obvious and mundane explanations. Some are continuity errors that Kubrick probably didn&#8217;t care about &#8211;or perhaps thought they were funny. The point that Juli Kearns makes that the internal lay-out of the hotel is impossible (she tried to map it) is true and noticeable when watching the film.I like to hear the theories by obsessive &#8220;Shining&#8221; fans. And watching the clips from &#8220;The Shining&#8221; reminded me of what a beautiful film that was. But, ultimately, I felt that these theories would have been better expressed as essays, which they probably were originally. I got the impression that the narrators developed their theories online, at fan web sites. It is helpful to be able to see what they are referring to in &#8220;The Shining&#8221; as they explain it. However, the filmmakers&#8217; attempt to organize the theories into 9 parts doesn&#8217;t work well. It seems scattershot and disorganized. The film jumps from theory to theory and back again, and narrators are recognized only by their voices and their theory, which is sometimes confusing. And &#8220;Room 237&#8221; is too long by half an hour.The DVD (MPI Home Video 2013): There is an audio commentary by Kevin &#8220;mstrmnd&#8221; McLeod, who is another &#8220;Shining&#8221; theorist. He declined to be interviewed for the film, but he has contributed an audio track with his theories as well as comments on this film. I didn&#8217;t listen to the whole thing, but what I heard was thoughtful and worth a listen if you want to hear more theorizing. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH and Spanish. There is also a trailer included on the disc (1  min). I believe there are more bonus features on Disc 2 DVD and on the Blu Ray.",1384992000,2013-11-21

5.0,"Justified just keeps getting better by the season, the characters and situations encountered by our heros (I'm including the other Marshall's) just keeps getting better and better.

4.0,"If I could give you only a single reason to see The Great Buck Howard it would be John Malkovich. As one of the most respected actors working today, Malkovich is probably best known for roles playing a bad guy or, at least, a very angry guy...The role of Buck Howard shows a different side of Malkovich, but it's one that is completely delightful.Colin Hanks plays Troy, who one day decides to quit law school with the intent of becoming a writer. To support himself, Troy must find a job. The opportunity comes along in the form of Buck Howard, a mentalist (""magician is a dirty word"") who in his prime appeared on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson 61 times. Now the Great Buck Howard plays small venues with even smaller crowds. Troy becomes Buck's assistant, quietly observing the man who doesn't seem to realize that his days of being great are behind him.It's a simple, low-budget movie that doesn't have anything profound to say but, none-the-less kept me thoroughly entertained.Emily Blunt, Ricky Jay, Steve Zahn, and Tom Hanks (as Troy's father, go figure) round out the principal cast, but despite solid performances from all; this is Malkovich's show.Yes, he's playing against type but there is a certain amount of joy I got from watching him in this role. Buck is not a multi-faceted character; we only really get a look at the stage persona. Troy knows Buck about as well as we do, but Malkovich allows us to see the passion and frustration of the character, even with it barely there. The man is an absolute marvel, truly one of the finest living actors.Is the film great though? No, it's not. It's not a character study or a laugh-out-loud comedy. It's not even very original and some of it's even predictable. However, it has enough charm and wit to warrant recommending it. Buck Howard is a great character and it is a delightful little movie. Tom Arnold's cameo is almost worth the price of a rental, by itself.The Great Buck Howard is not great, but much like the fictional Buck's show; it's disarmingly funny, charming, and very amusing.GRADE: B",1248998400,2009-07-31
5.0,This is a great series &#34;who-done-it&#34; that combines the FBI working in conjunction with forensic anthropologists to figure out how a murder happens each episode.  It also mixes in the private lives of several of the FBI and anthropologists which is very entertaining.  This is another series I am completely hooked on.  Give this series a try; you will love it!,1395705600,2014-03-25
4.0,"Justified has a great cast an opportunity to be as good as the day it started, but the stories remain too similar and the characters are not moving forward with as much gusto as I would like. With that being said I am still enthralled by each new episode.",1383264000,2013-11-01

4.0,"BROWSERS has good potential to become a regular show for me. The characters are generally likable and the dialogue was quirky and fun. The songs were decent. The lip-synching is a little off-putting as its not on cue for most of it, but generally permissible. The show surrounds a group of interns who want to work at the trendy Daily Gush, an online gossip column. For me, to have about 4 or 5 songs in a 25-minute comedy seems a little heavy on the music and less on the character interactions as they should be developing each character more.Given its a pilot episode, I find it just as good as anything you would find on TV and I will certainly watch the next episode.",1366588800,2013-04-22

5.0,"Definitely my favorite seasons were seasons one through six.  The supporting cast was terrific and the story lines superb.

5.0,"This promises to be as good as The Closer because we have most of the cast still intact, but also have the full time addition of Mary McDonnell, a truly accomplished actress (two time Oscar nominee).  She plays a fascinating character, eccentric, about 55-ish in age so lacking the vanity found in a younger actress, and able to command the men around her who feel they perhaps should have her job.  The two episodes I have seen so far have been great.",1345507200,2012-08-21

3.0,"Surprisingly restrained considering the trailer had so many threatening and spooky images. I will say that 'The Orphanage' does get an A for atmosphere, but reading subtitles during this film distracted me from the experience. I usually pass on films with subtitles, but this film seemed too good to pass up and there are always exceptions to the rule. It's a pretty easy film to follow, even though this was played up to be a very spooky film, I found it to be more sad than scary. The DVD transfer looks very good and this is worth seeing, but maybe rent before buying it.",1230681600,2008-12-31

I only hope that the writers can keep giving us the scary outlaws, character arcs, and challenges to Raylan's morality without ruining my favorite cowboy hat-wearing Marshall.

5.0,"The touch of Elmore Leonard is evident in the characterization and plot development of this series.  We love and hate almost everyone from one minute to the next.  There is no limit to the evil potential and the possibilities for disaster and betrayal.  Violence is a premise, but this is the wild West in Kentucky.  Interesting, engrossing, sometimes charming, sometimes revolting.  Keep watching!",1394323200,2014-03-09

5.0,"This movie is proof that if a movie isn't marketed correctly it won't succeed at the theatres. I loved the suspense, and Samuel L. Jackson played evil so convincingly, that it was, at times, terrifying to even look at him. This is probably a lower budget movie but I loved it! Great ending too! Don't be fooled by the fact that it didn't get top billing at the theatre. Neither did Galaxy Quest, but it is now a cult classic.If you enjoy this type of genre, Samuel L Jackson (Truly at his most evil), and surprise endings, watch this movie. If you are a Prime member you get to see it free, so you lose nothing. Really enjoyable film!",1350604800,2012-10-19

2.0,"Jack Begosian (Andy Garcia) is a former CIA operative who has retired to Toronto and hosts an all-night talk-radio show.  Hey, why not?  For nearly all the movie he anguishes about something in his CIA past, but never tells us any specifics.  At the same time, way down in Ecuador, Francisco Francis (Forest Whitaker) and his wife Mia (rifle toting Eva Longoria) are being chased by the army for undermining a Canadian water purification project headed by evil capitalist Bruce Swinton (Kim Coates).It seems that the huge water corporation screwed things up and allowed typhus to enter the water system, killing many locals.  If that wasn't bad enough, a corrupt general is executing any and all who try to escape.  Tipped off by a suicidal escapee, Swinton's sister, and major stockholder, Morgan (Deborah Kara Unger) convinces Jack with some big bucks to exfiltrate the Francis family, shedding light on the dirty business.  Jack reluctantly accepts the assignment realizing it will give him an opportunity to correct what happened when he was last in South America.  Oh, and the big bucks.While much of the photography is excellent, writer and director Damian Lee bungle the production with a ridiculous script.  Unger doesn't help much with her dour characterization that never changes from a zoned out aristocrat.  Garcia is much better, especially given the words he has to work with.  Kevin Durand is a hired assassin who changes direction, one that is easily foreseen.  Even with its heart in the right place, the film is preachy to a fault.",1366070400,2013-04-16

1.0,"Given this was a pilot, I would think they are trying to put their best foot forward in order to get the powers that be to go ahead with production. Well all I can say is that if this was their best effort, this is a doomed undertaking. There was nothing about the characters that i found appealing and the plot was both slow moving and humorless. Better luck next time.",1400544000,2014-05-20
5.0,"This whole concept has worked and that was a long shot. After all this Sherlock is different in many ways to the superdetective of the stories.  Still, I like the way the show has progressed , throughout the second series.  The characters have changed as you would expect them to. The cast remains strong and interesting. So it will be back for another round in September. I would say this one will last for years to come.  If you enjoy interesting character driven shows , then this is up your alley.",1399766400,2014-05-11
5.0,This show captivated my attention from the beginning! All of the cast are well suited for their roles and give a very believable performance. The pilot starts out right away with action and a story that has substance. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys historical fiction.,1365811200,2013-04-13
5.0,"I bought the series on the strength and fondness I had for Sean Hayes performance on Will and Grace.  I wish the network had given this show more time to gain an audience following.  I thought the ensemble casting was brilliant, even though it was reported that Hayes and Linda Lavin didn't get along.  This show was of a quirky nature that I think some of the cast gave breakout performances that could have made it a hit.  I'm casting my memory back to Caroline in the City which might not have had a chance without Malcolm Getz as Richard.  In my opinion Thomas Lennon and Echo Kellum carried this show and given a chance it could have propelled their careers to new heights.  Why must networks cancel funny clever shows?  We as viewers were not even given the opportunity of viewing the entire season.  The scripts were clever and funny;  even a little bawdy in a good way.  Show 5, ""Nobody Puts Sean in the Corner"" was laugh out loud funny.  I wish Jim Burrows had stayed on as director, maybe this show might have had a better outcome.  I highly recommend all the shows of this series that are available, as I beleive 2-3 may never see the light of day",1398211200,2014-04-23
1.0,"Thought this might be entertaining and funny but it was just a too realistic view of people solely focused on themselves and the awful, hurtful behavior that goes along with those types of priorities.

The first season, which premiered in 2011, features 6 episodes based on actual cases involving stalking.  The stories vary in scope and type, and although males are typically the perpetrators, stalkers of both genders are featured.Like other true crime programs, the episodes feature interviews with those involved, along with reenactments featuring actors.  The stories are usually concerned with strange, often obsessive behavior, and are somewhat interesting, as people can do some weird things.  Matters do not become extremely violent, but while it's available on Prime, those interested in true crime might want to see if this program has any appeal.",1378598400,2013-09-08

5.0,"Im not going to write a long review. And i am not going to compare it to novels or as in one review that actually got four stars,  talk about how much carnage there is, and how long it will take for some sick person to copy what they see on tv?  This is what everyone is giving 4 stars for?  The story is about a guy who is a genius.  He has a cult.  ""The Following""......Kevin Bacon a once, I think FBI agent, left the force, and was called back to help catch this guy and bring him in. But just cause he is in jail, doesn't mean his cult is not fully planned and doing as instructed. The force with Bacon's help is trying to solve all these bad things that keep coming up all through great planning of this psychopath.....In short Im sure we all have seen something like this in a movie at some point. But as for tv?  I think it's fresh, and Bacon and im sorry i don't remember his real name (the bad guy in jail), he is just amazing and perfect for this role. could not get any better than him. All the acting in this is First class all the way.  Very entertaining. This show will last as long as Bacon stays on. It's a six year contract. So if you like action, police shows, a little bit of cult thrown at you, then i think you will love this show. It's actually a rush. It moves fast when it needs to, and slows up for really intense moments. You really get to enjoy each scene. Great writing i think.  It is certainly worth at least watching the first two episodes to see if you like it.  My only complaint, is i wish they allowed Bacon a little more room to act.  Meaning to open up just a little. I understand he has a rough past, but allow him character to let one of the agents closer to him even a little. It will also allow Bacon to use more of his acting skills.  Great show.

5.0,"A gray and dystopic future, evil megacorp taking over the world and the people in it - OK, that part's been done. 'Metropia' stands out for doing it brilliantly. It's a lot more than that, though.Animation has explored the super-realistic, with just enough success that the discrepancies become especially jarring. This goes farther, well into the surreal. That allows for exaggerations of faces and figures, wide-eyed blankness and evil scowls that wouldn't be phyiscally possible for human actors. And, despite great advances in computer-aided post-production, animators can build their worlds from the ground up in the image they want, with no need to retrofit them into scraps of reality. This movie really does use animation in a novel and very distinctive way.Very enjoyable in many ways. Certainly not one for the kiddies, it scarcely qualifies as as ""adult"" movie - but body-shy viewers might have trouble with brief- and semi-nudity.-- wiredweird",1336608000,2012-05-10
3.0,"If you have already seen the competing versions of this new tv show, you might start paling on the very idea of viewing yet another one. This is based on Jason Mott's novel which involves a small boy returning to his home decades after he drowned and died there. His parents are now old people but they do recognize him as their child. This is just the opening salvo as the formerly dead start showing up everywhere. Are they zombies, aka The Walking Dead? Well, if they are it is not obvious yet. But the fact that there are so many of them creates a growing problem. In this new ABC show and in the French LES REVENANTS (THE RETURNED) the essential plot point is identical. The new people are in exactly the same shape as when they died and the same age. They want to pick up their lives right where they left off. This throws the other people for a big loop as you might expect.So we start out knowing that France already had an incredibly similar series, LES REVENANTS (THE RETURNED), which aired about two years ago in France and a few months ago on Sundance. It was critically and popularly a hit but it was in French language and subtitled which means less of an audience. It featured a young girl who had died who returns to her home after she has risen from the dead.  She too is followed by others of her kind. Again, unknown if they are zombies but there is something off about them which eventually shows on their skins.About a year ago the BBC aired a show called IN THE FLESH which was about zombies cured and maintained by the socialist government, much like the AIDS virus is today. This was successful in the UK and BBC America. This was very good as it had a satirical element to it. There is of course AMC's ratings juggernaut THE WALKING DEAD which is about surviving in an actual zombie overrun earth, which is similar to the novel and movie WORLD WAR Z, written by Max Brooks and starring Brad Pitt. The novel was outstanding and the movie was good. There is also a movie called THE RETURNED which has the zombies controlled by medication but then the RX runs out. It was also very good.My biggest problem, having seen all of the above, is I have reached the melt down point with zombie or risen from the dead tv shows and movies.  There are just too many of them. If you have not seen all of the above, you are probably going to be more receptive to this new ABC show than I am. This reminds me of decades ago when tv was dominated by westerns.  It was so over saturated with them that getting a western made afterwards became the hardest sell in the business.  We may be heading there with zombies.What is the very best of all this zombie media? For me nothing beats Max Brooks' novel WORLD WAR Z. It is the book you must read as the movie is quite different. Max Brooks has become a cult figure with young people on college campuses as a result of these books and his talks are huge hits.  You cannot be into zombies and skip reading this book.Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

1.0,"The following is taken from the comments I made on the survey. &#34;Mozart&#34; was a huge disappointment on all fronts except for Malcolm McDowell and even this script is far from being suited for his best work.

4.0,"Its hard not to compare this show to the Following with Kevin Bacon. On the surface, they're very similar. Tortured main character, gruesome murders, creepy psychopaths. Yet, they are, in essence, nothing alike. Bacon's character is a cliche. Will Graham, the protagonist in Hannibal, is so beautifully drawn, I can't take my eyes off him. He is a ""special investigator"" with the FBI. Those who work with him see him as fragile, so much so that they all seem to be holding their collective breath, waiting for him to shatter. The thing that makes him weak in their eyes is his stunning depth of empathy. This is how he solves crimes. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist (and future notorious psychopath) who works with the FBI and Graham, has a different perspective. When Graham asks ""how do you see me?"", Lecter replies, you are ""the mongoose I want under the house when the snakes slither by.""The production quality is high, the supporting cast is great. The show is smartly written.",1365724800,2013-04-12

3.0,"Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's big-screen collaborations with director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu have produced a trio of highly accomplished films -Amores Perros,21 Grams, andBabel- that juxtaposed several storylines, all tied together by characters who were damaged souls in search of redemption and connection with one another. Although the two had a very public falling-out, Arriaga still appears to be strongly influenced by his former partner's jumbled filmmaking style as he takes over the director's chair with this 2009 drama. The chief problem, however, is that Arriaga doesn't really show I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's passion and audacity as he attempts to pull off the considerable demands of a non-linear narrative with conviction. Moreover, Arriaga the screenwriter lets down Arriaga the director with a script that ultimately feels too predictable and contrived despite strong performances from the cast.There looks to be four separate stories at the outset, which eventually transitions into two. The first involves Sylvia, the manager of an upscale, seaside restaurant in Portland, an extremely pained woman who prefers casual sex followed by self-inflicted punishment. She is obviously anguished over something that motivates her erratic behavior. The second thread takes place in New Mexico near the Mexican border where Gina, an unhappily married mother of four, is carrying on an affair with a local man named Nick, also married with children. The complication here is that her daughter Mariana finds out about the affair and embarks on a relationship with Nick's son Santiago. Meanwhile, in Mexico, a crop-duster plane crash-lands on an open field, as his twelve-year-old daughter Maria watches in horror.Arriaga's fractured approach works for a little while albeit in an emotionally draining, humorless way. However, when the moment of revelation arrives (and much too early), the plot unravels into a Lifetime TV-movie level of sanctimony obscured by the fiery explosion that gives the movie its name. Proving yet again that a beautiful woman can convincingly expose the torment of a soul under fire, Charlize Theron successfully makes the nihilistic Sylvia an ultimately sympathetic figure. Kim Basinger, looking entirely too stunning and wrinkle-free at 55 to be a K-Mart-shopping housewife, manages to get to the heart of a guilt-ridden woman, even as she shows Gina going through the predictable machinations of her illicit actions.The stand-out performance, however, comes from Jennifer Lawrence, a Jewel look-alike, as the troubled teen Mariana, the dramatic pivot for the whole movie. Tessa Ia makes a strong impression as the pensive Maria, while the men barely make a ripple - John Corbett as a smitten sous-chef in Sylvia's restaurant, Joaquim de Almeida as the passionate Nick, Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Yazpik as the go-between Carlos, and Danny Pino as the pilot. The one exception is J.D. Pardo who plays Santiago as the impetuous Romeo to Lawrence's Juliet. Robin Tunney shows up in a smallish role as Sylvia's one true friend. Robert Elswit and John Toll share cinematography responsibilities here, and they do an excellent job capturing all the locales. At the end of the movie, I couldn't help thinking that Arriaga's yin was fundamentally missing I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's yang.",1250985600,2009-08-23

5.0,"The same year that the Conan reboot was released, a limited theater film based on the same author's works was released entitled Solomon Kane. Based of the swashbuckling pirate-turned-evil slayer, the film depicts Solomon as a criminal who renounces violence in order to keep his soul from being taken by the Devil's Reaper, who had already arrived to claim his soul. But when a family Kane cares about is attacked and the daughter taken, Kane returns to his violent ways to save the girl, but at the cost of his soul.Written and directed by Michael J. Basset, Solomon Kane is a fantastic, lower budgeted film that succeeds where the new Conan failed in every way. The script was not Oscar-worthy, but it was memorable and fun, with nothing dumb or unnecessary. Basset's directing was superb as well, capturing the 17th century as a dark, gloomy and eerie time where evil was hiding everywhere. The acting was great, especially James Purefoy who plays Kane. Broken, ashamed and good-hearted, Purefoy gives us a character that is a mix of Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing and Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher; he's a guy who you do not mess with, and will do whatever it takes to make sure the right thing is done, even if it means killing. The music by Klaus Badelt is amazing, and I am saddened that they have not released the score; it's a mix of Howard Shore's The Hobbit and James Newton Howard's Snow White & the Huntsman. The visual effects, while decent in some places (due to the budget) are very, very impressive in others, especially the Fire Demon at the end of the film.Overall, Solomon Kane is a wildly thrilling roller-coaster that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. They need to create a sequel to this because, even though it didn't recoup its budget at the box office (because the distributors are idiots) there is so much potential and more tales that they can adapt to the screen, maybe even making a trilogy to match Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy. Please, epic fantasy fans, action fans and period piece fans, watch this movie and help spread the word. They devoted their time and put their hearts into this movie; lets show them fans do care4.5/5 Stars",1374364800,2013-07-21

3.0,"Note: I have seen every episode of this show in HD via XFinity On Demand.WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!After a fantastic debut season, minus the disgusting and unneccessary gay romances, could SMASH maintain the momentum and story for season II? Well, it's no fault of the actors and writers. They certainly tried their hardest, and for the most part, it worked very well. The episodes were finely structured, and the characters more than two-dimensioned. Some traits, however, came completely out of left field and were entirely unneccessary, both from a creative and dramatic standpoint. Example: It was so never hinted at that Kyle was gay until he's seen kissing a guy in a bar, who shortly thereafter breaks up with him because he sodomised another man, and the scenes of guys kissing each other, and being in bed next to each other were totally unneccessary, as they added NOTHING to the plot, and above all, they're immoral, both socially, and Biblically. The Bible saith, ""Thou shalt not lie with a man as one lieth with a woman; it is abomination."" The show could have succeeded without that garbage in it. However, that is the only fly in the ointment of what was otherwise a spectacular television series. Kyle was a sympathetic character, and I think he & Karen would have been a perfect couple, had things not worked out with Derek & Karen.I was very disappointed with how the show ended things, in terms of relationships. Karen & Derek should have ended up together, Jimmy should have died, along with Sam (good idea to excise him for a number of episodes; shame that it wasn't permanent, though). Tom also should have gotten a girlfriend, and stayed with her. The drama with Daisy should have been explored more (I would loved to have seen the coup the dancers did against her, and the confrontation between her and Jerry when Derek tells her that there's been a change of plan. Season I had a lot of great songs. Season II, though, not so much. The quality of the storylines were still strong, minus the gay b.s., but the overall quality of good songs just seemed to drop drastically, though there were some good ones. So, in regard to the male/male gay stuff aspect of the show, SAYONARA, PIGS!!! Good luck finding another mudhole. Katharine McPhee, Jack Davenport, Debra Messing and Anjelica Huston were really good in this show, and Ms. McPhee has a big future ahead of her.Rated TV-14 (gay people kissing & in bed, moderate profanity).",1370131200,2013-06-02

5.0,"Hmmm. Well, the plots are good, I'm enjoying the jump into Celtic mythology, Stiles is perking up, very involved in figuring it all out, but obviously it is going to take time. Lydia has joined Stiles as a part of the super brain trust dyad, that'll be fun to watch. The most recent episode I've watched, Motel California, revealed a lot of background on our werewolf teammates. Creepy episode with a lot of triggers, and daring. Once again Lydia and Stiles work together, this time with Allison, to ride to the rescue. Lydia has the absolute best horror-face. Stiles is so much better with each episode. He's going nuts with the snarking, he and Coach were especially watchable.Allison. The redemption arc. Huh. It is as if last season never happened. Well, there have been a few small mentions, but the girl went homicidally nuts last season. If you want me to believe she is all better, give me some more gut wrenching scenes. I do like seeing her and Lydia closer, bonding more. She is also sneaking around saving her werewolf buddies. OK. Maybe I'm starting to like her again.Scott has changed for the better, a far more likely Alpha candidate than he was when Derek mockingly called him an Alpha of his own pack. And there is more Stiles and Scott best friend time. The Scott/Stiles bromance in this last ep was fantastic, real tears! Great dynamic. Isaac and Scott are pretty cool to watch, too. Scott's voice is apparently Isaac's anodyne. Isaac is flourishing tho  little easy to anger, great closet scene, and how can he still be so beautiful. I swear the boys are even more so than the girls in this show. Wow.I think Jeff Davis still hates Derek and all things having to do with Stiles and Derek bromancing. A shame. They've had some of the best scenes in the first 2 seasons. Holding out hope for more this season. Stiles&Derek; scenes being replaced with Jennifer/Derek scenes... not fair substitute. Really not much in the way of heat between J/D. But again Derek is just lovely to watch. (For heat check out the way Isaac and Allison are looking at each other.)I do question what woman (Jennifer) in her right mind looks at a guy who is covered in wounds, bleeding black blood, who looks ""like you are dying"" and decides to jump his bones. Ugh, too icky. Something is not right with Ms Blake. She looks a little too True Blood hungry. Hope Derek is not about to be the Scooby snack again. With the new Alphas flooding in...the girl who rescued Isaac, and Cora, do we really need a gutsy new teach...Ms Blake, for Derek to (oddly, inexplicably) stalk/dally with (while looking that bored, Derek)? Maybe her role is one not so innocent. Guess we'll have to wait and see. If she turns out to be a baddie...then I'm back to the Derek is the exec producer's scapegoat again. Which I mourn, Derek is a great character, let him grow, don't stab him at every turn. Ms Blake as a sweet little love interest, doesn't fit. Wouldn't be at all surprised to see her eyes glow red.The Alpha Pack brought in quite a few new characters. It seems in order to be a member you need to kill the rest of your pack and take over their abilities. Hmm. Well, I find the Druid storyline far more interesting than the Alpha Pack. Dealing with a bunch of homicidal meanies/serial killers... well it is getting old. Kali's toenails are gross. The enforcer type Ennis was very one dimensional, and now is gone, gone, the twins certainly aren't one dimensional, at least they are getting more screen time which involves actual interaction and speech. Duke, is clearly unhinged, sticking his fingers into his own packmate's brain after his benediction kisses is the final proof of that, if we needed any more. It has been slow going, but he is finally creeping up to rival Uncle Peter as the guy to keep your eyes on. What can one say about Peter? That man can play it over the top without looking like an idiot. Duke...well, OTT, but getting better. In fact the whole Alpha Pack, OTT. And I don't think I'll ever get over the toenails.Looks like the Twins are going to have a conversion to the light side arc. But to tell the truth...Danny and Lydia, worth turning for, right? Amazingly hot Danny Ethan scene. Wow. Again. But, way tooo short. Seen way more on TV, right? Oh well, sweet is good.Derek got beat down again, tortured (see this Davis-no-like-theme?). His newly arrived sister is not listening to him, instead being a teenager, and a brat. Of course it is easy to see that the Hale family doesn't make calm, rational decisions much. Not any more. Derek is being noble, sacrificing himself, Cora is brash and doesn't know she is unprepared, Peter is up to something.Derek threw out Isaac, who is literally the loyalest of his betas, his little bud. I am disappointed. Sure, he might just be trying to save Isaac's life, doesn't want to be forced to kill him...but really, do you have to be such a jerk about it? Use your words, explain it. I thought Derek was thinking things through and might actually team up with Scott, Stiles, Isaac, Boyd, Cora, Deaton....and get something solid done. Maybe I can still have that hope. It just doesn't sit well with me to have Derek soloing again.Finally we get a peek at the Darach, too. Engulfed in fire, and maybe a little bit mad? Even worse, Gerard is still alive. NO! Aaaand, Ms Morrell is up to no good.Now we get to episode 9. God. Derek sure can pick them. More great stuff. Still a 5 star show. What an intro for the sheriff into the world of the supernaturals, huh?So much eye candy. Take the time to watch the eps again, mini-marathon makes them better all over again.",1372118400,2013-06-25

5.0,"im a late comer in most shows. but im not  wealthy so for entertainment i watch tv, and movies. and im old enough to have watched a lot over the years. there are a few key components for the making of hit show. the writing of course has to be good. but what has come with it, and this is every bit as important as the writing itself, maybe more so. and that is the people chosen to play the characters. if you look at almost any show, even sitcoms, it is the chemistry between  people that makes us drawn to the show. for example, i believe we all love the idea of friendship and find it hard to find even one person that you can fully trust and call friend through out life. shows that were hits all had good writing, sometimes not, but had people playing the characters that were really good at bringing the friendship and trust to the screen. look at happy days, lavern and shirley, seinfeld, cheers, mash, house, bones, friends, and finally nypd blue. these are only a few examples. what do they all have in common? the relationships between any two people, or in the case of friends many friendships between many people. i love nypd blue, and although the writer had a drinking problem and it did affect his writing, the people carried the show because they were so good at bringing the characters such as sipowitz and john kelley, or bobby simone. the friendships that sipowitz had over the years on that show i believe is what really draws us in. in my case, when watching i have found myself searching in my own mind the question, do i have that kind of friendship? and wanting to watch and see how they look out for one another and without almost never saying it, you know they care about each other like family. i think that is the key to any drama or sitcom for that matter. having the right actors, and their ability to bring that level of emotion and caring for each other that we all look for in our own lives. an example of this can be found in house. before the writers strike with house, it was a hit show, and winning awards. why? hugh laurie or house and his relationship with wilson, his best friend, and cuddy. then you have the supporting cast of cameron, chase, and forman. but its the relationship between house and wilson that really brings us closer and gives us the laughs we enjoy by watching, and relate to in our own lives. its the friendship, and the flirtation with cuddy, and how he interacts with his supporting cast that we have come to love. BUT, if you look at when they broke up the crew, the writers strike happend, chase, cameron, and forman had next to no time with house. also, they took away the witty exchange with wilson and cuddy. the dynamic of the show changed. the ratings dropped, people wrote and called in their fustration with the direction the show was taking. the writers essentially ruined the chemistry between the key characters. the friendships and relationships that we all related to, or hoped for in our own lives was no longer there. ratings dont lie. so, my long way of making my point is this: the show ""lie to me"" is very unique. first the writing is good. not great. i think they can improve and have a lot of material to draw off of. but the people who play the characters really make that show a hit. from day one, they have been developing the friendships and relationships between the characters and i believe as long as they keep moving in this direction it will be a great hit. the concept and or idea of the show is very unique. nothing like it before has ever hit the small screen. making my point in friendship, they even brought in the actor from ER to be like a second partner, but male not female, and you can see how they are becoming better friends and learning to trust each other.  forgive me i cant remember his name at the moment, but the lead character lightman now has a FBI guy to lean on, and you can see they felt they needed him to have that connection like they did on nypd blue. lightman has the one woman he trusts, but they oscillate between flirtation and friendship. with the FBI its two guys depending on each other. partners like you would find in any police unit. and i believe they give us all the components for a great tv series. the friendship, a unique concept in telling the truth, and the story lines in which to bring out all the things we can relate to in our own lives. plus its damn funny too. its a great cast, great idea in terms of what lightman does, and i believe if the writers keep moving forward, keep the characters growing letting us in a little at a time, and bring that friendship to the front with his FBI agent it will be on for many years to come. i love the show and plan on buying the series. five stars from me. but then im just a guy with a little too much time on my hands.",1268438400,2010-03-13
5.0,"Ever since last season when Artie used the astrolabe to keep the warehouse from being destroyed he has been plagued by the consequences in the form of an unspecfied ""evil"" being released and in Brother Adrian, the monk who swears that he will make certain that Artie pays the consequences for his actions.In this episode, the penultimate episode before the mid-season finale, Adrian attacks the warehouse by attacking the people that Artie loves, the warehouse denizens, by attacking the people they love. Thus, Myks goes off to save her sister, Claudia her brother and Pete his ex-wife. The artifacts used against family members are clever and difficult to spot and defuse and that alone would make this a good episode, but the real action takes place at the warehouse where Brother Adrian is stalking Artie through the aisles and artifacts continue to disappear. Lena is with Artie and what happens when Brother Adrian is finally revealed makes for heartbreaking television.Warehouse 13 has come into its own the last two seasons. It has always been a lot of fun with its steampunk elements and its magical warehouse but the show has really raised the stakes in the last two seasons in terms of both plot and character. Must see steampunk science fiction.",1349049600,2012-10-01
5.0,"This was a series that came with a lot of potential, a lot of expectations, and a lot of anxiety; most of it derived from Joss Whedon's involvement and the fact that it exists in the same continuity as the Marvel films -- a multi-billion-dollar franchise including The Avengers, Iron Man 1,2 & 3, Capt. America: The First Avenger & The Winter Soldier, Thor (the crappy original) & Thor 2 (which was quite good), and of course, The Incredible Hulk films (which have been far from incredible, a frustration for fans and film-makers; even talented people like Ang Lee, Edward Norton & Eric Bana couldn't make it work, although Mark Ruffalo's Hulk worked perfectly as one star in The Avengers' constellation).Then there are the other corners of the Marvel Universe not directly tied to The Avengers, most notably the brilliant reboot of the X-Men with First Class & Days of Future Past, as well as Bryan Singer's original X-Men trilogy and the respectable Wolverine films; but no one could forget the character and the movies that got things going for Marvel fims, the Sam Raimi/Toby Maguire Spiderman Trilogy (Critical and Box-Office over-achievers), followed by the unnecessary, unasked for, and unsatisfying remakes; then we're left with the Fantastic Four movies (ugh...) and fringe-dwellers like Blade (the first was decent, but Guillermo del Toro's sequel was excellent. As for the third...).When you take into account the catastrophic mess that notorious Wall Street bandit Ron Perelman left Marvel in a few years after taking the company public -- part of a media conglomerate, their fortunes tied to baseball card companies while the league was on strike, and the once-booming speculative market bubble now popped, leaving them on the verge of bankruptcy -- it is remarkable that the 'House of Ideas' survived to see the new millennium. Perelman diverted profits to another company in the conglomerate and walked away with 280 000 000$. After filing for bankruptcy on Dec.27,1996, things could only get better. And they did. Just 12 years later, Marvel was acquired by Disney as a LLC for nearly five billion dollars.The deep pockets were necessary for Agents of SHIELD to be successful. After establishing an ultra-high-tech, very slick style for the films, the series would have to maintain a similar aesthetic. It must have taken a lot of money and hard work, because the show-runners managed to pull it off, with all the cool weapons and alien devices and super-spy tactical vehicles that SHIELD should have at their disposal.One of the best moves they made was focusing on the very human agents trying to deal with the 'new reality' of living in a world where super-powered humans, aliens and gods not only exist, but do battle in and above the cities of Earth. Obviously, having the A-list heroes and villains in the series was not an option (Iron Man might appear, but not Tony Stark; The Hulk could drop in, but Bruce Banner would not, if you get my point), unless you replaced the all-star movie cast with no-star TV versions, and that wouldn't make anyone happy. Instead, we get the seemingly miraculous resurrection of Agent Phil Coulson (played with the same dry humor and bureaucratic reserve by Clark Gregg), who provides a familiar face to bridge series and films. Gregg is excellent as Coulson, playing him again as the rock-solid agent, loyal and intelligent and good at what he does. He is also likable and a bit of a geek, easier to relate to than, say, James Bond (who is essentially a cipher).The series begins with Coulson putting together a team to track down a group calling itself 'The Rising Tide', a group apparently dedicated with tearing down the walls of secrecy that protect the Government and Military, allowing them to undertake covert operations with dangerous, far-reaching implications, without any kind of oversight or accountability; SHIELD is just such an organization. Skye, played by Chloe Bennet, is a member of Rising Tide who ends up becoming a 'consultant' working with the squad (by the end of the season she has earned enough trust to become a full SHIELD agent, but things take a very wrong turn). She stays in contact with the dissident group however, for reasons that end up relating first to a lover, and later on, her parents. Bennet is quite good as one of the two 'entry-points' for viewers, the character who can ask the questions that viewers want to ask -- as the 'rookie' she can seek explanations necessary for herself and the viewer, without looking stupid and feeling unnatural.The other entry-point is Grant Ward, played by Brett Dalton, the first recruit we meet on Coulson's team. As a Black Ops agent he specializes in solo assassinations, and seems to resent joining the team, whose objectives are typically less lethal than he's accustomed to. In the first several episodes his role seems to be an underwhelming one: the super-spy, the deep-undercover operative, the perfectly-honed blade; in other words, an uninteresting James Bond-clone. This, regardless of the fact that the spies of today are usually IQ-150+-female-Ivy League-post-grads-of-vaguely-Middle-Eastern/Asian/North-African descent. But as the series really starts to hit its stride about half-way through, Ward becomes a much more fascinating character. The appearance of his former S.O., played by Bill Paxton (an awesome actor who always brings it - e.g. Aliens, Near Dark, Frailty, A Simple Plan), signals a turning point for the character of Ward and the series as a whole. We learn more about his past and his bond with Garrett (Paxton's character), who served as his mentor. He ends up in an affair with 'The Cavalry', the nickname despised by it's owner, Melinda May. Portrayed by Ming-Na Wen (a former star of the regrettably cancelled Stargate: Universe), she is another reluctant member of the team. She brings with her a secret agenda, one that might indicate loyalty to something other than Coulson and SHIELD. Though she comes closer to the mold of the real American Spy, Ming-Na Wen plays a taciturn soldier and cartwheeling, front-flipping, master-of-all-weapons very convincingly -- her SG:U role was as a pacifistic diplomat who used her communication skills to solve problems borne of misunderstanding; her most pressing goal was to mend the relationship between military and civilian personnel. Trapped aboard an Extragalactic alien spacecraft millions of light years from Earth, she was the voice of understanding and compromise in a rapidly deteriorating situation.While the series started fairly well, I didn't fully engage with the characters and stories until several episodes in, and it's not until we're into the second half of the season that the action and the writing take a step up, feeling like a 'must-watch' program. One advantage to being a network show is that it gets a 22-episode season. This gives the writers plenty of time to flesh out characters and Ideas. While the focus at the beginning is on a group of scientists working on 'the Centipede' a device that activates and amplifies dormant superpowers in the wearer, rest assured that with SHIELD, all roads lead to HYDRA.The stories and dialogue vary in terms of quality, due to the large assortment of writers and producers involved in a show of this size, especially one with a full 22-episode season, as opposed to the 13, 12, 10 and 8-episode blocks that are becoming the standard. The humor falls flat on a fairly regular basis, and some of the back-and-forth between characters made me cringe, but it manages to produce some exciting drama that is at its' best when it remembers not to take itself seriously; as 41-minutes of escapism, it works fine, but a show constructed on a frame for light entertainment can't carry the heavier emotional burdens of Breaking Bad or The Sopranos. Luckily, the showrunners don't often suffer from this identity crisis. While the seasons' second half amps up the drama and the violence, putting characters in real jeopardy and emotionally involving viewers in the betrayals, double-crosses and shocking (or not so shocking) secrets as they are revealed, the creators are smart enough to not give in to the writer-urge to mine such moments for every ounce of gravitas. It's a delicate balance: too little, and the stories and characters become cartoonish (in this case, surprisingly, not a good thing); too much, and it begins to take iself too seriously, resulting in overwrought, overthought, sentimental drivel. The series has a couple scary moments walking this narrative tight-rope, but doesn't fall.There are plenty of plot twists and other interesting surprises (including an early guest spot by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury -- as well as a later one -- another solid connection to the films): a member of the team might be a HYDRA double agent, for example, and an enigmatic alien serum plays a role in a central mystery of the season... but enough of that. It may not be the best show on TV, nor even the best new series; and people hoping for something on the same level as The Avengers need to lower their expectations of network television (and life in general, I suspect). But it it very well done, very entertaining, and it's coming back for another season. Highly recommended, for Marvel fans in particular. When I consider how terrible this show could have been, the end product is surprisingly good. 74/100",1403481600,2014-06-23
5.0,"I loved Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under so I was excited when he chose to do another cable TV show.  This show turned out to be even better than Six Feet Under.  Michael C. Hall plays a serial killer who kills only bad people.  This creates a moral ambiguity that the show plays up nicely.  Is Dexter a good or bad person?  How do we really feel about him?  How does he really feel about himself?  At the time we are exploring the story, Dexter is evolving from a character who states he lacks human feeling to someone who seems to feel more and more with each passing day (or episode).  The show is brilliantly done.  I've read the book and it is a pretty straight forward story.  To build the story up, the writers of the show build up the characters and made them even deeper characters.  I am just so impressed with the work.  They can even make me angry because I'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way.  I am attracted to Dexter and repelled by him at the same time.",1213228800,2008-06-12

4.0,"I must say, i really didnt care for the main antagonist, whom i wont reveal here. Lets just say that there is no way that person defeats a warrior with superior training and experience in single combat. At least, i dont see it truly happening. The person in question repeatedly kicks a bit more ass than you figure could really happen. That part was pure Hollywood.However, the story itself was pretty cool. Essentially, the Ninth Legion gets wiped out and the seven survivors try to first, rescue their general, and then make their way out of enemy territory, which they find themselves pretty deep into. The primary protagonist is a fully honorable soldier, but some of his companions are arguably less so. However, since their survival is tied to one another, they have to get along. The really cool aspect of the story in my opinion is the depiction of them basically jogging/running everywhere. Want to get somewhere in the olden days and you dont have a horse, you gotta run. That really stuck with me as a very good plot device as well as exhibiting quite a bit of realism.You will have recognized a few of the actors elsewhere, but the most recognizable were the boyfriend from the first two seasons of Dr Who, and Dominic West.Anyway, i will refrain from describing too much else about the movie, but it is an overall enjoyable experience.",1310774400,2011-07-16

5.0,"FX serves up this 10-episode ""season"" and with just about as much great story-telling and nail-biting suspense as the film had - or more.  Bob Odenkirk (of Breaking Bad fame ""Saul Goodman"") even plays a role here as a hometown, cake-eating sheriff with his head firmly entrenched in the sand.I saw the movie and loved it, so it didn't take too much convincing for me to try episode 1.  Nor after finishing that episode was there any turning back.  Truth be told, the episode does start off a bit shakily as if the actors are trying to make sure they really are the characters they are portraying.  Martin Freeman, for example, is a Brit who is the playing the lead role of Lester Nygaard.  Freeman is VERY ""British"".  He played ""Tim Canterbury"" in the original BBC version of the series ""The Office"" (which I might add is excellent).  He also played Dr John Watson in the BBCs Sherlock Holmes production ""Sherlock"" (less memorable for me).  How much more British can you get?  In everything I've seen him in there is always something distinctly Brit about him.  How, I wondered, was this going to work in a small town mid-west very ""American"" role like Lester Nygaard.  Could he pull it off?  Could he shed enough of his Brit persona to fit into a character like Lester?  He certainly had the body type for it, small and stringy..  But in the first episode I felt he was still trying to find his feet a little.  As the series goes on though, I felt he did a pretty good job and managed to put in a fairly convincing performance in what must have been a challenging role for him - I don't think he's ever played an American character before. Could be wrong.Of course, Billy Bob Thornton nearly steals the show as the good natured cold-blooded killer Lorne Malvo.  He almost starts off as a somewhat sympathetic character in bothering to help Lester of his ""bullying"" troubles, though later we realize really just what a nasty and bad@ss son of a gun he really is.  He was probably most interesting of the characters, though there were many.  Alison Tolman who plays deptuy Molly Solverson, the only deputy in town with a brain, is also great.  She too develops well into her character, which also must have been a tough role to fill having her character already done to perfection in the original Fargo movie.So, while in episode 1 you can see the seams somewhat, so to speak, by the beginning of episode 2 everything has gelled.  Here we have new characters playing a story we have (partially) seen before.  But wait - - in fact, what I saw here differed so much from what I recall of the movie, I had to wonder if I had even seen Fargo at all!  Of course what you can pack into a 2-hour movie isn't the same as what you pack into a 10-hour series, and for the record there is never a dull moment.  The show is riviting.  The Coen Brothers are in the project somewhere as well (executive producers I think).  Don't hesitate to check this series out - if you liked the movie, even if you didn't - it's a wild ride that'll have you staying up way too late..Incidentally, (SPOILER!)  and in spite of what the captions tell you before each episode - this in NOT a true story.  Hope I didn't disappoint anyone there (just found this out myself), but for some reason the film uses this device.  So go ahead and enjoy those touches of dark humour amidst the slaughter.  You don't have to feel guilty anymore.Series creator Noah Hawley, confirms that if there is a season 2, it will be with new characters and a new story.

3.0,"After loving Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove book series, I was excited to learn a TV program had been developed but so far the translation from print to TV has been a disappointment. Andie MacDowell is great in her role as the &#34;town leader&#34; as the only sitting judge but also a member of a respected and loved family in Cedar Cove. However, besides the casting of Andie MacDowell as Olivia the other actors don't live up to my expectations for the characters. I wish there were more well-known actress and actors instead it is cast of unknowns who don't have any special chemistry together especially the chemistry the viewers who had read the book series  would expect the who people who live, work and raise their families in the small community of Cedar Cove.  As a Hallmark Channel production, I guess they didn't have the budget for better know actors and it is a real shame because there is so much potential with the material from the Cedar Cove book series. It reminds a bit of  the eccentric town in Gilmore Girls without the chemistry the actors had with each other on Gilmore Girls. As I think of it, many of the Gilmore Girl cast members would be perfect for the Cedar Cove residences. Lauren Graham would have been a great in the role played by Andie MacDowell, an actor like Rob Estes (Melrose Place and The Women's Murder Club) would be great as Jack, Olivia's love interest.

A 6 hour flight turned into a 21 hour flight, but we got lucky and everyone survived the 'awaiting crash' from icy-weather and faulty mechanics. The devastation of waiting for a plane to crash is something one could never forget. I cannot imagine the Fear of watching the plane go down, not knowing if anyone will survive. In this movie, the plane did go down and the passengers aboard were not so lucky. This is a New Year's Eve to remember as the passengers aboard this flight first discover malfunction through horrifying turbulence, then witness the plane crashing. The crash itself was a Nightmare, but only the Beginning for those who survived as they find themselves running for their lives.

4.0,"Let me state upfront that I had never head of the so-called Toynbee Tiles mystery before. I saw a trailer for this documentary when watching another movie recently, and my interest was peaked, so I sought out this DVD.""Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles"" (2011 release; 87 min.) attempts to get final answers to two questions: (i) who is responsible for the hundreds of tiles that started appearing in the mid-80s in various  East coast and Midwest cities in the US, and eventually also in several South American cities; and (ii) what is the real meaning of what is written in those tiles? The documentary primarily follows Justin Duerr, a Philadelphia native who started obsessing over this years ago. He eventually is joined by a couple of other guys who are equally intrigued by this mystery. I am not going to say anything more about how things unfold, you'll just have to see it for yourself.Several comments: not knowing anything about the subject matter, I thought that the initial  5 or 10 minutes of the movie laid out the mystery very nicely. I also thought to myself, ""how are they going to stretch this into a full-blown movie"", but as it turned out, that was not a problem at all. In fact, this documentary had no trouble keeping my interest for the entire hour and a half. Kudos to director/producer/composer/editor/photographer Jon Foy. Made on a shoe-string budget, this movie clearly is a labor of love. As an aside, I was very impressed with/charmed by Foy's original movie soundtrack, which I absolutely loved. In all, ""Resurrect Dead"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1348444800,2012-09-24

5.0,"I was hesitant about this show. I am not sure why, but I put off trying it for a long time. Then I heard some interviews with Carrie Brownstein and she seemed like an interesting and intelligent person so I decided to watch the first season. I liked it, but I was not blown away. At some point in the second season that changed. I laughed as hard as I have ever laughed in my entire life at some of the sketches in this second season. I was actually in physical pain from laughing at some of the sketches. That is when I knew I was a convert.The writing on the show is excellent and very consistent. Obviously, some sketches are funnier than others, but the percentage of really funny sketches on this show is, I think, higher than any other sketch show I have ever watched. I have also come to really love the recurring characters. I think that is part of the reason I liked the second season better than the first. It took a little while for some of the characters to grow on me, and I think it took me a little while to really figure out the sensibility of the show, but now that I have figured out the sensibility, and gotten to know the characters, it has really become one of my favorite shows.Fred and Carrie are also really good comic actors. That is probably no surprise with Fred since he has been a staple cast member on Saturday Night Live for ten years, but it is amazing to me what a great comic actor Carrie is. She delivers her lines perfectly. Some of the humor in this show can be subtle. Some of it is not subtle at all. But a lot of it is the kind of comedy that would not necessarily crack you up on the page, but delivered correctly it is genius, and Fred and Carrie always deliver it beautifully.The whole show just has a really great feel. Every sketch feels like the kind of thing that you come up with when you are sitting around with your friends and someone says something funny, or introduces some funny premise, and then someone else takes it further, and someone else takes it further, and so on, until everyone is laughing so hard they can barely stand it. Watching this show is like that. The show really feels like it is just friends having fun and it seems, from the interviews I have seen with Fred and Carrie, like that is an accurate account of how this show came into being. I think that whole sensibility carries over into the show and makes it a really enjoyable viewing experience.There is one sketch from this season that I have to single out. It was the sketch where a bunch of kids are at a museum and Fred and Carrie are playing Lewis and Clark. I don't know what it was about that sketch. It is a really weird sketch in some ways, but I am not exaggerating when I say that I laughed harder at that sketch than I have ever laughed at anything in my life (""I don't know why you're running!...They are still running..."") Any show that can take such a weird, silly, premise, and make me laugh that hard, deserves my absolute seal of approval. If you have been hesitant about this show, as I was, I recommend giving it a try as soon as possible.",1362096000,2013-03-01

He sets out looking for his brother Hakan who everyone thinks can restore order. Along the way Steinar begins to change and becomes the man his father was hoping for. I have never really been a big fan of the 300 type movies. I'm not sure why but the whole mid-evil genre just doesn't do it for me. That said, this movie wasn't really that bad and is worth seeing but when there is no action going on the movie really begins to slow down and I start to lose interest. There is enough action to keep you watching though, but the movie really starts to feel flat about a half hour in and never really picks itself back up. Fans of this genre may like this but I thought it was just a little too slow to stay fully interested in. Overall, another 300 rip off that feels flat. I give it a C+.",1373500800,2013-07-11

3.0,"For the most part, I enjoyed the first season of Lie to Me. Tim Roth is a fine actor, and very well cast as the protagonist, Dr. Lightman. He lends depth and intensity to a script that sometimes veers into the dangerous waters of daytime drama. The plots are uniformly interesting, and nicely paced.  The filming was crisp, and the directing was tight, which made up for the woeful mediocrity of the rest of the cast. (The one notable exception to an otherwise bland supporting cast being Mekhi Phifer who plays Agent Ben Reynolds.  But, you have to wait until the end of the first season for this much needed spice.)The real problem with Lie to Me is that, unlike Bones, there is very little science in the science. (And now I am going to speak as someone who has spent countless hours of doctoral research on cross-cultural nonverbal communication.) While the main ideas behind the psycholinguistics of deception are correct, some of the ""data"" presented in this show are completely misleading.  Somehow the writers, whether in their ignorance of the subtleties of the field, or in the interest of presenting something palatable to a general TV audience, have missed the basic point of psycholinguistics, which is that nonverbal and paralinguistic modes of communication are shared by all members of a given society.  In other words, we are all ""naturals."" Reading subtle facial cues (""body language"") is a vital part of what keeps society going. In fact, individuals who cannot read these subtle cues are diagnosable as autistic. (Asberger's Syndrome is a form of autism in which the individual cannot read nonverbal emotional cues.) So, there really isn't any magic in reading nonverbal cues.The other side of that coin is that we cannot correctly interpret nonverbal cues if we are not members of that society.  While it is true that there are some universal expressions (fear, surprise), the vast majority of facial cues are culture specific. Lying falls into that category. If a Mayan Indian smiles, nods and says ""yes"" after being told the world will end in 2012, he or she is NOT agreeing with you, but he or she is also not lying. (Nodding, smiling and saying ""yes"" are merely signs of politeness. If you asked that same person if he or she had murdered someone after breakfast that morning, you would receive exactly the same response.) The only thing a psycholinguist can accurately judge is whether a person from a given society is displaying discomfort or anxiety.  The cause of that discomfort is unknown, of course, and does not mean that the person is lying. (Which is why polygraphs are so notoriously unreliable. Telling the truth can make a person even more uncomfortable than lying.) In that light, I found the constant refrain of ""You're lying!"" to be not only irritating, but highly inaccurate. (There are also quite a few factual errors which not only reveal a profound ignorance of the legal system on the part of the writers, but an unwillingness to do simple research, both of which are inexcusable in the age of the internet.)In spite of the reservations I have about this show, I still found it fun to watch Tim Roth, if not much else.",1309996800,2011-07-07

4.0,"I would give this movie 5 stars, but I felt there was something missing. The feel of the old Star Trek, the honest human element of reason. All of which Gene Roddenbury gave us in his Star Trek. I know those were low or no budget and they had to fill the show with something, so they went the cheap way. But, that was an element of hope and clarity for the future or humankind.  I have watched Star Trek since I was a young child, I met Deforest Kelly, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, George Taki, and James Doohan at various conventions when I was younger. Sometimes more than once. My point is, I was addicted to the show and the shows that came after. All four series were excellent in their own right. This movie while it is lacking that something, is excellent too, in it's own right. All right, I hear the ""Boo's"" already, and you probably think I am either on crack or nuts. I get it. Well, the nut's is debatable, but, I assure you I am quite sober. I read some of the reviews, and I feel that the reviewers missed something. We are no longer in the 60's, the 80's, the 90's etc. And there is something that Star Trek has always been, a reflection of the current political, social, and overall mindset of the time period. True there has always been a message that Gene Roddenberry has given us. That message is lacking here. Going into this movie expecting to see the Gene Roddenberry Star Trek is like expecting ""Enterprise"" to be a remake of the original Star Trek. It just isn't so. I loved this movie as a movie that took place in the Star Trek universe. Was it perfect, NO! But, it certainly had merit. And, I remind you, that we had not seen anything new ""Star Trek"" related in years prior to this movie. So, those of you who did not like the movie, I understand. Perhaps if you gave it a chance based solely on the fact that it does take place in the Star Trek universe, you might enjoy it. Those of you who see the merit in this movie lets hope they keep making these movies so that maybe we will get a Star Trek TV series out of the franchise.Ralph J. Fitcher.",1367884800,2013-05-07
3.0,"Although I do enjoy history, anthropology and scientific studies, I found the film about an hour too long. You could have explained historical, physical and nutritional evolution really well without going into 15 minutes of how the bones are dissolved in HCL and then made into flakes to study the diet of historical humans. You could have driven that point home with a sentence or two. That is just one example of way over-selling your philosophy of nutrition. The football field/human evolution timeline analogy was incredibly drawn-out. I really feel the general public could benefit the most from the last 40 minutes. Unless you really want to hear long interviews and monologues, skip to the part where the doctor/dietitian and narrator/director go to the grocery store. This was the most useful information (as far as real-world application for the general public) of the whole documentary.",1382918400,2013-10-28
5.0,"I think that when the writers introduced the character ""Michonne"" to the cast of the Walking Dead it did SO much to create and renergize this show.  Every time I see her in action, chopping off heads of the dead with that kick-butt sword and basically creating a this one woman army against the army of the dead... I just get such a kick out of her personality and character performance.Michonne reminds me so much of Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill,"" which is one of my most favorite kung fu flicks, when I watch her in action.  I have a feeling MANY of you out there that love this show really dig her too.  You cannot but love this quite yet physical woman.  She is Xena, Black Mamba (Kiddo), and Wonder Woman all in one.SPOILER:  I just got through watching ""HOME"" and I was thinking to myself of how the action was getting a bit slow, but then the writers blow me away again with the attack on the prison and I find myself once again gripped by the drama and action pack fighting and the brutal struggle against not only the dead but the wretchedness of Woodbury's governor!Can't wait until next episode, I have a feeling its time for revenge against the Governor's well armed town.  And just between us, I think Michonne is very, VERY fond of Andrea and would not be at all surprised to find out she confesses her feelings for her later in the season. Could be wrong though?Keep the drama coming AMC and well done with casting Michonne!  =)Thanks for reading my review.",1361232000,2013-02-19

5.0,"So, okay, I love the concept and execution of the set. It's a simple set with a single Blu-Ray format case housing first the Blu discs, then the DVDs, and coming with a single UV redemption code for the whole season in high def.It comes with a couple bonus features on both the Blu / DVD discs (last disc, I think?)...Overall, I like the execution. I think this is how things should generally be released going forward. Kudos on that, WB! Blu for high def, DVD for low-def or for sharing with friends who haven't yet upgraded and UV for online streaming or downloadable personal digital copy. Kind of like future-proofing. Makes sense to me.However, I'll note that, for whatever reason, the 'high def' video quality doesn't seem all that great. Especially watching on UV via VUDU (haven't tried yet via CinemaNow to see if the same problems persist via a different UV ecosystem provider). It's especially apparent on the pilot episode, but seems endemic. While it's high def there seem to be lots of compression artifacts abounding making he picture look pretty poor quality, especially noticeable on my 60"" TV when you get right up close. It looks pretty bad...So, I put in the Blu-Ray just to compare. It looks *a bit better* on Blu-Ray proper, but there's still quite a bit of graininess. So, I'm a bit disappointed. I don't know if it's 'cause the original was shot at lower def and upgraded, or whether the transfer just wasn't done cleanly from film or whatever.I haven't yet looked closely at season 2 Blu's yet to see if the problems persist with the transfer. I'll take a look more closely at some point and find out.Overall, though, I love the set and the show itself. And since one sits the better part of 8-10 feet away from the screen the artifacts aren't terribly noticeable at that distance. Right up close it's VERY noticeable, especially streaming, probably due to compression algorithms being somewhat 'lossy?' But I can forgive it sin ethe overall set is great.Can't wait for Seasons 3-4 to update to the Blu+DVD+UV format, since it looks like they were originally released in Blu-only format (no DVD or UV). Once you ship 'em that way (combo pack), I'll pick 'em up, very few questions asked. As long as they're done as well as these are. I'm all for it! And the combo-ness is a good thing, sinec my friend who loves the show hasn't yet upgraded to a Blu-ray player and he LOVES the show too, so with the combo pack, we can still enjoy them over at his place and laugh our butts off for hours on end.

3.0,"I watch this series for its action and fantasy/scifi aspects.  This episode is loaded down with interpersonal drama, hand-wringing and an especially touchy-feely sex scene. In fact, there's a lot of touchy-feely, chick flick stuff in it. If that's your cup of tea, fine.  And some such is more or less expected in this day and age.  However, this episode is way too full of it. Given my personal preferences, if it were not for a very intriguing alpha related plot element, I would have given this episode 2 stars and I would be feeling a lot of concern about the future direction of the show.",1349395200,2012-10-05
4.0,"Rebecca is happy to reunite with her friends as she returns to school, after the death of her father. Her best friend in this boarding school for young girls is Lucy, until Ernessa enters the picture and destroys the friendship. Rebecca takes it to heart, but then develops a crush on her English teacher as she immerses herself in a Gothic Vampire novel, while becoming convinced that Ernessa is a Vampire, and the drama becomes intense. Rebecca decides to get rid of Ernessa with feelings of mixed-emotions. The drama turns into horror as the bodies of young girls begin to multiply with danger in the air. The haunting story is creepy, chilling, and filled with anxiety. Passion turns into fear with heart-pounding suspense. Highly Recommended for Horror lovers!",1345248000,2012-08-18

5.0,"We love this show!  The acting is incredible and the storyline is very believable.  There are characters you love to hate (like Tiffy) and then there are characters you adore, and others who surprise you in varying episodes.  Scott Foley is so good - you never know what to think about him - whether he's sometimes careless or otherwise brilliant and shows his &#34;human&#34; side.  He is also very good at dropping in bouts of humor when they are very much needed.  I highly recommend this show!",1405123200,2014-07-12
5.0,Freda was a pleasant surprise. I thought a knew all about the Beatles. I guess not. Most of the movie was during their early years with their manager Eppy. I also learned a lot about Liverpool and the cavern during their early years. This movie was worth watching.,1387497600,2013-12-20
4.0,"This film is slow but it is meant to be because it is an elegy to the loss of the senses, one by one.  Two beautiful people fall in love when this begins worldwide,  The order of loss is smell, taste, hearing, vision.  The beautiful thing this film does is that as each sense is loss there is a renewed but brief celebration of the sense or senses left. The world is also ending.  There is no reason discernible for any of this,This is one of many end of the world films or books which have come forth in the some number in the last few years,  There seems to be almost no interest in depicting us being overtaken by aliens and sent to oblivion by them. No, this is the end of our world on earth as given by each writer's take on now it will occur,  Although the woman is a doctor working in illness outbreak, she is unable to prove that this is any dissease.Another clever aspect is that each loss is preceded by some wild emotional outburst.  The smell one is preceded by fits of sobbing.  The hearing one starts with a fit of rage.  I found it fascinating that an avalanche of emotion heralded each loss.This film grows on you,  The first twenty minutes passes very, very slowly but if you stick with it, you will find yourself pulled into it.As an added benefit, Ewan McGregor and Eva Green in the lead roles, have to be two of the most gorgeous people on the planet.  Louis CK recently did a comedy act where he said that he'd been a heterosexual all of his forty plus years.  However, he recently met Ewan MacGregor and found himself just mesmerized by how beautiful he was.  Finally he concluded that even he could turn gay briefly if it meant he could have Ewan!I think the movie is great if you can hang in there through the very slow start.",1355529600,2012-12-15
3.0,"TV shows always seem to be an all or nothing proposition in Amazon reviews. If someone watches a show, they automatically feel that it is five star quality despite its limitations. If someone tries a show and doesn't like it, they generally relegate it to a one star status despite its good points. Don't believe it? Go to the reviews of any program you absolutely hate and look at the glowing five star reviews from its fans. In truth, most shows fall somewhere in between--not every show you watch should automatically be considered as great entertainment and not every show you dislike merits a dismissive one star. I bring this up with NBC's short lived ""The Cape"" for one reason--I have only heard the show described as terrific or as terrible with very little middle ground. Personally, I think the show is neither terrific nor terrible but falls into the TV netherworld of a show with potential that never really fulfilled its promise.Capitalizing on the notion that every story with comic book origins deserves a Hollywood treatment (in itself, a specious idea), ""The Cape"" was introduced to capture the audience left when the increasingly problematic ""Heroes"" left the air. But lacking that show's complex mythology and appealing cast, it was an uphill battle from the start. I do contend that the elements to have developed a successful show were all present, they were just never assembled in the right way.The Good: David Lyons was a likable lead--a family man and cop who is forced into a heroic alter ego when framed (and seemingly murdered) by the town's super villain. James Frain has a nice menace as the unstable foe. Morally corrupt Keith David and a bevy of carnival performers provide unlikely support to our new hero. And sci-fi stalwart Summer Glau is on hand as the altruistic, and completely underdeveloped, Orwell. And best of all--Vinnie Jones!The Bad: The show never loses interest in Lyons' wife and child. And, I'm sorry, they just aren't compelling characters. The show's momentum grinds to an absolute halt every time they appear. Excruciating.The Frustrating: I don't think the show ever determined what it wanted to do and is tonally all over the place. Veering from maudlin to comedic from one moment to the next does little to shore up the inconsistencies in the show. Frain, Glau, and David all have great potential--but none are given fully developed plot lines. There is simultaneously too much going on and not enough--there needed to be more focus on the elements that worked. There needed to be more emphasis on the bigger good versus evil concept as opposed to lesser stand alone episodes.With so many choices in this overcrowded genre, I don't know that ""The Cape"" rates particularly highly. But it is far from unwatchable and its cast is game. A show I wanted to like more than I did, it still boasts nice production values and a laugh or two--but never gelled to one cohesive vision.

4.0,"The first season of american horror story is truly a horror classic. It was about the theme of a haunted evil house and it did better than most people ever did. This one is serveral genres all mixed together. and everyone of these are genres in other horror shows: 'it's got mad nazi scientists creating monsters, it's got evil nuns, it's got satan possessing people, it's got a brutal  asylum,  a serial killer, aliens who kidnap people, maniac christmas killers who dress like santa!. Every one of those was featured in some horror movie seperately. This means that this one just goes flying into all of these ideas at once. It's not near as good as the classic first season but it's still very wild horror tv! You have some really great actors in this one too. Jessica lange is of course great in this , as you would expect. But everyone else does  a fine job too. Still it's got so many types of genres in this , that I am not surprised that some people will hate this. I hope that next season , they don't try to have so many horror elements in one show! although it was interesting as a expirement to see this mish mash of genres! Oh yeah , I left out the deranged man who picks up the hitchiker plotline. )one episode).  this one is not for the squemish and it should offend you. This one has to be the most deranged tv show ever broadcast on american tv. So far. It's still good though and may become legendary in that regard even if they come up with something more deranged this one is still the one that melded so many horror genres together and somehow pulled it off. And it did it first.",1358985600,2013-01-24

I have not really thought about the behind-the-scenes lives of aspiring classical musicians, but the concept is perfect for a drama series.The characters are very likable, from the main character (Haley) to the no-nonsense character played by Saffron Burrows. The production quality looks top notch and I think there will be some great drama and lovely music.If you are a fan of shows such as Treme, and enjoyed movies such as Black Swan, I think you will like this.",1391731200,2014-02-07

4.0,"I was skeptical because I heard reviews about the Xbox 360 game of the same name from a friend who is a manager at Gamestop.  I found out that the reality is the show is not only entertaining, but for a &#34;made for TV&#34; science fiction story, the world of Defiance is quite entertaining and engaging.  The alternate story line is believable and while there are some parts of several of the episodes toward the end of the season that &#34;jump&#34; forward (you have to take the mental leap of faith with the story line) you still get a sense that the writers are writing as they go...but that it is positive.  Overall, there are some &#34;magical&#34; elements to the post-aliens-arrive-on-earth universe with several different alien races now living here on earth.  Interestingly, this alternate future doesn't seem to have one race be overly powerful (they are mainly all equal) but there is a lot of back story being filled in and a lot of future technology that may impact each of the &#34;now earth&#34; races if they get their hands of said technologies.  There are also some good spiritual and moral implementations exuded in this series, such as loyalty, sacrifice, and honor.  I would not recommend this show for children under the age of 17 personally, but I'm a relatively conservative parent also that doesn't believe in exposing my children to a lot of concepts and social issues prematurely (before concrete operations or abstract thinking have developed.)  Hope this helps someone and hope you enjoy it like I did!",1402358400,2014-06-10

3.0,"Although it remains rather thin, the plot thickens during episode 6 by way of a flashback to Ingrid's sordid past and a glimpse of things to come when another character's true identity is revealed to the viewer. The pilot didn't leave me with a burning desire to keep watching, but I'm glad I did. While the show has much room for improvement, there are definite strengths here, most notably the cast (with one exception). The choice of Julia Ormond as Joanna Beauchamp is only slightly bested by the pick of M&auml;dchen Amick as the black cat of the family, Wendy Beauchamp. As for the daughters: Rachel Boston is convincing as Ingrid Beauchamp, but Jenna Dewan, despite being absolutely radiant on-screen, does not to me seem like a good fit for the show as Freya Beauchamp.The magick should be compelling by today's television standards, and indeed sometimes it is; other times, however, it more resembles parlour tricks, and occasionally is reminiscent of Bewitched from 1964. I'm still trying to figure out who the target demographic is for Witches of East End. It's brimming with soapy drama to potentially draw in the crowd who normally wouldn't watch a show in this genre, but it also maintains just enough of a morbid edge for viewers like me. In this sense, it is no better or worse than a serial like The Vampire Diaries.UPDATE &lt;Dec.2013> SEASON FINALE ... The final episode of the premier season goes about it the right way: ending a major plot line while at the same time providing a premonition of things to come. It remains a 3-star show; proficient enough to keep you coming back, but falling well short of providing episodes that blow you away. The introduction of Joel Gretsch as WitchDaddy (my term, not theirs) late in the season was a wise choice, as the actor brings credibility and potentially some fans (The 4400: The Complete Series). I'd like him to continue as a recurring character, and I'd like to see production of more than just the next season of WoEE (a second season of 13 episodes has been confirmed by Lifetime).",1384300800,2013-11-13

5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Europa Report, but I didn't expect it to be my favorite movie of 2013. Yet, this is easily the best movie I've seen all year.The story is about a human expedition to the Jovian moon Europa to search for signs of life. However, quickly into the mission, things start going wrong. The crew manages to reach Europa, but loses communications with Earth and finds something they didn't expect. While I wouldn't describe this as a horror/thriller movie, it certainly has those elements.Europa Report is told through pseudo-documentary footage. Sebasti&aacute;n Cordero utilizes the camera well. He captures the story from unique angles, which makes the movie much more interesting to watch than a standard documentary would be. Even more impressive is his use of silence or still camera frames. In space, there's nothing scarier than several seconds of a silent black screen.The characters are generally low-key but Cordero found very subtle but effective ways to give each a unique personality. Very quickly, I found myself actually caring about the characters. The acting is generally quite solid and the characters come across believably as scientists and engineers. Unlike say Prometheus, Europa Report manages to remember that its characters are scientists and that they are reasonable intelligent individuals. There are no horror movie tropes here. No idiots petting alien lifeforms and no contrived teenage romances between the crew members. These characters are professionals.Best of all, this movie never forgets the &#34;science&#34; in &#34;science fiction.&#34; While I can't pretend that everything depicted is scientifically accurate, the movie does at least respect science as more than just a backdrop for the story. There are aliens and spaceships, but more importantly there is the thrill of scientific discovery. The characters are motivated by their desire to learn more about the universe. The movie then raises the question of how far humans - and humanity as a whole - will go in the pursuit of knowledge. When the movie ended I actually found myself wondering how I would react if the Europa Report were real news footage.Overall, if you enjoy science fiction, Europa Report is definitely worth checking out. A pleasant surprise. Overall: 5 stars.",1385769600,2013-11-30

3.0,"'The First 48' offers an interesting view of psychological profiling. The emphasis is not on sensationalism but the efforts to find the offenders. Included are personal aspects of both the victims and perpetrators.  This is the second of the two seasons offered on Amazon Prime. Since this is a TV series, there is repetition (noted in another review) that allows time for commercials. Note that this is an A&E; Network production and is a better quality than other productions in this genre.  Most episodes involve two different criminal investigations and others address a single incident. The episodes take place in different cities and feature homicide detectives from that area. Emotions run the gamut from tragic to humorous. The narrator gives a description and an explanation that is easy to follow. If you like this genre, the portrayal and cases are well presented. The name is derived from that 48 hour window after an investigation begins. Each episode ends with this quote: "". . . presumed innocent until proven guilty."" The 'presumed' means not 'proven' or not 'solved.' There are not always 'complete answers.' If you want 'absolutes,' this series will be disappointing.One might wonder at the seemingly endless availability and types of firearms used. Knives and other means of murder?

But they are great on Amazon Prime.",1392422400,2014-02-15
4.0,I felt the series was excellent in that it took the &#34;romance&#34; out of the life of the rich and titled in England.  The ruling class cared little for the people who made their lives so comfortable and pampered.  The lack of time off for rest and to see their families was bordering on cruelty toward those who could not fight back.,1392249600,2014-02-13
5.0,I loved the angle of where history meets crime and being able to learn from previous cases to solve what is currently happening!,1386201600,2013-12-05
4.0,"This was my first test movie, and it was more enjoyable than I thought it would be, given some of the other reviews of test movies I've seen.  I guess you just need to realize that this isn't a completed, polished movie.The animation and voice work was better than I thought it would be.  The premise of the story was interesting, and although I think a few areas of the script could use some work, I'd rate this as a positive experience.  It was loads better and more interesting than a lot of the movies shown on places like SyFy.  The ""love story"" needs a little more development, as does Blue's initial choice regarding Tyler. I was left scratching my head at that particular point in the script.  The typical Hollywood shortcuts were taken for the ""romance"", which I don't think presented Blue well.  It came across as more of ""I'll love whoever can touch me without giving me pain"", than about Tyler.  The ""twist"" wasn't very surprising to me, but I thought it was well played within the script, and actually made sense.  The ending leaves things open for a sequel, but also makes sense, given the hope presented to all Screamers during the final act.All in all, I'll be watching and reviewing other test movies.  Good job to all involved, and good luck with your project!",1328918400,2012-02-11
4.0,This has become one of my favorite tv series. The people in this town never seem to really work and there are all these town events that everyone is involved in.  Its funny and a great escape after a hard day at work.  I can hardly wait until next season comes out.,1371945600,2013-06-23

3.0,"You know how there's ""Chick Flicks?""  Well, I would consider this movie a ""D**k Flick.""  Not wild and manic as some however, and pretty thoughtful social commentary. Really funny moments, and some very irreverent ones regarding race and mental disabilities.  I fell in love with Ben Schwartz. He's freakin' hilarious, and has an odd but cute way about it. Whenever he was on screen the movie automatically got better.  Want some light entertainment? This is it.",1379203200,2013-09-15

4.0,"I really enjoyed every episode of this series.  The characters are interestingly developed,  and  very well portrayed.  The cast consisted of talented and congenial actors, most of whom were new to me, but most pleasing. They all portrayed realistic characters. One cannot say that of many crime series these days.  I enjoyed this series as much as, maybe more than,  another of Mr. Campbell's creations of several years.  I still remember Bruce Willis and Sybil Shepherd in &#34;Moonlighting.&#34;  It, too was unique, and very entertaining.The plots in The Glades revealed crime processing procedure in orderly, intelligent manner.  The ongoing challenges of the characters in their respective family situations made the story flow to hold interest of the viewer, without extreme violence or shockingly graphic scenes. I really appreciate that.  This feature made the series unique and exceptional in my opinion.After saying all this, I was shocked and dismayed after viewing the final episode of Season 4 to learn that A & E. Network had suddenly canceled the series.  That is such a disappointment.  Seems to me when a project achieves a large and  enthusiastic audience, the network would realize a valid reason to continue the story.  What a let down for all the fans of &#34;The Glades&#34; to suddenly cancel just as the beloved characters were bout to realize a special time in their lives. In addition, the plot left so many unanswered questions about possibilities of future challenges in lives of the characters.  I felt really cheated by the cancellation in such a manner.  It shows very little regard for the fans who loved the series.I have hopes that this series will be resumed in production someday, and soon.  I cannot understand how something as pleasant as this can be shoved aside while we are still subjected to such things as Duck Dynasty, The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad. This does not speak well for the state of our civilization and the taste of most watchers of TV.  In my opinion...",1404518400,2014-07-05

4.0,"OVERVIEW:  The premise of ""South Park"" was conceived by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker in the early 1990s.  Due to its viral-video success, Comedy Central picked up the rights to the franchise and aired the first episode of the adult animated series in 1997.  The cartoon garnered fame as one of the first shows to hinge its comedy on the use of crude language, satirical storylines, and dark humor.  Set in South Park, Colorado, the main characters of the show--Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick--often parody the childhoods of their writers.SPECIAL FEATURES of the Season 15 box-set include deleted scenes, ""6 Days to Air:  The Making of `South Park,'"" ""6 Days to Air:  Behind the Scenes of `City Sushi,'"" and ""Commentary-Mini.""  If you have never watched the episodes with ""Commentary Mini,"" I encourage you to do so; the short commentaries from Trey Parker and Matt Stone are optionally run during the first three minutes of each episode.  Parker and Stone have used this method of commentary since the early seasons.  Their short introductions often expose insights behind particular jokes, further multiplying the laugh count.SEASON 15 kicked off in the spring of 2011 with fourteen episodes, each written during the week before broadcast.  In true ""South Park"" style, some of the pop-culture references of this season include:  The Royal Wedding, the History Channel, ""The Matrix,"" U.S./Mexico Border Security, DeVry University, Wiki-Leaks, Steve Jobs/Apple, Asperger's Syndrome, Broadway Theater, ""The Human Centipede,"" Comedy Central's First Annual Comedy Awards, the NCAA, Veganism, and the War on Wall Street.  I have been a fan of ""South Park"" since its beginning and religiously purchase each season; however, I feel that the show's wit and charm has been in a slump since season 14.  While I still find the show highly entertaining, much of the recent comedy has felt `forced.'  I am happy to say that the writing seems to pick back up in Season 16 and is nearly fully-operational by Season 17.EPISODES:  In the middle of the 15th Season, the episode ""You're Getting Old"" gave the implication to many viewers that Stone and Parker may have used the plot as an allegory for expressing their feelings about the direction of the ""South Park"" series.  Because the later seasons failed to impress long-time viewers, the fear of an impending end to ""South Park"" only gained steam.  By the end of Season 15, Comedy Central had announced an extension to Stone and Parker's contract which promises to carry the series into 2016 (Season 20), thus subsiding the worry of dedicated fans.Episode 1:  ""HUMANCENTiPAD""--When Cartman doesn't get the iPad he has been bragging about, he starts a campaign against his mother; Kyle fails to iTunes updates before agreeing to them.Episode 2:  ""Funnybot""--Jimmy names the Germans as the world's least funny people during the school Comedy Awards; Germany retaliates by producing a funny robot.Episode 3:  ""Royal Pudding""--Canadians around the world tune in to watch the royal marriage, as is tradition.  But when the new princess is kidnapped, Canada is left in a state of chaos... as is tradition.Episode 4:  ""T.M.I.""--When the school posts the students' height differentials, Cartman misinterprets the `objects' measured.Episode 5:  ""Crack Baby Athletic Association""--Cartman exploits the entertainment quality of crack-babies, creating a lucrative business venture the Kyle cannot resist.Episode 6:  ""City Sushi""--Big-Rig Butters, Inspector Butters, Marjorine, Professor Chaos, and Leopold Stotch are discovered to have a single unifying quality:  Butters.  To avoid being grounded, Butters must sort out his multiple personality disorder.Episode 7:  ""You're Getting Old""--Stan becomes more cynical with age leading to a breakup with Kyle.  Sharon and Randy separate so Randy can pursue his dreams as `Steamy Ray Vaughn.'Episode 8:  ""Azz Burgers""--Due to an onset of antisocial behavior, Stan is believed to have Asperger's Syndrome.  With Kyle's help, Cartman opens a business called Cartman Burger.Episode 9:  ""The Last of the Meheecans""--In an elaborate came of capture-the-flag, Butters becomes trapped in Mexico and earns the alias `Mantequilla.'  Cartman joins the U.S. Border Patrol to prevent Butters from crossing back over as well as to seal his win.Episode 10:  ""Bass to Mouth""--A gossip website exposes the private e-mails and phone conversations of South Park students; the boys orchestrate a plan to bring the hacker to justice.Episode 11:  ""Broadway Bro Down""--[Episode co-written by Robert Lopez]  Randy becomes a Broadway enthusiast after discovering theater's subconscious effect on Sharon.Episode 12:  ""1%""--Cartman's scores on the Presidential Fitness Test destroy the entire school's average.Episode 13:  ""A History Channel Thanksgiving""--The boys stumble on a conspiracy theory concerning aliens, ghosts, and the first Thanksgiving.Episode 14:  ""The Poor Kid""--When Kenny and his siblings are shuffled into foster care, Cartman becomes the poorest kid in class.",1382832000,2013-10-27

I like the story, the clothes, and how she maneuvers around the courtroom. Its nice to see a woman rise above when the odds are stacked against her. I am giving 4 stars cause the acting is not that great, especially her roommate's acting.",1396569600,2014-04-04

3.0,"I had a lot of trouble just making out the dialogue either because of the audio quality, the particular British accents the actors adopted, and/or my own aging ears, but on the other hand, what's going on is pretty self-evident.  Two former military buddies get together to collaborate on working as professional hitmen because they need the money and one of them has to live down a botched job in Kiev.  He brutally kills a number of allegedly bad people as if to make up for his previous slip-up, until the two of them run into a bit of a pickle in the end (to say the least).  In between all the blood and guts spilled, the men act like normal if a bit neurotic blokes, one of them with an unbelievably loyal wife and kid and the other with an attractive but mysterious girlfriend with an apparent penchant for witchery of the black kind.It's not the kind of film that I normally watch because of the gore and violence level, but it features excellent acting, very effective background music, and sickeningly realistic special effects.  It's kind of like a Quentin Tarantino film on steroids. I wouldn't recommend it except to those with a strong stomach, so I'm only giving it three stars.",1392595200,2014-02-17

1.0,This in no way is a horror movie.  I finally got a chance to watch it for free and it stunk worse than a dead road kill on a hot New Mexico day.  Best advice is to stay away from this movie unless you want to watch a man handcuffed for days and when he's released by his best friend he forgives him as if it never took place. I would have been pissed and started kicking some backside. I'm awarding this movie the worst D- rated movie of 2013.,1393718400,2014-03-02

The three-way relationship between Jenna Fischer, Chris Messina, and Messina's Mechanical Man (a new twist on a love triangle, no? Well, no, not really a love triangle but... well you'll see) is nicely developed and has a good story to tell.3 stars instead of 4 or more because the start was soooo slow.

4.0,"I can't begin to tell you how much I detest a majority of the ""found footage"" films. Every time I see a new released, my eyes roll into the back of my head and I sigh heavily. The only reason I picked up ""The Bay"" when I saw it was the box and tagline caught my attention. If it wasn't for Director Barry Levinson's name attached to it, I would have put it back. After watching it, I'd say it's definitely one of the better films using the shtick.In 2009, the town of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland discovers its water is infected. The mayor refuses to admit the seriousness of the situation even as people begin turning up dead and sick. After several more victims die in public, the town goes into a state of fear and closes down. Several eyewitnesses capture the entire incident on camera and cell phones.I still can't believe a renowned director like Barry Levinson would helm a ""found footage"" movie. The entire concept just seems so below him. It's fairly obvious ""The Bay"" was a pet project for Levinson. He's credited as a co-producer and co-writer of the film. Regardless, he accomplished what he set out to do through adequate pacing and some great stomach-churning scenes, which quite possibly could have some individuals scrambling for a barf bag.The visual effects for ""The Bay"" are impressive. They might be doctored a little with CGI, but for the most part they look practical. I don't know what they used for the nasty little creatures, but I was convinced they were real. That's how you know you're seeing a good movie. You're pulled into it and are never distracted by bad special effects or acting.I have to admit that I laughed while watching the credits as they rolled. I saw Oren Peli's name as one of the producers for ""The Bay"" and said to myself, ""Of course."" I've got to hand it to this guy. He's taken an old gimmick and struck gold with it over and over again.""The Bay"" includes a couple special features. There's audio commentary with Director Barry Levinson. We also get a featurette entitled ""Into the Unknown: Barry Levinson on 'The Bay.'""I can't deny ""The Bay"" is worth a watch. The concept of the film is very believable. That's what makes it so frightening. You come away from it with this nagging suspicion that what you just saw quite easily could happen.",1366761600,2013-04-24
4.0,The show started out great. It was mostly funny and loved all the characters.  This season though It seems like there is no clear direction. The comedy is not as funny as it was in previous seasons. I hope it gets better in upcoming episodes.,1392249600,2014-02-13

5.0,I love the series of books by Michael Connelly! This story was a great place to start for the pilot. Viewers get to see glimpses of Bosch's past and how it makes him who he is at present. I hope it makes for the whole season plus some. I would even like movies about Harry Bosch. They could tie them with the Lincoln Lawyer as they are half brothers.

4.0,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:Taken from a 2006 BBC 2-part mini-series.  The aforementioned Mark Strong and Lennie James play Detroit cops Frank Andrews and Joe Geddes.  Mr. Strong's credentials include everything from ""Sherlock Holmes"" to ""Kick-Ass"" while no less impressive, Mr. James is likely best known to US audiences for his 2-year stint on ""Jericho"".There is a very good supporting cast, including David Costabile (""The Wire"" & ""Suits""), Sprague Grayden (Season 7 - ""24"") and several alumnus from ""Generation Kill""So a cop show set in Detroit?  ""Detroit 1-8-7"" received a score of ""63"" on Metacritic (review aggregator), while ""Low Winter Sun"" received a score of ""60"".  However, I like LWS much better than the former.  I like the imagery of the Detroit backdrop, the potential for a multi-layered plot, which includes elements of flawed personalities and the ""Old School Mafia"" versus the ""Young Turks"".  I don't see this as a show that will be easy for someone to fall in love with by virtue of one 43-minute episode.  If AMC made a mistake here it was not debuting with double episode.I say for the acting ""chops"" alone, give LWS a chance, with the potential to be either upgraded or downgraded a * consistent with the direction of the storylines.",1376352000,2013-08-13
3.0,"If you enjoy Mother Nature, you should enjoy this show.  I'm not sure that you'll fall in love with it, but I think you'll get through Season 1 on Amazon, since it's free right now.  However, it appears we have to pay for Season 2, which I would never do.  There are 3 main characters in Mountain Men.  All three live relatively different lives in different areas of the country, which is good and diverse for us viewers.  Of course, the producers of the show add some drama, which is sometimes realistic.  On one show, the guy in Alaska breaks down (his snowmobile) 10 miles from his cabin, and he has to walk the entire distance in the dark and the sub-zero temps.  Now, that was real!  I could feel his pain.  Overall, there are some decent situations and activities for these guys.

I was actually glued to my computer as I watched the pilot while streaming (Prime membership).  The characters are believable and I even had pity for them, especially the sheriff - his pacemaker blew out and he died pretty much instantaneously.  I wanted to know who Barbie was - a man named Barbie could not have had a good upbringing.  I wanted to know who all the characters were.  I wanted to know why and how this dome came into being. I can't wait til the next episode is available.  I've just started reading the book - it's over 800 pages, so I hope to come up with some answers.

5.0,"This documentary about the home video/VCR boom leaves no stone unturned.  It's primarily gonna appeal to, not only people who lived through the era, but people who were really into movies, especially cult films.  A lot of screen time is dedicated to cult and horror films, and there are many interviews with people from that scene like Frank Hennenlotter and Lloyd Kaufman.  This makes sense considering it's the cult audience that still embraces the VHS format.  Your average Avengers fan is really less likely to care.It's a very thorough documentary, covering the birth of the format, the companies that utilized it, the modern day collectors and even a VHS merchant who still runs a shop.  Lots of ground is covered, and it's clear that this documentary was a labor of love.  For folks like me, it's a very welcome trip down memory lane.  In fact, kinda depressing in a way.  Very highly recommended though!",1402012800,2014-06-06
3.0,"I don't know if it was the movie, the lack of hysterical commentary or just me, but this wasn't one of KST3K's best efforts.  Outside of Forest Tucker jokes (which are always worth a laugh) there wasn't enough bad material to keep the show going.  Took me 3 sessions to finish it all off, at which point I was happy to see it over as opposed to wishing it would keep on going.But, as they say, even a bad MST3K is better than a good day at work.",1372550400,2013-06-30

4.0,"update to original review: i just saw the last episode and came back to my review and knocked it down a star. there is no getting around that the new person in charge of the series made a big mistake in deciding to take a big deviation from the comic book.  the comic book has lasted a decade because its author knows his characters really well. Thus his concept of governor was as a one shot limited villain. there was no need to go on and on with him as a depraved leader. unfortunately, that is what the new series creative director decided to do.  after three episodes of wallowing in the character of the governor, i was ready to scream.  the uk actor had done a nice job until he was overutilized to this extent.  i knew that the creative director for series three was let go for artistic differences with AMC but how could AMC have been so stupid as to think it could milk the governor to this extent?  i can only surmise that it got greedy and wanted to make more money out of the governor subplot. my eatlier review was before i saw three back to back episodes of wallowing in the character of the governor.  i had to come back and amend the review.  the series comes back in february and unfortunately, the same series director is in charge.  my original review reflects our starting out gloriously but i now have my doubts.  AMC was incredibly stupid to fire the guy in charge of making series three. he was perfect. at this point i only knocked it down one star. come february's return, it may lose another one...or two.my original review follows and it was way, way too optimistic.this began as a comic book by robert kirkwood and we are now up to the 115th issue.  the comic is also great.  right from the beginning of the tv show, there were some differences between the comic and show.  the biggest of these is that Darryl, one of the favorite characters on the show, did not exist in the comics.  Nor did his brother. I think everyone agrees this was a marvelous addition to the tv show. in season four though, we take a huge deviation from the comic series.  this deviation is keeping them at the prison and then having a second wave of illness, the flu, turn people into zombies as well. in the comic, they are gone from the prison after the whole story arc of the governor. they are en route to somewhere else and there is no flu. so keeping them at the prison and introducing this flu like disease to invade their ranks is a huge turn into a story line which simply does not exist in the comic. having said all of this, i don't think this deviation is hurting the show in the slightest. all of these new developments are making for great weekly viewing. one other difference going on is that the comic kills off different people from the tv show.  the biggest deviation which occurred there was the comic has a character as Rick's love interest who was killed off in last season of the tv show!i frankly have always hated the zombie concept. yet i couldn't believe how good this show and comic were.  nor could i believe how good Max Brooks' novel was, WORLD WAR Z. I think that what makes these work is that they are more about human beings going on against overwhelming, catastrophic odds. they manage to form a community, pick a leader, try and make a future for themselves and mankind",1382918400,2013-10-28

5.0,"The Disappearance of Alice Creed is a REALLY good thriller.  It's about two kidnappers that hold a young girl at ransom for 2 million dollars.  They come up with the perfect plan, the likes of which is completely original in all the years I've been watching movies with a similar concept.  And EXCITING?  You bet!To be totally honest, it would be a great disservice to explain in detail the way these events unfold because the way the story is written, spoiling the MANY twists and turns here on amazon would be an unfortune shame, so I can't do it.  Let's just say, there's an extremely good chance you've never seen a kidnappping plot quite like this one!  The ONLY thing I'll say is that one of the kidnappers is actually in a relationship with the girl tied down to the bed.  This leads to several more awesome segments and twists.  Oh and, betrayal and hiding the clues might be the key words to describe this movie, hehe.  Right down to the ending I had no idea which way the writers were taking this one- another sign of successfully executed storytelling.There's a couple sexual related scenes that are pretty strong, but other than that, expect to be on the edge of your seat anticipating all the ways these two masked men figure out exactly the right plan to obtain the money.  Actor Eddie Marsan is *tremendous* as a kidnapper.  A really believable looking and intimidating bad guy- perfect for the role.  He makes the movie as excellent as can be.  Highly recommended.",1360627200,2013-02-12
5.0,"Which means you already know what I think of this simply amazing, too good for TV scripted show that NOBODY is watching, hence I get, I think 11 more episodes until my heart is once again broken as I salute the end of another absolutely outstanding television show. I am with both reviewers of TV Guide and USAToday who have tirelessly and shamelessly promoted this show (who both often will try to push a Friday night show opposite it, ie: ""you can watch so and so for some slightly decent entertainment, or you can crawl out of your it's the end of the week and I'm tired and don't want my brain to work too hard malaise and watch Fringe for truly intelligent, well-acted, excellent entertainment"" (sic). I do have to say that putting Grimm up against Fringe is simply Hollywood being rude again as if there is a real choice. I mean, Fringe has been on a lot longer, but has continued to get better and better for the three of us watching it. Grimm is pretty much on a par with Fringe, in creativity and intelligence and lovely quirky characters (seriously, Walter or Monroe? As if we have a choice!), but I think I'm just being bitter again.Admittedly, Fringe had a bit of a stuttering beginning, but I don't believe I've ever seen a sci fi show that didn't (I'll reference Eureka here, which in my opinion had about the worst first year of any sci fi show I've seen - fast forward to its final show that I used up a box of Kleenex as my heart broke watching what became, to me,  as close to the perfection of Firefly we have gotten on the entertainment medium called scripted television). Fringe, for those of you who abandoned it for whatever reasons, thus making me soon face another evening wrapped in my favorite blankie, box of Kleenex on hand as I once again, pay homage to the finale of sci fi perfection, will forever be burned into my memory with its wonderful cast of characters - Olivia, Peter, Astrid, and the ultimate arguably best character since Capt. Malcolm Reynolds of Firefly, Walter, presumably *SPOILER ALERT* defeat the Observers as they seek to strip earth of whatever they need and move on to do the same to another hapless planet. And honestly? How did they find the perfect actress to play Etta - who is the spitting image of Olivia with Peter's eyes?While I am grateful that we get with Fringe what we have not gotten from countless other wonderful shows (she says, bitterly, still wondering just what The Event was even after two or three years). So I should be grateful to Fox who has been far more generous overall than other networks *cough* NBC *cough* for giving us closure (ie:Prison Break). But really, I couldn't say it better than either the TV Guide guy OR the USAToday guy who have shamelessly and bravely stood up for this truly brilliant show (although without ant compensation) - THIS is not Fox's fault. It is our's. After all Fox is a business and has continued to allow the same 3.5 million viewers (paltry in network world) the privilege of this intelligent, exceptional scripted show far longer than the numbers game should have allowed. We all make choices with what little time we have these days - especially in the only demographic that counts which boggles my mind - those 18 - 49ers who are simply too busy raising families, working to pay the bills or attending whatever event or child-centered Friday night delight to watch an original brand new Steven Spielberg offering let alone a simple TV show. No matter that those of us OVER the age of 49 have made our money and probably have more discretionary income to spend on most advertisers wares - but I'm on my weighted soap box again. I think even Fox was hoping that the final season of Fringe would garner more than the usual 3.5 million voters as I read the comments when they announced them. I think even Fox would have liked another year of this wonderfully odd cast and the many stories left to tell about them. But alas, for whatever reasons, we, the People, have spoken and Fringe will soon be no more. Some day, people who could have made a difference now WILL find and watch Fringe and wish they'd watched it when it mattered. So do I. So do I!",1349654400,2012-10-08
5.0,"I genuinely enjoyed this show. At first it might not make sense for the family to get powers after an airplane accident, but that is explained later in the season, no biggie. One of the things I liked about this show was how the family developed their powers and learned to use them or gain new facets of their power, like Daphne's mental abilities. I really am sad this show was cancelled.I do spot something that I would have done differently (spoiler alert) In the last episode of this show, Ms. X talked about power permanence and trying to figure out a way to attain a permanent power. She decides to give a planeload of criminals permanent powers after forcing the secret out of J.J. I see one problem with this - former employees of King and Ms. X were forced to report back to them for regular shots of Trillsettium, which kept them under their control - no 'medicine', you die. Power permanence means that these criminals would not be dependent on Ms. X, causing her to lose power over them. She should have done the procedure to herself instead of criminals who you know would just cause more trouble after the fact.",1339372800,2012-06-11

3.0,"I'm a fan of Lennie James from the Walking Dead and Jericho.  However, this series really doesn't do it for me. It's kind of hard to follow and the plot is just not that interesting to me. The basis for the series is a deceased dirty cop who is being invested by Internal Affairs. It seems to me there are no good guys in this one. Everybody is corrupt - so it's hard to root for anyone. I really don't have a vested interest in any of the characters at this point (like I did with ""Morgan"" when he first appeared in TWD). Also, I don't like the continual flashbacks. Other viewers may enjoy it, but the flow is slightly weird to me. On a separate note, I applaud Amazon for offering this on a ""pay as you go"" plan. Since I don't have AMC, I'm currently using this method to pay for The Walking Dead episodes as well as Breaking Bad. But I've decided this is one show I can live without.",1377993600,2013-09-01

3.0,"Beth (Rebecca Hall) is a dreamer. Moving from her Southern roots to Vegas with dreams of stepping up in life and becoming a cocktail waitress (yes that is her initial ambition) she moves into a low rent motel where she makes friends who give her another option. Rather than be manhandled all day they send her to Dink (Bruce Willis), a professional gambler who bets on any and everything.Dink Inc. is a business where the odds are always manipulated by the placing of bets in legal form. Not only does this pay Dink well but it helps take care of those who are working for him as well. With a head for numbers, Beth is a natural and soon Dink Inc. is doing well and Beth with it. Now all she has to do is get past Tulip (Catherine Zeta-Jones).Tulip is Dink's wife and to say she is jealous is an understatement. Then again there have been times when her jealousy was well founded. As Beth begins to fall for Dink and attempt to sway him, Tulip steps in and puts an end to it. Beth loses her job, meets a young man named Jeremy (Joshua Jackson) and its love at first sight. With no reason to stay she plans on going back to New York with Jeremy when he leaves. But Dink is in a slump of bad luck and he thinks Beth was his good luck charm so he convinces her to come back.Beth's return doesn't increase Dink's luck any more than the rising sun. Within days he tosses her and his whole team out again. Unwilling to wait around another day, Beth heads to New York and Jeremy. Once there she contacts Rosie (Vince Vaughan), a low life illegal bookie she met through Dink, and helps him run his business. Plans are to set up in the Caribbean where gambling is legal with Beth running the show. As always, things don't go as planned.Soon Beth finds herself and Jeremy with the possibility of going to jail on federal gambling charges. Rosie is no help, a self centered low life who could care less who gets hurt, something Dink warned Beth about when she first met Rosie. Back on top with Tulip convinced there was never anything going on with Beth or the chance that it will, Dink and Tulip head to New York in an attempt to save the day.The movie is directed by Stephen Frears who made THE GRIFTERS, THE QUEEN and DANGEROUS LIASONS. With those titles to his credit, expectations for this film are high. Unfortunately they don't come close to those other films. That's not to say this film isn't interesting or even fun, but don't have high expectations and you might just enjoy it.The film is well made and looks top of the line in the production values area. For not being hyped as the hottest thing out of Hollywood, Hall turns in a worthwhile performance and makes her naive character quite believable. Zeta-Jones does a great job as well in a role that doesn't require her to exude sex non-stop for once. Best of all is Willis who gets the chance to play a character that doesn't shoot anyone or blow things up. Sometimes people forget what a good actor he actually is.While this film isn't Oscar material it does offer a nice evening's entertainment. Based on the memoirs of the real Beth, it might even stir up enough interest in her story to sell a few books. If not it will at least encourage a trip to the library.",1362614400,2013-03-07

4.0,"Bottom Line: Somewhat campy, but an enjoyable somewhat light hearted version of Batman. I enjoyed the artwork and most if not all of the stories in the series.Let's get serious; any superhero cartoon is inherently a fantasy story. If someone actually tried to apprehend criminals the way Batman does in any of the comic books, movies, or television shows, then the police would hunt him down and kill him. So, there is an implied balance between the fantasy and the ""realistic"" elements of the superhero story. In the case of BATMAN: The Brave and the Bold, the stories are more light-hearted and campy with the balance clearly leaning toward the fantasy side of the story.I tend to agree with many of the other viewers that of all the Batman television series,Batman: The Complete Animated Seriesdoes the best job of finding an entertaining balance, but that doesn't mean that you should completely discount BATMAN: The Brave and The Bold.However, if you prefer you Batman to be only dark and tormented, then this series isn't for you. If you can enjoy a Batman that is a bit of a parody of himself, then this might be something you can enjoy. Likewise, while child suitable, there are some jokes that clearly aimed at the parents.",1376524800,2013-08-15

5.0,"With almost every season of South Park you always have the odd one or two episodes that weren't really that good. Season 1 it was Weight Gain 4000, Season 2 it was Terrence & Phillip in not without my Anus and so on, as with all seasons although you have the bad episodes, you always have your personal favourites but Season 11 is in my personal view the strongest and most unique season to date. With episodes ranging from racial controversy to a trilogy of episodes setting the boys in Imaginationland and ended up with its own DVD releases.Episode 1: With Apologies To Jesse Jackson: This is a Randy Marsh episode and shows the true no holds barred attitude that Matt Stone & Trey Parker have towards writing an episode. Randy is on an episode of Wheel of Fortune and accidentally uses the N word, which causes an uproar and singles Randy out as ""That N***er Guy."" This episode is obviously a reflection on the American society in relation to the N word and satires the whole subject, extremely funny episode with some great one liners.Episode 2: Cartman Sucks: Again this is another controversial episode but this one is entirely around Cartman, of a night Cartman has Butters stay over at his house and while Butters is asleep, Cartman plays pranks on Butters then takes pictures of it. One prank backfires on Cartman which he's afraid will make people think he's gay, he thinks Kyle has the picture and is ready to show it to the class so Cartman enters on a panicky mission to try and save his skin. Amazingly funny as we see Cartman show some vulnerability.Episode 3: Lice Capades: One of the boys has head lice and Cartman leads a mission to try and find out who it is. Meanwhile in one of the boys heads one of the lice suspects that their environment will be aware of the affect the lice are having and may try to get rid of them. Now it's a race against time to try and convince the Lice that the environment wants to get rid of them. A great parody episode that shows the evil side of Cartman as he goes on this manhunt simply to make fun of the person with lice.Episode 4: The Snuke: One day while in class a young Muslim boy is introduced as the new student, Cartman becomes suspicious that he may be a terrorist and enlists Kyle to help him look into the background of this kid. In a 24 style episode Cartman unwittingly discovers a conspiracy to take down America and its government. This is possibly THE most controversial episode of them all as it made the news in England for the ending, the clear parody of Hilary Clinton is hysterical and makes this an enjoyable episode.Episode 5: Fantastic Easter Special: Stan starts to question the point of Easter which brings him into a conspiracy that has been kept a secret for 2000 years. A great parody of the Da Vinci Code that sees the return of Jesus in one hell of a cool setting and Kyle being Jewish has the opportunity to kill Jesus, will he do it? Enjoy this episode to find out.Episode 6: D-Yikes: Mrs. Garrison is dumped again and she takes it out on the class, the boys get sick of the constant screaming and ranting by Mrs. Garrison and they employ someone to help them out. A classic Mr./Mrs. Garrison episode with one hysterical ending.Episode 7: Night of the Living Homeless: Kyle is approached by a single Homeless man who's looking for some change, after giving the homeless man change more homeless people show up in South Park until it becomes an infestation. Cartman creates a goal for himself to jump as many homeless people as he can on his skateboard, while Kyle and the rest of the gang are on a mission to solve the Homeless problem. This is a great parody episode of Night of the Living Dead which gives yet another great part to Randy and shows how stupid he can be.Episode 8: Le Petit Tourette: One day whilst in a toy store, Cartman discovers something wonderful, something that he never believed that could be possible, he discovered Tourettes Syndrome. He sees a kid swearing and getting away with it and he decides that this would be a great excuse to insult those he hates to their faces and get away with it, little does he know however that him being Tourettes deliberately developes into something much worse which he didn't expect.Episode 9: More Crap: Another great Randy Marsh episode, in which Randy endeavours on having the worlds biggest poo, He's faced by some competition however, by the legendary number one at everything, Bono. I have to admit this is the weakest of all the episodes but it still has its classic moments, especially when Bono is in the picture.Episode 10,11,12: Imaginationland: One day Cartman is out to prove to Kyle that Leprechauns exist, the boys made a deal that if Cartman can prove they exist then Kyle must suck his balls. Cartman does manage to capture a Leprechaun but it was on a mission to deliver a warning to Imaginationland of a pending terrorist attack on our imagination. The boys are picked up by an eccentric man who takes the boys to Imaginationland which while they're there the terrorist attack takes place. Kyle, Stan & Butters enter on a mission to help fight the bad side of our Imagination and the terrorists, whilst Cartman sets out to prove that the Leprechaun was real so he can get Kyle to suck his Balls. An absolutely hysterical trilogy of episodes that show the genuine imagination of the South Park creators.Episode 13:  Guitar Queer-o: Stan and Kyle are the best players on the computer game Guitar Hero and they are signed by a record company who wants to display their skills by then gaining 100,000 points at a show in the arcade. Kyle gets manipulated by the record company and is convinced to get a new and better partner, Stan takes it badly and buys a new game called heroin hero in which he must chase the dragon. Again this is an incredibly funny episode that makes fun of those who take these games seriously and spend way too much time on them.Episode 14: The List: The girls of South Park elementary create a list of who they think the cutest boy in the school is. Kyle is placed last on the list but can't believe that he was placed lower on the list than Cartman, this uncovers a conspiracy that the boys would have never expected. It's a great episode that gives us a nostalgic look at some classic moments from previous episodes.As you can see from the descriptions this is a great set of episodes that everybody should own.",1214265600,2008-06-24

4.0,"Amazon hooked me with the premiere episode. This is the first of their Amazon Studios series. I took part in the voting for these proposed films, and the actors, the characters and their storyline was humorous and looked close to real life.This series stars John Goodman, Clark Johnson, Matt Malloy and Mark Consuelos as four Republican senators sharing the same house in Washington, D.C. This is akin tomDemocratic Senator Schumer and three more of his Dem counterparts. This series exploits the problems and issues faced by these senators. The Tea Party running against them, ethics and moral issues, making bills and trying to find your place in DC. Three of these senators are fixtures in DC. Mark Consuelos plays a new senator, newly divorced and recently taken up with a lively, wealthy constituent.The stories are realistic, the staff members play a big part in this series. All of them well chosen, some more humorous than others, full of basic instincts and trying to do their best for their country and themselves. This series could be about any party, the GOP was chosen to give more issues to homosexuality, the Tea Party and other issues that we can find a great deal of humor. So far the series is a winner. Every Friday, a new episode is added.Recommended. prisrob 01-04-14",1384041600,2013-11-10

5.0,"I started watching Drop Dead Diva on Netflix and quickly became addicted to the show.  There is this innocence and intelligence that draws me in.  There are times when I am both happy for and angry at the character of Jane.  There were some odd twists in Season 5 and I hope that Season 6 is not truly the end to this great show.  This show has a combination of real characters, great acting, intense plots and intelligent law cases.  You will find yourself rooting for Jane and being hooked with each episode.  I openly admit that I have a strong dislike towards the typical shows that is presented by the Life Time Channel.  I dislike the shows that all have the same plots and are sappy chick flicks.  This is the best thing to come from Life Time and I hope this season's reviews are so great that the show is signed on for many more!",1395792000,2014-03-26
5.0,"I loved the story of Amy Dorrit, the child of the Marshalsea Prison, which was where she was born and where, at the beginning of the novel she still lives with her aging father, The Father of the Marshalsea. The Marshalsea is a debtor's prison Dicken's father had resided in the Marshalsea after he fell on hard times and although Dickens did not reside in the Marshalsea, he did visit his family there on Sundays.If a man is thrown into prison due to his inability to pay his debts, how is he then to pay his debts while in prison? His children leave daily with their mother, if there is one, to work. Amy Dorrit leaves the prison daily under the admiring eyes of Joe, the gatekeeper and works for Mrs. Clennam, the paralyzed matriarch of a family business. There Amy meets Arthur Clennam a much older man who is visiting his mother and who has spent years abroad working with his father. Arthur has returned to London due to his father's death.Social justice and social class again define this Dicken's novel. Amy is a working girl while Arthur is merchant class; Mrs. Clennam sees herself as something more than merchant class, although the house she is trapped in which symbolizes herself and her facade, is falling down. Joe loves Amy and wants to marry her and keep her at the Marshalsea. Amy loves Arthur but Arthur won't admit that he loves Amy, he thinks he loves &#34;Pet&#34; and the plot, so cunningly devised, goes round and round.Great characters. Great settings. Fabulous film and I will watch it again.",1388880000,2014-01-05

5.0,I love this show and am bitterly disappointed it was canceled before it really got going. The writers handed the twisting story lines expertly and made sure to give all the Avengers enough face time to make the viewers care about each one of them.

4.0,"This film is about things that are reversed:  people look in the mirror and see the reverse image.  They look into X-rays and see a heart that's on the wrong side.  They look at their spouses and don't recognize them at all.  But it's also about things that are broken:  those same mirrors moments later, the windshields in their cars, and even broken people and relationships.It's hard to review this film in a way, because if you discuss any of the plot, it seems that you may be introducing a spoiler.  But in reality, even after watching, I'm not completely convinced that I know exactly what happened.  I will say that I considered an alternate universe idea -- with an evil doppelganger, perhaps everyone has one (physicists would argue that there are infinite universes, and in each of those, at least where ""you"" exist, ""you"" are different) -- and I did consider the old she-died-and-is-in-purgatory-but-doesn't-know-it-yet idea.  But the ending seems to at least dispel the latter.  I'm still not sure about the former.This film was filmed mostly in London, a city where I have been.  I liked ""The Tube"" scenes.  ""Mind the gap!"" is all that I could think about while watching those scenes, especially when the lead risks her life to fish a photograph off of the tracks.  At any rate, ""mind the gap!"" is surely advice that Americans should heed more often here in the States.  Especially lately.I also really liked the color palette that the director chose; mostly cool and cold blues to set the mood and tone.  And I definitely liked the fact that this was more of a psychological thriller than what Hollywood seems to like to pump out on a constant basis.  Aren't you as sick as I of all those slasher flicks?  At least this is a ""thinking man's"" -- or ""woman's"" -- film I suppose, even though I'm not convinced that all that thinking did me much good figuring out what was really going on.Maybe more of a 3.5, but I'll round up and give them an A- (or B+) for effort.  For execution?  I'll let you decide on a minor recommendation.",1364428800,2013-03-28

The writers apparently are not willing to consider that other perspectives would add a &#34;real-life&#34; element and interesting depth to the obvious biases they have bought to the table that have already played out in the first two seasons.

5.0,"The Troll Hunter or Trolljegeren is a Norwegian monster movie portrayed as if it is real recovered footage of a man who hunts trolls and the student journalists who follow him.  It is written and directed by Andr&eacute; vredal, a name to keep an eye on for sure.  Here is a film that works with a modest budget and takes an absolutely absurd concept and somehow forces it through as realistic a lens as possible.  Sure, it's easy now to just brush off these mokumentary movies as gimmicks, because there have been quite a few of them fromMan Bites DogtoThe Blair Witch Projectand to the more recentQuarantine(or the superior movie[Rec] that it was based on).  There have been misses of course with this method but more often than not its use has been effective in making a scenario seem more authentic and the horror of it all the more compelling and enjoyable.  I'm past believing the mokumentary set-up is hackneyed now.  It seems to me a very legitimate way of making movies seem more real, especially in an age where computerized images dominate big budget Hollywood pictures and unwittingly request that real cinephiles stretch our suspension of disbelief well beyond at least my own comfort zone.  So I'm a proponent of the possibilities of the mokumentary horror film after watching this little gem that contains all the elements to make every frame fun and believable.  It is particularly highlighted by Otto Jespersen's Hans; the film's title role.  His dead pan demeanor and casual actions in bizarrely twisted situations bring a welcome dry humor that had me chuckling regularly as I enjoyed The Troll Hunter.  Jespersen offers up a Bill Murray-like performance in a role that is clearly not written for a comedian, but is most definitely and quite potently delivered by one.  He is terrific in this movie.A group of naive student journalists sets out to track down and document a supposed bear poacher.  This is Hans (Jespersen) and he is very reluctant to respond to their inquiries about his activities.  They follow Hans all over Western Norway until they finally discover what he is really doing.  After they figure this out he lets them follow and film him as he goes about his unique occupation.  The moment when the students know for sure what Hans is really up to will test your imagination or make you laugh hysterically, or maybe even a little bit of both.  At that moment I wasn't really sure what I was watching but I knew one thing; I loved it.The natural performances by the rest of the cast are not to be overlooked.  These are talented young actors that help make the film much more than a simple one trick monster movie.  The Troll Hunter should also be commended for being shot on location in the mountains of Western Norway.  It couldn't have been an easy shoot for anyone but again it lends itself in an attempt to make an off-the-wall concept filmmable and compelling.  I suspect massive international attention for The Troll Hunter soon enough, and it deserves it.  This has cult classic written all over it.",1307318400,2011-06-06
5.0,"I watch TV shows for their characters and decent storylines.  Clearly, good acting is important to achieve both of those elements with any panache.  As always, Midsomer Murders captures a charming and delightful approach to criminal investigation.  Tom Barnaby IS the show, however, and with his departure in season 20 I realized I won't be continuing to buy every season as it comes out on DVD (pre-ordering in fact which I don't do for anything else!).  Anyway, back to this season of Midsomer--while there is always an occasional episode that isn't stellar throughout the history of the show, there is never one that is less than enjoyable and if you've liked most of the seasons before this one, you won't be disappointed.Midsomer has wonderful production values, amazingly well-known special guest stars, and has an elemental of humorous charm in the character of Inspector Tom Barnaby.  One of the things I most like about all of the Midsomer seasons is that I can rewatch them and feel like I am surrounded by intelligent and comforting friends.  The complexity of characters and the motives that drive the murders always leaves me feeling like I enjoyed it as much the second or third time.  And the feel-good ending of each and every episode is the final piece of magic that Midsomer brings to its viewers.",1345939200,2012-08-26

5.0,"What can I add about this very clever and hilarious TV series, which I just discovered even though it's in its sixth season, when there are already 441 reviews posted here? Probably not much but I'll try.Though the Complete First Season has been released before, a new ""Combo Pack"" is now out (as of July 10th) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package. (So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again.). For those folks who complained that the only ""bonus"" in the original First Season set was the ""Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory"" featurette, you'll be happy to know that they added a gag reel this time. I'm not sure that is enough to replace your earlier set but it's a nice bonus for those - like me - just discovering it.There's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again, it's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after the first for or five episodes (which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips: you can't stop with just one) the characters changes in odd ways. Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy (plus she must have lost her job at The Cheesecake Factory because by the fourth episode or so she is serving the ""guys"" at a local hamburger place in a non-TCCF uniform.The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer - and I don't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a ""laugh track"" which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences. It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over, sometimes even before the punch line. It bothered me a lot during the first three episodes but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on. It's just too bad that they felt need to use these.So, I'm jumping on the bandwagon for this series and in the process of ""catching up"". If you've read this review before the others, I hope I've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more. Better yet, just sample an episode and , like me, I'm sure you will get hooked!I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",1341187200,2012-07-02

1.0,"The first 20 minutes or so the dialogue and acting led me think that a creative, well written and produced haunted movie was in the works. Wrong! They either quickly ran out of writing inspiration or money or both. It quickly fell into a cheap formulaic abyss. The rest of the movie moves like redundant molasses.Proof?(1.) Well, lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over.(2.) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound. Duh, digital has been around for decades and, anyway, they have a limited frequency and amplitude range, so what's the point.(3.) Usual, couple of guests that add nothing to the story and you're left wondering why they were even in the story. Well, one guy decides to slit his wrists, in a bathtub, of course.(4.) Usual, mysterious sounds - well, they are in an old hotel!(5.) The usual mysterious self-closing door. Actually, a prop person standing behind and pushing it. Scary!(6.) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn. Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes.(7.) Usual chain locked cellar door.Spoiler follows:(8.) Usual girl starts imaging ghosts and locks herself in the basement to subsequently die of fright complications thinking a ghost is chasing her but it's her co-worker banging on the door.",1336521600,2012-05-09

The skill of the dancers is Heaven to watch. They are sweet, real kids who obviously love what they do and want very badly to please the judges and parents.However, Abby Lee Miller's character unfolds as increasingly abrasive. At times she loses my admiration as a dedicated teacher. Instead, I sometimes view her as a narcissistic parent pitting one child against the other to hold her approval. The Moms, however, are often more childish than their offspring. Please make note I called them childish, not childlike!In the end, it is the children who bring me back for every single episode. Will their constant efforts to succeed get them past the manipulations and warfare of the adults around them? And, make no mistake, this is a skill they must develop very well, because the world of professional dance is cut-throat.

2.0,"Okay, let me see if I can guess the inspiration for this show.  Producer finds himself at a classical music concert and starts fantasizing about the orchestra (particularly the hot ones) and thinks ""man, I bet those stiffs are party animals offstage, whoa.... I should totally make a show about snobby, artsy-fartsy musicians acting like out-of-control high-school students"".  Now for the title: if we say ""Shostakovich in the Jungle"" nobody's gonna have a clue what we're talking about and if you go with Handel most peeps only know one of his pieces (which would totally send the wrong message); ""Immortal Beloved"" definitely made Beethoven seem kinda sexy, maybe a little angry but hey.... what about that 80's romantic fantasy ""Amadeus"".... ya, that's the ticket.So what's in a name?  Well, I hate to sound like a wet blanket but just maybe the creators of this show should've tried reading the lyrics to one of the composer's greatest works (Requiem in D Minor) before they associated his name with recreational sex, chemical dependency and towering ego's devoid of any respect for either the music they're playing or the people they're playing it with.  :(",1391990400,2014-02-10
3.0,"The series started off pretty good.  It was a fresh approach the first ten minutes, but then began the stereotypical misunderstood cop. The supporting cast  was good, except for the  &#34;older&#34; police woman.  She was just too old to be starting out to be a police woman at this stage of life.  She looked old enough to be ready for retirement.  She should have been in her middle to late thirties, but looked well into her forties.  Just a flaw in the casting, but one that was  jarring.  The protagonist, Bosch, appeared to be weak.  He had the appearance of being jaded.  He needs to have more character.. Its an okay series, but one that I probably wouldn't seek out to see, but might watch if there wasn't anything else to watch.  As long as I had a book to read while the series played in the back ground I would watch it.  Bosch just wasn't a character that I cared about. It's not the actors fault.  He's a good supporting actor, but he won't be able to carry the show as long as the script is as poor as it is. There was too much happening in the pilot.  Everything was thrown in at once and cliches were used to prop it up.",1392854400,2014-02-20

5.0,"Someone described this before as the X files meets Twin Peaks, and they weren't wrong. But I think it may be even slightly better, as if those two shows weren't already wonderful.This is fresh and lightly done weirdness, with a picturesque town that seems almost normal, and yet just isn't quite. Full of characters, excellent twists on the mutant powers seen in X men and so many other works of fantasy, but described as troubles rather then gifts, mainly because whatever the new guy has got as his or her talent, just isn't under his control. And half the mystery of each show is simply trying to work out what power is at work and who has it, because they don't make it obvious early on.Best of all though, the ending. I won't give away any spoilers, but the twists were unexpected, not telegraphed in any way, and better yet, it doesn't explain all the mysteries. It saves that for season two.I can't wait.Cheers.",1311206400,2011-07-21

2.0,"Nine Things about The Canyons1. This movie was written by Bret Easton Ellis and directed by Paul Schrader. If you know those names, you will have a pretty good idea what this movie is about. If you don&#8217;t know those names, how about this: It stars Lindsay Lohan and porn star James Deen.2. Paul Schrader summarized the movie the best &#8211; it&#8217;s about beautiful people doing bad things in nice rooms.3. More specifically, it&#8217;s about a girl that wants to make a movie, and she gets her boyfriend cast in it by convincing the producer&#8217;s assistant that he would be a great choice. And they are all secretly cheating on each other. With each other.4. A lot of people, including myself, were looking forward to this movie. It could have been edgy, dark, and hip. The key term here is &#8220;could have been&#8221;.5. This movie is a mess. It turned itself into a parody of what it was trying to do. The acting is terrible. The story is ludicrous, which is especially frustrating to me because Ellis is one of my all-time favorite authors.6. When I say the acting is terrible, there is one exception. Believe it or not, Lindsay Lohan did pretty well. She was the best part of the film. Porn star James Deen has the acting ability of, well, a porn star. Let&#8217;s just leave it at that.7. I do have to give the movie points for having the guts to show male full-frontal nudity, instead of just female nudity.8. The movie is interesting on a meta-level in that you can see how the movie was made. It was funded on Kickstarter and cast through a website. This is obvious. The budget is so low (reportedly, the actors were paid $100 a day) that you can actually see how the thing was put together.9. Fans of bad movies may find this entertaining. It tries so hard to be serious that it turns into a comedy. But as an actual movie, this was one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me.",1387756800,2013-12-23

5.0,"Vikings had a rough start, the first few episodes found itself struggling with identity...did it want to be Game of Thrones? did it want to be a serious drama? comedy? historical documentary?....but at the start of the forth episode things got smoothed out and turned into a amazing, fantastic show...even early on, there was a immediate danger present that keeps you glued...gorgeous, brutal, and serious....VIKINGS is amazing. not for kids.right on, History Channel!!",1392595200,2014-02-17
5.0,"First, an important caution when reading reviews of this product. Amazon has a policy of grouping all reviews of all formats of a film (theater, Amazon Instant  DVD, BD) together. As I submit this review there are already 23 reviews posted, only one of which is of the DVD or Bluray. So, I always suggest to look to see which product is being reviewed and to look for the date of the review. That will guide you best. Now on to my review of the Bluray.Of  the thousands of reviews I&#8217;ve written for Amazon I&#8217;ve rarely &#8211; if ever &#8211; felt that there was another review of a product that covered practically everything one could say about it. But after reading David Kusumoto&#8217;s review of the Bluray/DVD release of this film, I have to send you there for a thorough and well-written review. I&#8217;ll try to add a few more facts and my take on the film and the package.&#8220;Good Ol&#8217; Freda&#8221; started making the film festival circuit in early 2013 and played at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia in April 2013. I missed that one shot chance to catch it, but heard great things from friends and was anxious for the home video release. Magnolia films has been making a name for itself in releasing music related documentaries (&#8220;Muscle Shoals&#8221; was also at the April WXPN festival &#8211; and I did catch it and it&#8217;s great &#8211; and Magnolia will be releasing it in January (hopefully with lots of bonuses). But back to Freda.As David pointed out in his review, there is a wonderful commentary track that reveals more stories than are shone in the film. But, remember that Freda was a loyal dedicated secretary for 11 years (one year LONGER than the Beatles were together as a band) and no real secrets are revealed. But, when she discusses the parents of the &#8220;boys&#8221; &#8211; especially weekly teas with Ringo&#8217;s mom (she only refers to Ringo as &#8220;Ringo&#8221; in the Q&A; at at Beatlefest  - included as a bonus; in the film he is always called &#8220;Richie&#8221; and Brian Epstein is called &#8220;Eppie&#8221;  - you get a deeper feeling for the family life of the Fab Four.In one of the bonus interviews with the Director of the film, we learn that he shot 50 hours of film and says that he hopes that much of it would be on the DVD release. But there are only five scenes totaling just 12 minutes. (I&#8217;m not complaining &#8211; just commenting).As noted by others &#8211; four Beatles songs are included in the soundtrack, along with a bunch of classic songs that the Beatles covered (by Arthurs Alexander, The Chiffons, Marvelettes) including the most expensive to license: Ketty Lester&#8217;s &#8220;Love Letters&#8221;. Oddly enough the Lester recording was not remastered and has lots of &#8220;crackle&#8221;. Surely they could have found a better copy to use. (again, a comment, not a complaint.So, in summary, all Beatles fans will want this Bluray, even if you have seen the film at a festival. And, even if you are a casual music listener who grew up with their music, you&#8217;ll find the 87-minute film and its bonuses, worth watching.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",1386547200,2013-12-09

This was enjoyable for me the first season, the 2nd especially the superhero girls etc just started getting tired and over the top. I lump this in with SleepyHollow, cant even make it through the first season even though I already paid for it. I will say I am still watching revolution though and it keeps my interest.

1.0,"Definitely the worst TV show out there. Don't believe the reviews. I wanted to like this. It seemed like it would be absolutely amazing. I thought this show would be an accurate depiction of police back in the mid-19th century. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the black medical examiner working like Dexter trying to figure out how the girl died in the first episode. I had remembered what I had read about detective techniques in 1880's London. They basically did nothing that was shown on the show, and this takes place in the 1860's. Other things just made me roll my eyes. It reminded me of how lazy Detroit 187 was. They hired Michael Imperioli to play a detective in Detroit and even had him asking his coworkers if they wanted to get a slice. Facepalm! Seems the show was probably originally set in New Yawk and no one bothered to adjust the dialogue, or even try.Mercifully, I quit this show before they brought up anything about Shake Shack or Iphones. What a load of wasted potential.",1370390400,2013-06-05

4.0,"Having watched every season of the British hit ""Being Human,"" I was a bit wary of SyFy's American reinterpretation. After all, for every successful translation (The Office) of a British gem, there are dozens of failed attempts (Coupling). While I'm sure that I will anger the many avid fans of the original show, I will say that its first season (for me) was wildly uneven. I enjoyed the progress into later years as the plotting became darker and more complex--but while the show had an initial charm, it wasn't perfectly formed right out of the gate. So I was open-minded to this reboot. While some loyalists will contend that it is an utter failure and some newbies will proclaim it is brilliant, I fall squarely in the middle. Once again, I find myself thinking this is a good show with the potential to grow into something far richer and more rewarding. The British version started as an enjoyment and turned into great television. I think that the U.S. version has the same opportunity.For those new to the concept of ""Being Human,"" it is perhaps one of the most unique and (let's admit it) most ridiculous ones on TV. In its outrageousness, however, it is completely irresistible! What if a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire shared living quarters as best mates? You think the trials of tribulations of being young and attractive in the big city makes for great drama--try adding this supernatural component for a bit of fun. Sam Witwer has an intensity perfectly suited to the role of a tortured blood sucker. Sam Huntington has a goofy appeal as a befuddled werewolf. And Meaghan Rath is a serviceable and pleasant apparition. In my opinion, the cast between the two versions is on a relatively even playing field. I actually prefer Witwer in Season One, Rath is somewhat blander yet also less annoying, and Huntington (while incredibly likable) has a hard time measuring up Russell Tovey's pitch perfect creation. Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate Huntington's easy charm, but Tovey (with Sinead Keenan as Nina) give two of the most underrated performances on contemporary British TV.The premise of the show is that the three roomies crave normalcy above all else. But it's not an easy road. The first couple of episodes stick very firmly to the British template, but then the scripts branch out in a welcome way. Primary plot points in this season include Huntington's courtship of a new girlfriend, Rath's investigation into her untimely death, and Witwer's political struggle trying to extricate himself from a vampiric organization. Witwer's plot line has the most meat and is very well done. With terrific character pieces by Mark Pellegrino and Terry Kinney, this arc is the primary reason to catch this incarnation of ""Being Human."" The trio of leads plays off one another with ease, but have yet to develop the chemistry of their British counterparts. All in all, though, I think the show holds promise and the potential to grow. If you've never seen the original, I think that you'll have much to appreciate here--if for no other reason, the concept is so strikingly different. For fans of the original, I suppose a mixed reaction is to be expected--but I, for one, was willing to go with the flow and enjoy myself. KGHarris, 9/11.",1317168000,2011-09-28

4.0,"If you are on the hunt for a new thrilling and suspenceful horror flick, then IFC Midnight's latest release, Rites Of Spring, is the one for you. Written and directed by Padraig Reynolds, Rites Of Spring brings the thriller and horror genres together in perfect harmony. This film delivers on all cylinders with an exciting story line, a believable cast and tons-o-gore.While two stories are being intercut during this film, one being more of a thriller and the other a straight-up horror piece, Rites Of Spring delivers a perfect marrige between the two. With a creepy old farmer preying on young women in one, and a kidnapping that doesn't go as planned in the parallel tale, a great deal of mystery plays out in both.The cast found within this film are all lesser known/unknown actors who obviously have a passion for film. Anessa Ramsey delivers a spine-tingling performance as the character Rachel and after this film, she is destined to be called upon for many more horror roles in the future. From her line delivery to her trembling hands, Ramsey's screen presence is remarkable to say the least.As the film progresses, the blood begins to spill more and more. There are a few effects, that looked to be done with After Effects, that can be done without, but overall the look and realism of the gore is well above average. A round of applause must be give to the practical effects crew as well as the members of this production who came up with the look of the mysterious monster-like killer. This very scary and realistc looking crazy killer dons old rags and maggots as he brutely murders his victims.Rites Of Spring was a surprisingly fun and blood filled ride from begining to end.",1343347200,2012-07-27

4.0,"We are not sure of the source of the maddening of the young man forced to stay in his New York apartment. Are some internal propensities working themselves out in the claustrophobia of his situation? Is this a masculine version of Roman Polanski'sRepulsionin which Catherine Deneuve's character succumbs to a terrifying insanity within the confines of her apartment? Or is this more like ""The Exorcist"" in which some outside malevolence is relentlessly attacking its target? Or is it a little of both?The movie apparently intends to slant our interpretation in one particular way. This shows in its final scenes, but also in little clues planted along the way. What's that behind the would-be girlfriend as she stands in the middle of the room after getting something from the refrigerator? You see it in just the briefest flash.Either way, it's true that there are aspects of this movie that make for an uneasy mix. The protagonist's problems overtake him too fast, there are any number of loose ends, and some of the creepiness of bit players in this drama come off as being too obviously red herrings.However, ""Occupant"" anchors itself in reality, teaching something about the under-the-table machinations and distortions that are brought about by New York's system of rent control. Then as the protagonist spins off into a realm of the scarily unreal, Van Hansis delivers a chilling performance. He seems to incorporate the darkening around his eyes into his very being.Overall, ""Occupant"" became an absorbing black hole, drawing me into some other dimension of the human mind.",1356134400,2012-12-22

But I found it so engaging!  I'm really getting into all the backstories.  The characters are starting to develop.  I still feel like something is missing though.  There's a depth to the show that I just don't see yet.  But the potential is there.  These actors could do a LOT more than they're given now.  I hope the writing turns up as the season progresses.  I feel like it's moving in the right direction and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season.,1384905600,2013-11-20
2.0,"I think this series is the main cause of why my blood pressure is escalating whenever I pay attention to it. I was never fond of Police/Investigation/Crime shows except for a few here and there. My friend insisted this was a good show to watch and don't get me wrong for the first 5 or so episodes it was thrilling and engaging but it doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that the plots just keep dragging on and on and are quite repetitive. In short the fault doesn't lie with the actors but with the plot itself, it's ridiculous even for a TV show.Joe Carrol a former college professor, is well the villain the title ""The Following"" is based on his ability to reach out for those unloved/unwanted/outcast civilians who also suffer from a disease called psychopathy or otherwise known in today's pop culture Psycho. He more or less uses these people to form an organization that's going to follow his lead of serial murders, kidnappings, torture and all the inhuman activities ever invented to help him write the greatest novel alive which will be based on the real life of these murders. Not Only that he also chooses Ryan Hardy the former FBI agent who had an affair with Joe Carrol's ex wife and was the reason behind his capture a couple of years ago to be the patroness of this great work of literature that he's preparing. But that's not the point. The Point is the bad people are all intellects, sophisticated, dominating, sneaky and have a good strategy. While the good guys on the other hand, are hopeless and by hopeless I mean they can't do anything to save their lives and as a ramification of that the bad guys keep winning over and over while the good once lose everything.I just got bored, the endless killings of civilians in the name of this literally work while no one's able to catch them in the act is a tad unbelievable. The ability of Joe Carrol to brain wash as many people to join him in his little killing spree is just unrealistic and strange especially when we come to realize he was doing it while he was behind bars through the internet? Seriously! Come Join me in my quest of criminal activties and you'll get a chapter in my upcoming book! Yeah, no one will buy that!The minions are pathetic, losers who killed their (-------) and ran away with it cause the authorities are so dumb to catch them especially when they're already suspects entering a freaking Jail to visit a death row criminal who's responsible for the killing of 14 young girls. Did You get that? He's a mass murder and still gets unlimited jail visit times to interview his minions.Just, don't let me go any further I could go on and on and on about how stupid and impossible this situation would be in real life but I don't think my ramblings will end.Not to mention, he escapes prison again! and his followers fly him through a helicopter don't ask me how they afforded it unless they killed it's passengers to a huge mansion where he'll be crowned as their King. If this was happening in some medieval legend I might have bought that but in the real world in modern times with all this technology?I don't really know what the writers of this show are trying to portray by doing all of this? Is it for the sake of entertainment alone? Cause if it is let me tell you it's quite repetitive. Unless the writers have this hate for the FBI and just want to portray them as useless then fine. Whatever!I don't think I'll be watching the following season. What a waste of great potential!",1365552000,2013-04-10

With proper ways to investigate and going to real people's homes. Now they just look like abunch of bafoons. Jason never believed in everything they heard/saw, but now he cops to anything.

4.0,"Two years ago, A&E's Storage Wars came out of nowhere and quickly became one of the highest rated shows on cable. The show is extremely addictive and I watch it religiously, but why? Most people think it has something to with the mystery about what's behind the door or the hunt for buried treasure, as usual; I have a different take on things. The reason this show is as popular as is it, is the buyers themselves. Reality TV is about watching real people in real situations. We like to see people who are just like us, struggling to survive, fighting with co-workers, etc. The cast of Storage Wars are people that we can relate to and more than that, they are interesting as well. Every week I can't wait to see what Barry does, who Dave's gonna fight with, and what inappropriate thing Jarrod is going to say to his wife. I believe the show's popularity has little to do with what's behind the door. It's the unique and interesting cast that keeps us coming back for more. The truth is that it doesn't matter if it's storage auction buyers, repo-men, meter maids, or hand fisherman, what we want is people we like and can easily relate to in different situation both inside and out of the office, and Storage Wars provides that and then some.",1361491200,2013-02-22
4.0,This is a very timely show.  The kids are great role models. Innovators and makers. And having a girl challenge the status quo to join this group is a real plus.,1393286400,2014-02-25
5.0,"As my friends told me, the show would get better as it went along, and so far I have to agree.  The show is very well done, and there are several episodes that I thought were particularly entertaining (some good laughs).  The corpses sometimes are still very graphic, gross and disgusting, and sometimes things get a little too technical, but it is still an excellent show.This DVD set has several extras and it does have subtitles for the hearing impaired.  I hope the quality of the show continued in the other seasons, which I am looking forward to watching.  (I do not have cable or satellite, and only buy DVD's.)",1396137600,2014-03-30
5.0,"The pilot is as confusing for the audience as the recently passed apocalypse is for the characters; and for much the same reasons.  The power grid, cell phone reception and water distribution system are down, but vehicles and cell phones still have power and function.  There are large numbers of people about and the eight main characters remain together for no logical reason, but it is revealed that they all have the same birth day.  Also a point is made of displaying two characters' tattoos which link up to a ""creature"" with extensive tattooing of its own which incorporates the characters' tattoos.There is great room for development of the plot and characters as the pilot does little beyond setting up the situation and introducing the characters.  There seems to be a Biblical cant to the story, but it doesn't appear till late in the episode.  I'm eager to see more of this series just to see what the writers and producers have in mind.",1391817600,2014-02-08

5.0,"This is the &#34;Gunsmoke&#34; of the 21st Century:  Longmire is haunted by demons having lost his wife in mysterious circumstances and with a tenuous relationship with his daughter.  He is a man by himself to himself - troubled and good with a sense of purpose and honor.  His friendship with the local barkeep at times is wordless with a deep mutual understanding and respect.  He is silent in the face of unbearable antagonism with the local police at the reservation.  His sheriff office staff is loyal save one, a confused and handsome young man who takes umbrage to Longmire's ways and needs power to confirm his existence.  Longmire lets crime, personal struggles, relationships and professional challenges wash over him in silence, always moving, always trying to do the right thing to sometimes failure and sometimes success.  It is an excellent program using the surrounding wide and lonely Western landscape as a mirror for Longmire's character.  Because he holds so much inside, there is a quiet edge of your seat quality and intrigue - what will he do, what is he feeling that will motivate him to do it, how will others react?",1402790400,2014-06-15
5.0,"This is a very smart and funny show.  All the characters are likable and care about each other.  Great writing and super-talented cast.  And what can I say?  I'm a total sucker for good romantic comedy writing.  Mindy Kaling is probably the best writer of our generation in this genre.  She wrote for Jim and Pam on The Office and does an even better job on her own show. I wish she could write for Nick and Jess on New Girl, but that's a whole other story.",1389657600,2014-01-14

5.0,I chose this show because it was something I thought would be easy to watch and fun. I can say it is both of those but it also makes me feel good as it is very cleverly done with great acting and just one of those shows you find yourself addicted to. The stars are perfect for the roles they play and I can't see anyone else playing the characters. Perfect casting!! Love it and them!!,1386979200,2013-12-14

5.0,"While I gave this series five stars, streaming through Amazon Prime didn't fare so well. There were frequent interruptions including several that suggested that I contact Amazon to deal with the problem. I did this only to find a neat list of possible solutions. These solutions were only relevant to problems caused by my 'smart' TV, other equipment and/or steaming service. I gave up midway though one episode and will try again by streaming via HDMI cable from my desktop....",1401840000,2014-06-04

Let Brian Unger lead you around this wonderful nation of ours and you will discover two things that shaped the states: 1) Water...or the lack of it. 2) Money...and a willingness to share it with some esteemed lawmakers in Washington, D.C.Unger takes us from coast to coast and border to border; he discovers the often seamy goings on that gave our states their individual shapes. He interviews the citizens, drives the highways, rows on the lakes and eats lots of barbecue! He discovers that there are little islands of rebels who have declared their independence from this great land of ours, and they are only partially kidding!Colorful, scenic, interesting and entertaining, this fascinating DVD from Amazon.com is a painless way to get a little more insight into how this amazing nation grew.",1325548800,2012-01-03

3.0,I am starting to find these type reality shows a little depressing.  A person grows up being indoctrinated on the &#34;American Dream&#34; only to see these people who have supposedly achieved it settling for the worst examples of success and what it is to have &#34;friends&#34; that I have ever witnessed.  If this is what one can expect friends who needs any?  Genre is becoming depressing.,1395705600,2014-03-25

1.0,"Out of all of the new shows that debuted on Amazon pilot series, this was the worst. It was slow, way too cliche (underline, underline), boring plot, annoying sex scenes, cursing where it doesn't belong. No likable characters except for both of the maestros.

Of course things were not nearly as exciting back then as the adventures in the story!  To some extent, to appreciate such fantasy one must be willing to engage a willing suspension of disbelief.

The characters are different...classically trained musicians and those trying to break into the business.  As a musician I found it interesting and fun to watch although at times over the top.  It does underscore the politics in the music business.  The music business eats it young.  As I said, I enjoyed it and I hope they go beyond the pilot.",1394755200,2014-03-14
3.0,"The show is entertaining, does not bring new story but i still see it is little bit more &#34;realistic!&#34; than (Heroes) and this thing only for first season of (Alphas). The story of group of super powered members headed by a regular person already was presented in (Mutant-X). It is an amazing show for those who like the concept of super heroes. There are few new elements in this show though and that will make you enjoy it.",1384387200,2013-11-14

4.0,"OK, the first thing you need to know about Lillyhammer is that it was produced for Norwegian NetworkTV.....not an American audience (although it translates well). Ignore the silly comments about &#34;nosubtitles&#34;....they are right here on the stream just like they are right there on Netflix if you have thatservice, as they are on the DVD.The story is very simple, Frankie the Fixer rolls over on his mob boss, is offered his choice of placesto relocate and fixes on Lillehammer (because he saw it on the Olympics and thought it was cool). Oncehe arrives, he soon finds out things are done differently in Norway, and the show is basically about howFrankie (now Giovanni/Johnny) figures out his own solutions to the daily obstacles of life in Norway thatare constantly being tossed in his way. For example, he finds from the local constable that his driverslicense is invalid and left to walk back to town only to be told by the local DMV that it takes 6 months toget a license in Norway. But as usual, a solution presents itself to the ever vigilant and opportunisticGiovanni!If you've seen the Sopranos, then you've seen the character being portrayed here by Steve Van Zandt,probably with a little more charm and a little less &#34;stugatz&#34; than on Sopranos. But thats where anycomparison ends. This show is funny, there is intrigue, romance, adventure, JR Ewing style wheelingand dealing, and a rare and accessible view into a culture that is in many ways similar to ours, but aworld apart in reality. 4.5 StarsBTW, Netflix just announced the show has been picked up for Season 3, a testament to the popularityof this terrific series! (8 episodes per season)",1389744000,2014-01-15

5.0,"I'd back this project without a doubt.  My one observation is that I preferred the traditional two dimensional backgrounds verse the full rendered CGI environments.  The CGI scenes just seemed to have too much stuff in them to be really appreciated by anyone; adult or child.I like the voice acting, the basic plot of the main character discovering nature and physics via his attempts at play, but I'm not too keen on the character design.  Yet the character design is just my personal choice.  If it were me, I might make Fig more fox-like.  Maybe bring his eyes a little closer together by just a scoch.Otherwise it really is delightful.  Good children's material.  Excellent stuff.",1366675200,2013-04-23

4.0,"Watched the pilot episode. The Last Ship kicked off to a promising start and was engaging. The question, however, is whether it dissolves into a predictable human drama devoid of scientific and military realism. No, the crew would not mutiny; no, you cannot develop a vaccine in 48 hours.The most recent failure that jumps to mind is &#34;Last Resort&#34; (the story of a ballistic submarine given highly suspect orders to fire their nukes). The initial kick-off was tense and exciting but it rapidly deteriorated into a farce in which the captain rarely took decisive and appropriate action, and in which the crew was continuously flirting with mutiny. It just wasn't believable at any level.So I keep my fingers crossed this drama does not share the same fate. A good story that does not meander aimlessly is the key here!",1404691200,2014-07-07

4.0,"this was the last of this show. it must have been intended to go for at least one more because it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger which is going to leave some viewers unsatisfied.  however, if you are watching this for the purpose of the drama, i.e. the beginning of broadcast news and the the people who got it off the ground in the UK, you won't be dissatisfied at all.  this time the news team goes after a blackmail scheme used by a club owner which has put politicians and police chiefs in his pocket throughout London. as background, the people at this time are obsessing about the nuclear arms race and fearing that they will be nuked.  i think the second series was stronger than the first one but maybe just a little bit too much hokey romance angle. the best part was anchorman hector and his wife marine.  hector begins to self destruct and their marriage starts to fall apart.  Oona Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter, who strongly resembles him, almost steals the show as marine. peter capaldi as head of the news division does a marvelous acting job as well.all in all i enjoyed the show but it did fall short of being MAD MEN, which it was trying to achieve from the outset.",1385856000,2013-12-01

3.0,"I love DP, but I thought that this episode illustrated how bad information can lead to unnecessary problems for individuals.  The last segment about magnetic pole shift is a common misperception.  There is currently magnetic pole drift.  This is a fact known especially to pilots who witnessed a recent 10 degree change in runway designations.  This drift is occurring at about 40 miles a year and is West to slightly Southwest.  At the current rate of drift, there is no possibility of the scenario which the last family imagined.  Moreover, even if the unlikely event of a complete sudden magnetic pole shift (the south pole becoming the north pole and vice versa), the axis of the planet would not change.  For the axis to change, the best likely culprit would be a large external force hitting the planet.  In that case, no one anywhere on planet Earth would stand a chance no matter how prepared they were for doomsday.",1342224000,2012-07-14
5.0,"British television does a lot of very good work, but sometimes, the various British accents are difficult to comprehend.  This miniseries started out slow, and the relationship between the main protagonists was a bit tough to warm up to.  As the series progressed, the plot lines took shape, and the story became compelling.The background, in 1956, was a period when I was just growing much more aware of the world, and news of conflicts around the world became very real, and scary.  I don't know how that aspect of the story will relate with younger viewers, but for me, it brought back the memories of nuclear bomb safety drills in school.Once into this miniseries, it becomes a binge watching lost day.",1400284800,2014-05-17

He was FANTASTIC (hehe) definitely a warrior, but with a soft spot just big enough for Rose Tyler to enter.  After his regeneration into #10 (Tennant) you see the warrior remain, but with more of a loving side.  Tennant's range of emotion, his depiction of a complex character who must travel alone, but longs for companionship - is just hands down incredible.  I don't think there was one episode where I didn't wind up tearing a little by episodes end.  You gotta love a Time Lord with a passionate love for humanity.

3.0,"I'm on the fence on whether or not I'll get another season. But I liked it enough to where I will keep it.  (If I don't like a DVD I purchased, I send it on to friends who might.)  I would actually rate it 3 1/2.  A little violent, but not quite as bad as other shows I've seen.",1378598400,2013-09-08
5.0,I really enjoyed this movie.  Dame Judi Dench is one of my favorite movie stars.  She is fantastic in all of her movies and she always picks the movie she wishes to be in as an actor.,1386201600,2013-12-05
5.0,"Stephen Colbert is always witty, insightful and wonderfully ironic. His right-wing character (of the same name) is so perfectly developed and honed that he makes his points effortlessly, humorously, brilliantly. Love the show. Just wish Amazon Prime offered the episodes immediately instead of making members wait as long as 5 days past their delivery date.

3.0,"The Originals were great in The Vampire Diaries.But as a standalone show?  Not so much.  Why?  Because of Klaus and Elijay mainly.  While superbly acted, the characters are written to be too one dimensional.  They become caricatures of themselves - Klaus the psycho killer and Elijay the dapper brother.  Pizza is great.  But pizza all day, everyday is too much.The other thing is the &#34;family&#34; theme that gets pounded into the viewers' head constantly.  We get it.  Ease up ok?  I know this is supposed to be a more adult story and they obviously can't go with teen angst but the family theme just seems forced.Lastly, the actor that plays Marcellus has an annoying squint in his eyes and a half smile all the time that is incredibly annoying to watch.  It's like watching Gilbert Gotfried.  And Gilbert Gotfried is annoying.",1404000000,2014-06-29
4.0,I was very young when this show was aired on television.  Now I can appreciate the humor and the cleaner programs of that era.  Not quite as funny as some of the other programs of that day; but you'll still get a laugh.,1379030400,2013-09-13

4.0,This season's writers and the regular actors continue to produce exciting and engaging stories and roles to yield another interesting season.

2.0,"They've tried to add more danger, intrigue and heat (suspense and romance) into the show.  I had settled into and was enjoying how it WAS and the change is a little off-putting to me.  Some people might like it better, actually.",1365033600,2013-04-04
2.0,When I saw the start of this once entertaining series it was exciting and entertaining but the last two seasons have become sadly the weakest for this once entertaining series. I still find the cast enjoyable and some of the episodes and action is still decent but the plot and finale for the final season was the most weakest written from the writers of the series and sadly left me with more annoyance on the series ending then any sort of satisfaction.I understand the writers and producers felt the need to wrap up the last season quickly but that has become their fault on making this season the least liked out of the entire series run.So if you already have the previous seasons I say stick with those and just forget the seventh and sadly least entertaining season you won't be missing much.,1386374400,2013-12-07

It promotes forward thinking IMO.This series started out with a cool idea, of ""what if"".With Stephen King as the writer, and Steven Spielberg as the director, WOW, I was excited.Ouch. Ouch.  Arggh! This show is SO bad.If Steven Spielberg is REALLY directing this- he should be arrested, and then sent home with a monitoring device. Or, he should see his doctor to find out what is wrong with him.*No, I'm no wannabe writer- I'm a ticked off viewer!How the heck do these two entertainment giants, let such a BAD show air, with their names?There, will no longer be any... Oh, if Spielberg is directing ""I've got to see it"" in our family. Or, ""If Stephen King wrote it"", I should order it.  NOPE.For US. This is a TOTAL Sell-out from both of you.

3.0,"Hard to rate such an open-ended story after just one episode, but I would have watched more if they were available. I liked the premise and I liked the characters. The acting was solid, but no way to tell this early whether the writers will lose their way with the story (e.g. Lost). Also, if you're going to use adult language you need to use adult violence. Plenty of us have seen the real deal. You can't have people driving vehicles through crowds of people and shotgun fire-fights without carnage.",1393286400,2014-02-25

3.0,This is the most socking and disappointing of the Bones seasons. The short duration because of the writers strike (don&#8217;t they realize the effects of their strike ripple through the years to create animosity?). This caused some short cuts in the plot points of the season. One of the episodes from Season 2 appears in season 3 and it feels horribly out of place.

2.0,"&#34;Animal&#34; is Chiller TV's latest in SyFy-esque rip-offs, although this one lacks the humor and WTF moments SyFy's do.  I group of teens go for a stroll in the forest and come across an &#34;animal&#34; (similarly looking to the creatures found in &#34;Feast&#34;).  The race for survival is on.  What happens next is why the film just missed its target.  Bad writing dooms this creature feature from the first encounter with the beast.  Every person involved makes every wrong decision you can imagine, but I supposed the filmmakers had to have a reason to get in some carnage.&#34;Animal&#34; isn't a good movie and it's really not that bad of a movie.  The screenplay (or lack thereof) dooms it.  I cannot recommend it, but I'm not going to say stay away either.  Believe me, Chiller TV has come leaps and bounds from its first film, the nasty &#34;Ghoul&#34;.  This version is unrated for violence and language.",1405900800,2014-07-21

3.0,"The actors are great. The places and culture are absorbing, compelling. The first half of the mystery is gripping, you can't wait for the next episode, and these people are masters of the end-of-episode cliff hanger. However, about half way through the season the dramatic reveal becomes common, almost boring, and the story become a bit cliche. By the end of the season I was fast forwarding through parts, just to get to the end. I won't bother with season 2.It's a shame. The season started  with a rush, but ended with a...&#34;eh.&#34;",1388880000,2014-01-05

I was so drawn in after the first episode (thanks Amazon for the free download) that I just had to keep watching to see where the show would go.  I'm intrigued by the slightly contemporary setting, it makes things more interesting and doesn't detract from the show at all.  Can't wait for more.",1364774400,2013-04-01

4.0,"I loved this steampunk movie A LOT (a lot better in the theatrical version!). Usually the DIRECTOR'S CUT imprint means a longer or more violent version. Not so here. The director chose to REMOVE (CUT) 10 minutes of the theatrical version - story and rather important scenes (nothing that will make the movie incomprehensible though). On this blu-ray I EXPECTED the choice between the theatrical version and the ""Director's Cut"", but no, we only get the Director's cut, so I took 1 star OFF the rating.I LOVED this movie in its theatrical form. It is still great in this form, but if you've seen the longer version you will definitely MISS some scenes!On blu-ray, why not give us the CHOICE between both versions - or sell them BOTH seprately at least? The theatrical version is NOT available at all in the US to my knowledge.Besides this issue, I really liked MUTANT CHRONICLES a lot. It is very dark and the story is very interesting with some new ideas. Great actors (including Ron Pearlman, Tom Jane, Devon Aoki, Benno Fuhrmann and a cameo by John Malkovich and, last but not leat, a great performance by Sean Pertwee).",1390867200,2014-01-28

This led to an interest in shows and books I wouldn't have touched earlier. This show takes the people on the cutting edge of science and tops in their field and presents their ideas in laymen terms as much as possible. Since I am definitely a layman I appreciate this very much. I am looking forward to season 3 :-)!,1347667200,2012-09-15

1.0,"This could easily be one of those lampoons done by the Scary Movie franchise  My favorite scene was the female officer hanging on to back of the getaway ambulance.  What was she doing back there?  She was spread eagled on the back bumper with hardly a hand hold.  Was this supposed to be a dramatic act of heroics?  It looked like the rest of the group wouldn't let her ride inside because she was a minority.  Never-the-less, she seemed grateful to be allowed to ride on the back bumper and helplessly hang on for dear life as the ambulance sped through the city.Eventually, they make it out of the city after being chased by an angry mob and find refuge in the old lady's mansion, whereupon it only seems appropriate that the sexy babe character would strip entirely naked and go swimming  in the pool, because you see, they are all in the middle of an obvious crisis situation, and that's what would happen in the Scary Movie franchise.",1392595200,2014-02-17

Meanwhile there is an umbrella killing happening in the Vatican as two Guido Sarducci wannabes head to New Orleans.The film is a generic spoof of horror films, lacking the good satire we have come to expect from the ""Scary Movie"" series. Much of the humor is overly slapstick while other humor is just downright stupid. ""Hell Baby"" is classified as a comedy horror without horror and needing quality comedy. The film had some good lines and a few good scenes, but unfortunately they couldn't maintain it. The police officers in the movie were a lame attempt at humor. The baby doesn't enter the film until it is nearly over and is insignificant to the production.The film will work as a low brow rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, full frontal nudity (Riki Lindhome)",1383868800,2013-11-08

The couple were drifting apart when Kathleen came up missing.The plot was pretty suspenseful. I knew nothing of the &#34;true story&#34; behind it until after I watched, but it did start taking a dark turn pretty quickly and the gore level was minimal. I don't remember seeing anything that made me even remotely squeamish. A great deal of it is done by implying.Before watching &#34;All Good Things&#34; I would have seriously doubted Ryan Gosling's ability to play anything sinister.

5.0,"If you look hard enough, you can find truly great mysteries across the variety of film genres.  They've long been the province of historical fiction or period pieces looking back at some treacherous point in history.  Thrillers often wrap up one or several enigmas within their dark, elusive characters.  Science fiction tackles them by revealing the world hidden beneath.  Character dramas - much like director Daniel Nettheim's THE HUNTER - occasionally scramble to place the pieces amongst the various players and subplots, but this effortless adaptation based on Julia Leigh's novel of the same name could serve as a textbook example of how to do it and do it well.Martin David (played by screen veteran Willem Dafoe) is a mercenary, using his unique set of skills to benefit corporations seeking elusive genetic material.  Contacted by the mysterious Red Leaf Company, he's hired to secure a `sample' of the neurotoxin contained in the venom of the Tasmanian Tiger.  The problem?  The tiger is long thought to have been extinct.  However, as fate would have it, rare sightings have stretched across the Tasmanian wild.  Once David travels to Tasmania posing as a university scientist investigating the rumors, he uncovers what may be several conspiracies, all pointing toward a single truth he may not be willing to accept.THE HUNTER is a gem of a movie, one part thriller, one part mystery, one part very soft sci-fi, and definitely two parts noir.  Dafoe's tight-lipped craftsman lives his existence sterilely; in his home at the beginning, we're shown his immaculately white counters with his toiletries lain out with specific precision.  Suddenly, he's thrust into a dirty, broken-down farmhouse where a despondent widow, Lucy Armstrong (Frances O'Connor), languishes her days doped up in bed while her two young children (Morgana Davies and Finn Woodlock) eek out their day-to-day existence with little to no parental guidance.  Out of necessity, the loner forces himself into the role as a surrogate `adult,' and, as he grows more attached to the three of them, he learns that they all may be on a same dangerous path when the forces of nature and industrial espionage collide.The performances are all exceptional.  Dafoe long ago mastered the grim, brooding outsider in the days of Oliver Stone's PLATOON, and it's matured nicely here.  His dogged determination to uncover the truth is matched by his commitment as a predator in pursuit of his prey, and he carries the weight of the tale here with great effectiveness.  Another veteran, Sam Neill, appears as a local tracker named Jack Mindy, and, while his involvement in possible earlier searches for the tiger is never made perfectly clear, the actor gets solid mileage out of his several scenes.  O'Connor as the broken widow moves easily between her various influences - mother, possible love interest, new-age mystic - and her ability to wear several hats serves the story greatly.  The story never quite establishes what drove her to the polar opposites of her performance (`participant' versus `pawn' versus `victim'), and she straddles that ambiguity in a way that keeps the viewer guessing.Though there are a few narrative `hiccups' that could've been ironed out to greater clarity (i.e. the true relationship of Jack Mindy to the Red Leaf; a better understanding of Lucy Armstrong's real motivation with Martin David; how much to the children know about their father's disappearance; etc.), they pale in comparison to the modestly layered and driven story at the heart of THE HUNTER.  There's an awful lot going on here - from corporate shenanigans to double-crosses, from jaded intimacy to concerns over ecology - but the script balances it all exceedingly well.  There are several mysteries at play- each of them keeping Dafoe's David questioning the ruggedness of the physical and emotional terrain - and they all serve to keep the viewer's interest, all the way up until our hero grapples with his last, fateful decision and the consequences it'll unleash: to do the unthinkable and live with the consequences OR to embrace his newly uncovered humanity and live with THOSE consequences instead.THE HUNTER is produced by Magnolia Pictures and Screen Australia in association with Screen NSW, Screen Tasmania, Fulcrum Media Finance, Madman Entertainment, and Entertainment One.  DVD distribution is being handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment.  The picture looks and sounds wonderful; the director of photography Robert Humphreys has captured some magnificent vistas in the Tasmanian wild, as well as some sacred, dark corners of the countryside rumored (in the film) to hold the last of its kind tiger.  Special features include a `making of' featurette, deleted scenes (with commentary), a commentary track for the picture, and the theatrical trailer; it's a terrific collection to match the investment of story and characters here.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.  I always knew that the face of the man dispatched to kill of last of any living species would have to be one that looked like Willem Dafoe, and THE HUNTER confirms my long held suspicion; but it does so in a way that surprises the viewer by presenting the cold, cunning, and calculating killer as a patient yet troubled soul almost desperate to hide his own fragile humanity trapped beneath that ragged, leathery exterior.  Step by step, THE HUNTER is forced to see the world around him for what it is - precious, with some secrets worthy of being kept - and that may mean accepting the stark reality: be willing to become the prey instead of always serving as mankind's gifted predator.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Magnolia Home Entertainment provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE HUNTER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1340755200,2012-06-27

4.0,"George and his fellow bad members pick up small gigs at night, while working at the asylum during the day. As cooks fot the criminaly insane, it is their job to prepare and serve the food for the inmates. With a less than ideal job, the group is hoping to make it big sometime soon and leave the asylum for good. Unfortunatly for them, the inmates have other ideas.As a giant thunderstorm rolls through the town, the power at the asylum goes out. The lights don't turn on, the security doors are useless and the phones are dead. Reluctant at first, the cooks decide to restore order and bring the wandering inmates back to their cells. George and his friends soon realize the inmates my be insane, but they are not stupid. With an almost methodical plan of attack, the prisoners slowly begin to take over the darkened asylum. Armed with whatever they can find, the criminaly insane hunt down the gaurds and cooks, all while inflicting some serious pain.The overall production was seemless. The cimematography is absolutely top notch as not one frame from this film is out of place. The picture perfect lighting and color tone found within this film emphasizes the detail and dedication that went into this production. The acting is seriously some of the best to come from a low budget film in a long time. Rupert Evans, the actor playing George, is the dominate acting force in the movie. His performance was is true, beleivalbe and without hesitation. Be on the look out for more from Evans.IFC Midnight comes through big time with their release of Asylum Blackout. Director Alexandre Courtes delivers the scares and the gore in new and inventive ways. The blood is plentyful and the deaths are to die for. Along with the great direction, the superb camera work and acting ensures this 2012 horror/thriller hits on all cylinders.",1342569600,2012-07-18

4.0,"Essentially a romance, as Raymond Chandler would put it: that is a fantasy rather than an attempt to capture the reality of a life situation. His Marlowe, he said, and the situations in which he participated were an attempt at fictional creation not the way life really is. This is a good and entertaining show, at least in this first season, in which never to be found in real life characters, provide an unreal world of drama and comedy, of people who pique our interest through  the unreal things they do, which to us, for the brief time in which they are  on-tv-stage, may seem very real. The star would be very obnoxious (in the part she plays, that is) if one had to deal with her in real life; in a fiction she is made to seem quite human and appealing--with foibles. At this stage of development in the show (I've seen nothing of the other seasons) the star is carrying the show surrounded by some well-played and potentially interesting supporting players.I liked it with qualifications based on my more than occasional irritation with the Star. I think that people who like a show that does not seek to tell it as it is, will be appealing to many in the audience. It is certainly worth a try.",1381881600,2013-10-16

5.0,"Far from going downhill, I think HOUSE made some difficult choices in its melange of characters and those choices were correct to make.  First and foremost, Cameron and Chase were weak characters played by weak actors.  They have been all but completely pushed off the show and they should be.  They have been replaced by much stronger actors, especially the incredibly strong actors Peter Jacobson and Kal Penn as supporting doctors. The already strong characters (played by strong actors) of Foreman, Cuddy and Wilson remain, with bolder roles than ever.  Of course, they are all dominated and eclipsed by Hugh Laurie as HOUSE himself.  For anyone who has been living in a cave without a tv for the last 5 years, HOUSE is a series tv show about one of the top internists in the world who correctly diagnoses just about every freak medical condition which exists.  He is played by British actor Hugh Laurie who is incredibly convincing as an American.  I watched Hugh Laurie on British tv in his earlier shows, especially with Stephen Fry, and HOUSE is as opposite a role from those as one could imagine. HOUSE functions like the modern day incarnation of Arthur Conan Doyle's twin inspirations, his medical mentor and professor, Dr. Joseph Bell, also a premier diagnostician, plus his literary creation, detective Sherlock Holmes. HOUSE has all the same off putting social characteristics as Holmes plus he is likewise musical and a drug addict (pain killers).  Wilson, the oncologist in the same hospital, is as close to a Watson as HOUSE can find.  He is the only one who long term puts up with HOUSE as a friend.  There are lots of surprises in this season which I cannot mention because they would be terrible spoilers.  I will say the ending this time is the very best one the show has ever done and is totally fitting for the way the character HOUSE has been developed.  I am waiting eagerly for season 6.",1248566400,2009-07-26

5.0,"This series is well worth the time invested in watching Charles Dickens' classic unfold.  I never understood it so well reading it in High school. Until I saw this version, which is so well acted, the incredibly complex characters of Dickens world do truly come to life.  There is so much merit in the many messages projected in this series from what brings real happiness in life to who is a real debtor, to what constitutes a good and noble person.  I will watch this series again and again, as there is so much wisdom and insight to gain from seeing it over and over.At first the different English and French accents may be hard to follow, as we are not so accustomed to hearing these dialects but with patience it becomes clearer and more easily understandable.  Well worth the time and patience.",1360540800,2013-02-11

3.0,"In all honesty I didn't know what I was getting myself into with this British film directed by Ben Wheatley.  I almost pulled the plug as the first act seemed to drone on endlessly with no point.  In addition, although I'm no newcomer to various English accents coming out of the U. K., no matter how loud I turned up the sound, I couldn't comprehend what half the words were.  So my fellow Americans, my advice is go ahead and put on the English subtitles, shift gears and hang on for one of the most head-scratching films you'll see.The movie evolves from a domestic squabble between Shel (MyAnna Buring), a former Swedish soldier and Jay (Neil Maskell), a temporarily unemployed killer-for-hire.  After a job went south in Russia, Jay's nerves are a bit shaky but his partner in crime, Gal (Michael Smiley), convinces him it's time to get back in the game.  They do and their targets are focused on a priest and likely pedophile and a porn distributor.At this stage we're not too concerned about their fate.  They deserve what they get.  Yet something is amiss.  They thank Jay before their demise.  Events become more and more unsettling as their search for their targets drives them into areas they (and I) didn't see coming.  The occult and Satanism show their faces.  As the movie shifts into high gear, it also changes tone, now entering some scary and gory horror.  And Wheatley and his writing partner, Amy Jump, don't pull their punches.  I'm still trying to figure out what I just saw.  I suspect you might too.",1361577600,2013-02-23

3.0,"Quentin Dupieux's RUBBER is many things: existential horror comedy, commentary on the filmmaker/audience relationship, obscure dream-like ode to non-sequiturs.  It's a rather straightforward story--tire malevolently comes to life, ignorantly (perhaps) kills everything in its path--framed by a Greek-like movie-watching chorus and a wise-cracking, fourth-wall-breaking sheriff (who encourages one of his deputies to shoot him to prove that nothing is real).  And, as you may expect, none of it really makes sense.The acting is solid, but ultimately inconsequential--which is perhaps the film's biggest flaw.  When your star is a mute piece of rubber, you need solid directing and interesting visuals to keep the audience's attention.  Initially, Dupieux delivers; the open scene is beautifully orchestrated, and there are other killer (pun intended) scenes as well.  But it doesn't really add up.  Which is largely Dupieux's point, of course; he's making a statement here.  The problem is, his message doesn't come across too clear.  RUBBER is worth a watch for fans of off-kilter comedy, or anyone interested in the philosophy of film-making, but it isn't a movie for everyone.  If the title of this review (quoted from that marvelous opening scene) appeals to the film aesthete in you, then this movie is definitely up your alley.  If it seems like nonsense...best look elsewhere.",1309910400,2011-07-06

4.0,"""Doomsday Preppers"" is a TV series shown on National Geographic Channel, featuring survivalists or ""preppers"". I've only seen a few episodes of the first season, but so far the people interviewed seem more rational than the characters shown in season two.For starters, these survivalists are usually preparing for a worldwide economic collapse, an event which probably will happen (although one can discuss how, when and how fast). The idea that China will pull the debt plug on the United States sounds unrealistic, while the general fears about a debt-ridden economy are well-grounded. Add peak oil to the dish, and...well, you get the picture. Even the disabled guy who preps for solar flares wiping out all electricity on Earth isn't completely irrational - apparently, a major EMP event *could* happen, although experts generally feel that it might be another 500 years until next time...The preppers in this season also seem better prepared than the hopefully scripted crazies in the second round. One of them is an elite soldier who trains his own militia group. Another is a ""soccer mom"" who tries to create an entire community network around her prepping, self-defence classes and surprisingly delicious stashed food. Elementary weapons training, growing your own food and stashing products for barter are other clever options.All in all, I would say that some of the episodes of this season (""I hope I am crazy"", ""Into the spider hole"", etc) might give you a good look at the U.S. prepper subculture. The second season is more of a freak show, Jerry Springer style. But sure, if that entertains you...",1357430400,2013-01-06

2.0,"Thylacinus cynocephalus aka Tasmanian tiger went extinct in Aussie land, Tasmania and NZ in the early 1900s and despite rewards of millions up until quite recently, there have been only a few unconfirmed sightings.This movie is taken from a novel by the same name. Unfortunately, the characterizations seemed like someone decided to toss a bunch of popular stereotypes into a bag, give it a good toss, and see what story comes out of it.The stereotypic loner assassin with high tech sniper rifle is hired by the usual big bucks pharmaceutical company to kill off the last Thylacinus but not before getting blood and tissue samples so said company can be the sole maker of a resulting super drug. Not believable.Stereotype of ""greenies"" protecting old growth forests against the loggers. Pointless subplot.Stereotype of townspeople in bar showing in your face distrust of a foreigner, in this case the assassin. Not believable.One of the townspeople happens, coincidentally, to have a similar sniper rifle and tries to kill the assassin. Also not believable.Assassin lodges in the home of a researcher, who has gone missing for months. Home is occupied by a depressed wife who can't get out of bed for months while her two very young children take care of everything. Not believable and another plot digression.Sam Neill plays a part time guide along with other roles in the movie that just seemed contrived. Pointless subplot.No flow to the storyline, just a bunch of cutout stereotypes. The only acting worth noting was by Morgana Davies whose naturalness made her character believable. Similar to her performance in ""The Tree"". So far she's hasn't been influenced by the ""Rubber Stamp Acting School"" or become a perennial stuck-in-a-rut actor.",1341792000,2012-07-09

This season, while staying with the same spirit as the previous two, has a better plot in terms of the business of advertizing, but disappoints a little in relationship content.

2.0,"Yet another fantasy produced by Jews (Sherri Rufh, Sam Berliner, Barry Levinson, et al) that prominently feature a black expert, in this case, forensics. Since we know that none such existed in the 1800's, the intentional but subtle brainwashing message here is that there would have been if not for the cruel, ignorant bigoted white society that prevented it, for which we should feel guilty and make atonement. Have you figured that out yet? And in productions that are present-day, it's the message that blacks are fit to rule over us and we should submit to them (when in reality they serve as fronts for Jewish political power). But please explain why in real life there are virtually no black physicists, black philosphers, black mathematicians, black brain surgeons, black rocket scientists, black engineers...heck, there are hardly any black auto mechanics! Could it have anything to do with the fact that where whites have an average IQ of 100, for black Africans it's 70, and for black americans (with most of them having some admixture of white), its only 85? Only in Jewish-produced film and TV are we constantly barraged with this propaganda. Even Barack Obama is only half-black, is of average intelligence (at best), was a failure at Occidental and only got into Columbia because he did so as a foreign exchange student from Malaysia, AND he's purely a media-creature paid for by Goldman-Sachs (again, Jewish).",1377475200,2013-08-26

3.0,"&#34;Zero Charisma&#34; was a crowdsourced film, presumably by geeks who long to see a role-playing game true to the spirit of gamers everywhere. The good news is that &#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; gets a lot of things right.  The bad news is it gets so many things right that there are several plot threads that are never really resolved that make for an unsatisfying ending.Scott Weidemeyer (Sam Eidson) is the old school game master everyone loves to hate.  If you've ever played Dungeons & Dragons, you know him well: the DM who house rules everything, argues on message boards, gets thrown out of hobby stores, and rules over his players with an iron fist. Scott's not particularly lucky with the ladies, but he&#8217;s got a place to game (his grandmother&#8217;s house) and he&#8217;s not afraid to use it.The players around the table are all gaming archetypes: the hopeless nerd, the aspiring creative types, the guy with a family who is constantly battling with his spouse over his game time. When that player realizes that it&#8217;s the game or his spouse, he gives up the game.  Worse, Scott's mom has returned and has plans to take over his grandmother&#8217;s house and move her into a home. Scott's sweet gaming pad is about to disappear. Reality, in essence, comes crashing into the long-standing fantasy world Scott has so meticulously created.Thus begins a quest to find a new player.  This is no easy feat, and there are plenty of opportunities to sneer at younger generations of players who came to D&D; fantasy tropes by way of World of Warcraft.  In the end, it&#8217;s a different archetype that finds his way into the gaming group: the hipster douche in the form of Miles (Garrett Graham).This new breed of gamer has a successful career in a creative field, runs a popular blog, has a hot girlfriend, and treats D&D; like a fun past time the same way other people treat a card game.  He doesn&#8217;t take it too seriously.Mile's acceptance in the group soon overshadows Scott, who inevitably finds himself compared to someone with much higher Charisma&#8230;and failing the opposed roll.  Miles is everything Scott is not, and it&#8217;s not long before this rift comes to a head that involves a Gary Gygax stand-in, a philosophical argument over the purpose of playing role-playing games, and a lot of heavy metal.The problem with &#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; is that because of how it was edited, it shambles unevenly along. Considerable attention is paid to glances from Mile's girlfriend, who at one point appears to be flirting with our anti-hero. This plot point goes nowhere, despite the camera frequently zooming in on her expressions.  There's also a lot of emphasis on people filming the climactic battle between Miles and Scott that again, goes nowhere.The climax, which takes place at Miles' party, is meant to reveal the true douchery by showing that while Miles is happy to game with the nerds, he doesn&#8217;t really consider them friends.  This isn&#8217;t really so much said as implied, as not all the other players are invited to the party.  It begs the question though: so what? Is it really that big a deal if Miles doesn&#8217;t invite people to hang out socially? Additionally, the rest of the players never find out they weren&#8217;t invited.  What should be a climactic emotional showdown becomes something of a slap fight.Like the film &#8220;Napoleon Dynamite,&#8221; &#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; asks what kind of happy ending can there possibly be for the mistfits of the world.  Unlike that film, &#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; has an answer and it&#8217;s not particularly satisfying. Instead of growing as a person, Miles keeps the game the same and just changes out the players.&#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; is a fun film for gamers, but it could be so much more. In the end our hero only raises his Charisma a point or two.",1405209600,2014-07-13
5.0,"The first two seasons of 30 ROCK the series managed to accumulate every imaginable award, not merely Golden Globes and Emmys, but the highly prestigious Peabody.  TV Critics proclaimed it one of the greatest comedy series in TV history.  Despite all this, no one was watching the series.  NBC renewed it twice simply because it was far and away its most critically acclaimed show.  And as I said, it had a shelf full of awards to prove it.  In accepting the show's first Emmy show creator Tina Fey summed it up perfectly:  ""I'd like to thank our dozens and dozens of viewers.""Then came the 2008 election and John McCain chose as his running mate a photogenic but outrageously under qualified governor from Alaska.  She was a comically awful choice, but for a while not everyone realized that.  Then on Saturday Night Live Tina Fey returned to portray Sarah Palin.  Her impersonation devastated Palin's public perception and more or less destroyed her political career.  It helped that many of the most hilarious things that she said were incredibly close to what Palin actually said.  While her impersonation was not crucial to McCain's loss, it definitely played a role.  But in addition to the political effects, Tina Fey's Sarah Palin called attention to her and by extension 30 ROCK to a degree not previously possible.  In its third season, 30 ROCK's dozens of fans grew to millions.  NBC suddenly had a hit show.Before going on, we should pause and reflect on this.  Today the networks do not exhibit much patience with shows.  If they are not instant hits, they are canceled.  Even if they get considerable critical acclaim, like PUSHING DAISIES, they will still get canceled.  30 ROCK had survived only because it got such an extreme amount of critical acclaim.  Its critical success more or less tied NBC's hands.  But my point is that after two low rated seasons, the show was a sudden hit.  I wish the networks would keep in mind that great shows always have a chance to become hits.  In fact, they have greater chances than the vast majority of new shows.  Patience with good shows will usually pay off.And what a brilliant show it remained in Season Three.  No doubt their collection of awards will grown once again and it will deserve it.  30 ROCK isn't merely the best comedy show on TV right now, but one of the best ever, possibly the best ever after only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  Absolutely everything was perfect.  The writing was simply jaw dropping, with the jokes spilling out at a breathtaking pace.  Most comedy shows pad out the script, pacing the jokes because they don't know if they can keep coming up with the good ones, spacing the jokes with mildly humorous dialogue.  That isn't the way of Tina Fey and her team of writers.  They just assault the viewer with jokes, one right after another.  There are so many jokes that you simply can't keep up with them.  You just can't digest all of them.  What is more, sometimes the jokes are presented not one at a time, but in layers, two or three operating at the same time.  The jokes are verbal and they are also visual.  I still can't get the image of Liz Lemon showing her female friends her yoga pose out of my mind.This is as brilliant a set of characters as has been seen since the Bluth family made their premature exit from television.  Liz Lemon is an absolutely brilliant character, a lead character plagued by feet of clay.  Liz never really does the right thing for the right reason, but at most does the right thing for the wrong reasons.  She might not have an evil bone in her body, but neither does she have a good one.  Much the same is true of the magnificently self-absorbed Jack Donaghy.  Everything he does, no matter how bizarre, is done to further the interests of Jack Donaghy.  And Kevin the Page is one of the most unexpected hit characters on TV.  I'm sure when they started the series they knew he was going to be good, but who knew he would be as good as he ended up?  I'm sure they were confident that Tracy Jordan was going to be a great character, and they were right.  And Jenna Maroney might even surpass Liz and Jack in seeing the world as revolving around herself.  What makes this incredible group of characters even more incredible is that every actor portraying them is extraordinary.  Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are simply the two best comic performers on TV and together they have created one of the great comic duos in TV history.There were some great comic arcs in Season Three.  Jack has a bizarre and out of character romance with his mother's nurse, played by Salma Hayek.  There is an unexpected glitch in it when her mother hates Jack because of his sharp resemblance to a villain in a Mexican soap (the villain is also portrayed by Alec Baldwin).  Liz persists in her efforts to adopt a child.  She also has a near romance with a very good looking neighbor, played to perfection by Jon Hamm, better known as Don Draper on MAD MEN.  Jenna wears herself out by simultaneously continuing to appear in THE GIRLIE SHOW while starring in an unauthorized biopic based on Janis Joplin (its being unauthorized meaning that in singing the Janis-like songs they can't use the real lyrics, something that leads to excellent results).  In short, hilarity results, again and again.The season ends on a highlight.  Jack learns the identity of his father, who just happens to need a kidney.  Much to his relief, Jack learns that he is not compatible, so they need to find a new donor.  So Jack twists the arms of Elvis Costello and other musicians to do a celebrity single.  The season ends with a group of musicians begging in a video for a kidney for Jack's dad.  Those performing on ""Kidney Now!"" include Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken, Mary J. Bilge, Steve Earle, two of the Beastie Boys, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, Norah Jones (who proudly sings that she is sober), Cyndi Lauper (who confesses that she is not), Sara Bareille, Michael Moby, Michael McDonald, rapper Talib Kweli, Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, Rhett Miller of the Old 97s, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata.  All in all, it is a pretty amazing assemblage of talent for a fake music video.So, once again 30 ROCK was a show that was hitting on all cylinders.  And now the ratings are strong enough that those of us who adore the show don't have to worry that the season that has just ended will be the last.",1244332800,2009-06-07

After a plethora of superhero flicks and CGI animation, with cross pollination of the same, I can't say that I found a whole lot of originality in the first twenty minutes of what I saw.It didn't hold my attention for all of the character reasons I mentioned in the first paragraph.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm really sick and tired of the man in the family always being the double digit IQ stay at home dad, and equally tired of the kids and mom knowing more than dad does.And does the world really need another superhero movie?  Well, one more couldn't hurt.  But domestic issues, to me, do not a movie make.I may try to give it another shot, but for now it's lost me.Rescreen; July 4th, 2013It's as bad as I thought it would be, and worse.  The ""villain"" isn't much of a villain, and the overall film is flat and lacks vision.  And the alleged superhero doesn't do much superhero work.  With a script put together by a committee and a market research team, thing is as sociopathic as they come.Having said all that, I'm sure it'll recoup its cost in the market, but returns will be modest at best at its current status.Avoid this thing or watch it with some comfort food, because you'll need it.",1366675200,2013-04-23

4.0,"Quick Take: Essentially, this is half a season for half the price. A non-sale, non-discounted price of 19.95 fits in line with almost six hours worth of DVD content. A full season, had it been released that way, would simply have doubled the asking price.Last year, History and A&E; Television made the dubious decision to start releasing Volumes of their most popular shows as opposed to Seasons. I was one of the most vocal opponents of this move and some of my scathing tirades can be found on those initial releases. In truth, though, I have nothing against the idea of volume releases (especially for shows that aren't held together by continuing plot threads) as long as three things are clear:1) They need to be priced according to content and no more expensive individually than a season set would be.2) Don't start releasing Full Seasons and then switch tactics mid-stream to confuse unsuspecting buyers.3) If it isn't a season, all content needs to be disclosed on the DVD packaging so the consumer knows what they are getting!Last year, many of these early Volume releases broke my second and third rule. I mean really! How can you release a DVD when it's not a full season and NOT tell buyers how many and which episodes are included? Absolutely unforgivable. I need that information to decide whether or not I want to purchase the set. As we have progressed, though, and the notion that we're to continue with Volume releasing has stayed with us, the point becomes rather more muddy. Now, we're past the second issue and the third issue has been corrected. All of these Volume releases now contain information about the content. So, there is no deception and no confusion. You get ""x"" number of episodes for ""x"" price. It's now up to you whether or not it's worth it. That's fair. If you don't like it, don't buy it.Volume Four of ""Pawn Stars"" contains sixteen episodes over two discs for just shy of six hours worth of content, basically consisting of the second half of Season Three. There are no Special features, but English and Spanish subtitles are optional. Included:(1) Cornering the Colonel, (2) Ready, Set, Pawn, (3) The Eagle Has Landed, (4) Like A Rolling Chum, (5) Hello Nurse, (6) Chumdog Millionaire, (7) Gone With the Schwinn, (8) Bare Bones, (9) Never Surrender, (10) Honest Abe, (11) Monkey Business, (12) Packing Heat, (13) Luck of the Draw, (14) Houdini's Handcuffs, (15) Pedal to the Metal, and (16) Case Closed.The show is entertaining for several reasons. Of course, some intriguing merchandise passes through their hands and you just might learn something. But as in any reality show, this one is as much about interaction and conversation as it is about the art of the deal. The Harrison guys are a colorful crew--real old school Vegas. Perhaps the biggest scene stealer is Chumlee (like an adopted son) who plays village idiot, but can surprise you as well. It's comical and engaging for the most part. All in all, it is rather like the unsavory and confrontational cousin to the classic ""Antiques Roadshow"" with more grit and edge. KGHarris, 6/12,",1339804800,2012-06-16

5.0,"update February 2010: Phoenix was just photographed clean shaven and no longer doing his rap act.  I hope this means he is about to return to film!original review:Joaquin Phoenix bizarrely made the rounds after this film, looking like a grizzly bear and stating that he was leaving movies so that he could be a rapper.  Cut to him performing as a rapper--he was atrocious!  Some say that this is a joke he is playing for a film his brother-in-law Casey Affleck is making.  I sure hope so.  Because the truth of the matter is that Phoenix is one hell of an actor.  After all, Paltrow is no slouch.  She has an Oscar on her mantle.  But he steals the thunder from everyone in this film.  He dominates it from the first scene and never lets go.He plays the Jewish son of a mom and pop business operation which has another mom and pop as a partner.  His parents and the partner start pushing this young woman for him as a highly desirable wife.  In all good conscience, in the movie at least, she comes across as better looking, with a better personality and in short, with a lot going for her.  He actually seems lucky to have come up with someone  this good.  He plays his guy as no charismatic ball of fire. He plays him as an ok guy but no one you'd be dying to date much less marry. (Phoenix has played the opposite with equal effectiveness, exuding charisma and sexuality, again showing how good his acting chops really are).Now here come the wrench.  Gwenyth Paltrow appears and she is clearly above his touch.  She is involved with an older, married professor. She is also a complete flake.  You just know, if you aren't someone who is smitten with her, that she is nothing but trouble.  She vacillates constantly over what she wants and flits around from interest to interest.  I doubt you'd want her as a friend. So, of course, Phoenix falls for her like the proverbial ton of bricks.To say anymore would ruin the plot.  I thought it was a terrific film with an unusual plot line.  It was focused, tight, well scripted and brilliantly acted.I hope no one buys a single rap record he makes!",1253577600,2009-09-22

5.0,"SUITS is smart, sassy, clever, sophisticated, timely and immensely entertaining! The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately.SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact.The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclich&eacute;d, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit!

5.0,"The history channel was one of the few cable channels left that had not expanded it's horizons into original programing.  They started out the right way with the Hatfields and McCoys mini series and their follow up with this series was amazing.  As with any historical fiction either on book or film, you will have die hard history buffs complaining about the accuracy of the facts, but I say who cares.  I loved this series from the first episode and the entire season did not disappoint.  It wasn't just sword fights and raiding parties, but this story explored the characters in depth making the story not just about action.  I haven't started the second season even though it's hard but plan on watching it all at once, and hope my patience is rewarded.

Seems Captain America always has to fight in the sky for the finale on top of an aircraft. I swear it was the same footage from Avengers. I think they could've fleshed out a better story as well.

I had high hopes given the producer, actors, and premise, but they're dragging the secret base/mysterious virus/conspiracy tropes on too long. Far too long. The actors are doing the best they can, but their characters aren't developed or likable enough to care about. Big name producer, rager-zombie types, and incongruous dated pop music don't compensate for weak characterization and thin storyline. My opinion? Initiate Quarantine Protocol -  leave it alone.

From the politics to personal interactions to the good people of a town, as well as the bad characters.  A little bit of sci-fy is thrown in too.  I was sorry to see the writers kill off the Sheriff as I like that actor.  But I'm liking the woman replacement, who is of hispanic origins plus it's a woman.  If you have not watched this show it's about te sudden appearance of a clear dome that drops over the small town of Cedars Mills.  The military attempts everything to destroy it without success.  The general concensus is it's a other worldly happening.  Time will reveal what caused it.  If anyone comes near the dome with electronics it causes them to explode.  Which explains what killed the Sheriff.  He had a pacemaker that explodes out of his chest when getting too close to the dome.  Watches, hearing aids and cell phones explode as well.

5.0,"This was the only pilot that left me smiling at the end. I enjoyed all the characters, including the guest stars. Also, loved the setting in New York City, but I'm a little biased there, because I'm from NYC. I also enjoy classical music, so it's nice to see a fictional show finally centered around the classical music scene. To me, the show reminds me of a mash-up of HBO's 'Girls', meets 'Fame', meets the film 'Coyote Ugly'. My only criticism is that the show was over so fast. I'd imagine it'd work better as an hour show, but I could be wrong. I just wanted to watch more. Gael Garcia Bernal was an excellent choice for the starring role. He's an amazing actor. As long as the classical music stays center stage and does not get lost in the soap opera drama, then I see a winner here.",1393113600,2014-02-23

3.0,"I tend to watch a lot of off-beat and non-mainstream movies. When you do this, you'll come across as much garbage as there was in the trash compactor scene in the original STAR WARS. However, every once in a while you'll uncover a gem. Sometimes, you'll uncover a really unusual movie that's really not all that great, but is so unusual that the very oddity and absurdity of it makes it stand out and worth watching through. RUBBER is one of those movies.RUBBER is a movie about a killer tire. The film opens with a man (Jack Plotnick) standing out in the middle of the desert covered in binoculars. Then a car comes driving up a dirt road destroying a bunch of wooden chairs that have been set up as though they were orange safety cones. The car stops and a man in a police uniform (Stephen Spinella) gets out and begins talking into the camera. He gives a long monologue about in every great movie there is an element of something happening for ""no reason"" and that's what this movie is all about. He then dumps out the beverage in his hand and jumps back into the car and is driven off. Then the man with the binoculars begins passing out binoculars to a group of spectators standing behind roped off pillars. The people take their binoculars and turn around and begin watching the movie. Throughout the rest of the film RUBBER moves back and forth between the action of Robert the Tire and the audience. Towards the end of the movie, the audience actually becomes a part of the movie.So, with the absurdist theatre element in place, the main ""action"" follows the deeds of Robert the Tire. It's never explained in the movie how or why (and Robert isn't even given a name, except in the special features and in promotional materials) Robert comes to be. He just rises out of the dirt and is. It takes him some time to get adjusted to just standing up and then rolling around of his own accord. But soon he's off and rolling. Then he comes across a plastic bottle in his way and he flattens it. Next a scorpion in his way meets the same fate. However, the next object is a glass bottle and Robert can't flatten that. This seems to upset him so tries to destroy it with his mind and succeeds in making it explode. So, now Robert is a living tire who has a type of pyrokinesis, he can't make things explode with his mind. Robert quickly moves from exploding bottles to exploding living things.In some ways RUBBER is a critique at the way Hollywood and the studios usually make movies. It's an insane process that doesn't make any sense to most people and often even confounds those in the movie business. I know there are countless times I've left a film thinking, ""How did they get to make that?!"" RUBBER pokes fun of that and the way that most people are just there to watch a good show. Yet, that passivity can make us animals. But, don't read too much into that. RUBBER is, after all, a movie about a killer tire.",1332028800,2012-03-18
4.0,"""Mutant Chronicles""(2009)----------------------------------------NOTE: mild spoilers below----------------------------------------This dystopian, post-apocalyptic, alternate/future-world action flick has a familiar feel... Indeed, much of the film is taken up with self-parody, gently poking fun at the genre in much the same way that 2004's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" lampooned the old action serials of the 1930s.  The story is set in a grimy, steampunkish world where the First World War is still being fought in the trenches and corporations rule entire continents. The endless war is interrupted when the combatants unknowingly uncork a mystic seal that held in check the mutant hordes from a distant planet, imprisoned there millennia ago by a religious order that is now run by the ever-lispy John Malkovitch. As the mutants massacre and multiply, it quickly becomes clear that Earth is doomed and an evacuation is planned. Malkovitch's high priest knows the secrets of the mutant horde and taps Ron Perlman (star of ""Hell Boy"") to recruit an elite squad for a military suicide mission to put the genies back in the bottle. The mismatched, misanthropic anti-team has been seen a bazillion times before (Aliens, Predator, et al) but the film's producers are conscious of their cliches, and take advantage of the situation to pause for some kitschy, campy joke shots -- overly-heroic poses and obligatorily grim, determined speeches.  They know fans are just tapping their fingers waiting for the action to start, so you might as well have a little fun with the formula, in a Sam Raimi-like way.The action really kicks in during the film's second half, and then the pace becomes relentless. ""Mutant Chronicles"" is not a tremendously innovative or imaginative movie, but fans will be pleased with this high-octane sci-fi/creature feature splatterfest.  Besides, any film where we get to see John Malkovitch get torn apart by demons is fine by me.  I'd give it a 3.5.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1252368000,2009-09-08
5.0,I just finished watching this and I'm sad it's no longer on. I would of watched this for years. The acting the script the scenery and the wardrobe. I was hooked the first episode.

5.0,I am very happy that we have a season 4 with Lost Girl. The show is exciting and interesting.The episodes are well written and the actors are perfect for the parts they play.

5.0,"I never would have guessed Serious Moonlight would live up to the excitement based on the description but I was totally wrong.  Even more surprisingly, the way the story eventually changes is somewhat complex and I was *not* expecting a degree of sophistication to the writing whatsoever.  A wife (played by Meg Ryan) duct tapes her husband to a toilet after he tells her that he's been seeing another woman and that the two of them plan to run away together on a trip the next day.  So... what does Meg Ryan do?  Why, she smacks her husband over the head with a flower pot, knocking him out cold on the floor!  When he awakes, he's wrapped up tight in tape and unable to move.This is definitely a comedy intended for women since the storytelling and atmosphere feels sort of feminine.  However due to the amazingly well-written way the storyline unravels with several twists and turns (including the mistress eventually playing a more important role and, more importantly, robbers coming into the picture to wreak havoc when they spot a golden opportunity to do so) I have no choice but to declare Serious Moonlight a comedy that *both* men and women can enjoy.  The many twists and turns guarantees that both men and women will be surprised and laughing hysterically at the way these events unfold.  Serious Moonlight manages to successfully weave a subtle touch to the story together in a way that both men and women will be able to appreciate.I really don't want to spoil more to the storyline since I feel I'd be giving too much away.  It's the kind of comedy that demands the viewer to watch every aspect carefully so as not to miss anything.  I just think it's hilarious that Meg Ryan ties her husband to a toilet and tries to reminisce about their many years in a relationship and doing so in a serious way assuming the husband will be able to think contently and reasonably without any concern for the fact he's tied up, LOL!  This is just one aspect of the storyline- the second half of the movie changes the situation entirely.  Great writng and highly recommended.",1364428800,2013-03-28

2.0,"It's hard to tell whether ""A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III"" is a good-natured bit of self-parody on the part of Charlie Sheen, poking fun at his reputation as a compulsive womanizer, or a vanity project designed to showcase the actor's now-legendary sexual prowess and playboy image. I suspect it's the former, but even if it's the latter, it still doesn't make for a very entertaining movie.In plot, the movie feels an awful lot like a full-length version of ""Californication,"" as a middle-aged, sunglass-wearing Angeleno laments how he's screwed up with the love of his life (Ivana played by Ketheryn Winnick) because he's never grown up enough to stay committed to a monogamous relationship.Writer/director Roman Coppola's eclectic, scattershot approach alternates between scenes set in reality - or a close proximity thereof - and wild, but surprisingly flatfooted fantasy sequences heavy on op and pop visuals and graphics (Charlie is himself a successful graphics designer) and light on originality and cleverness. Apparently, there's not really all that much worth taking a glimpse of in ole Charlie's mind after all. Indeed, despite a big name cast that includes Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and Patricia Arquette, the movie feels an awful lot like a third-rate film school project that somehow got green-lighted by an actual studio.",1375660800,2013-08-05

The best actor of the bunch &#34;died&#34; in Episode 1, so there really is no need to tune in any further.",1375574400,2013-08-04
4.0,"Note: this program is cancelled by the network.The cast, headed up by Ron Livingston who played the lead role in ""Office Space"" (available on amazon.com Video on demand which I highly recommend) as the second in command of the mission which is to visit several planets in six years, and who narrates the series via talk over, is talented enough to put conviction and believability into the roles, especially the roles of the astronauts on the spaceship. The script and dialogue move at a moderate pace (some may find it too slow) and so demands some patience from the viewer.From the pilot of this new series, it is very obvious that this is not going to be a ""Roger Ramjet,"" or ""Flash Gordon,"" type good guys wastes bad guys space flick. So be forewarned . . . it is a psychological Sci-Fi genre' although the technical work on the CG and other graphics is respectable enough.Through a recurrent series of flashbacks, the current six year mission is merged, blurred, related, or whatever ya want to call it, with a previous mission headed by Ron Livingston and the now commander of the current mission. During that mission to Mars, Livingston is ordered to leave two members of the crew behind as a tremendous storm is approaching just before the module is to blast off from Mars; and he does which burdens both he and his fellow mission astronauts with a great deal of guilt. Further complicating the plot, Livingston was romantically involved with one of those left on Mars, while at the same time there is great doubt as to whether they really had to leave the two behind, or whether they could have in fact waited a few minutes and saved them while safely leaving - an error in judgment that would have been made by the mission head back on earth who also happens to be heading up the current mission too.There are similarities to other well known Sci-Fi films such as Solaris and 2001 right down to an vague similarity in music to Solaris. These similarities are not blatant enough to be seen as rip-offs, IMO, but more like nods of acknowledgement and/or intended to evoke a relationship to those films which is completely acceptable as a cinematic device.The mild (relatively) sex scenes are understandable as a traditional way to attract a significant TV viewing audience, and are not exploitative, IMO, but enlarge on the relationships between the characters. The frequent flashbacks to events before the current mission I did find somewhat disruptive and wondered at times of their relevance to the plot. However, I did not find them as disruptive as the maddeningly frequent, disruptive and blatantly sexually exploitative sex scenes and vanilla content in such popular TV series as ""Lost.""I found the different nationalities and ethnicities enriching to the series so far, and fair although somewhat stereotypic; although a Hindu Indian, as in India with a first generation accent may seem clich&eacute;, it is not any more clich&eacute; than a white male who loves baseball and was born in a small town, and has a drunk for a father. I wonder, would a Christian of Indian heritage who speaks with a perfect English accent make the film more believable? Would an atheistic female Latino with an extremely strong libido or sex drive like the German woman seem believable?The object or thing in Bay 4 which seems to be the real one in control of this mission right down to who is included on the mission, is reminiscent of HAL in ""2001"", or Mother in ""Alien"" in that it has its own definite agenda for the space mission. The contents of Bay 4, what it really is, what its agenda is, its genesis, and how it took control of the mission, and why the mission leaders allow it to control the mission drives the tension in the film - and I for one am extremely intrigued. Actually, I'm just about besides myself with curiosity to the nature of what is in Bay 4. Well, it had better be good with all the build up.At any rate, the contents of Bay 4 manipulates the members of the mission both psychologically and physically, excludes two original members of the team by spontaneously giving them heart trouble just before the mission, and manipulates the selection of the current mission team members so that some very unlikely astronauts are included such as one who fails his swimming test, a test that is meant to immediately exclude anyone failing it.Interestingly, the ""thing"" in Bay 4 (at the time I am writing this the contents of Bay 4 is on the verge of being revealed I hope) doesn't seem to like using the mission for commercial exploitation by business interests back on earth; the mission members are scheduled to unveil a banner out in space for the ""Big Buster"" candy bar (or something like that) candy company on the eve of Halloween. To accomplish this, the contents of Bay 4 induces severe hallucinations in all but two of the mission astronauts which results in a somewhat humorous situation where all but two of them are trying to exit a bay door into outer space but are too terrified of their hallucinations to move. Two other members of the mission who couldn't make it to the exit bay are themselves very busy, one having PTSD flashback of the war in Chechenia, and the other attending to the hallucination of her dog dying.At this moment, just after viewing episode 8, I am waiting with bated breath for the next episode to see what in the heck is in Bay 4.To be continued . . . .",1258934400,2009-11-23

Now we have Centurion, about a group of surviving roman centurions who struggle to reach friendly ground after their legion is destroyed by Picts.  Combining great scenery, bloody violence, raucous humor with betrayals and backstabbing, this movie shows life in the Roman Empire as brutal and bloody.  And yes, we have warrior babes, more than in previous sword-fighting movies.  The soundtrack was a disappointment; for a movie with scenery and cinematography like LOTR, the background music was totally forgettable.

3.0,"I enjoyed LAY THE FAVORITE, but I&#8217;m not quite sure how to classify it.The film&#8217;s distributor is attempting to promote it as a &#8220;comedy,&#8221; but it isn&#8217;t one.  Nor is it a &#8220;drama&#8221;.So, what is it?For lack of a better term, I&#8217;ll call it an interesting &#8220;light drama&#8221; about the world of gambling.Adapted from the best-selling memoir by Beth Raymer, the story centers on &#8220;Beth&#8221; (Rebecca Hall), a former Florida stripper who travels with her dog to Las Vegas and winds up working for &#8220;Dink&#8221; (Bruce Willis), the owner of a small-time sports gambling enterprise.Beth and Dink soon discover that she is good with numbers, and the business begins to thrive until Dink&#8217;s jealous wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives on the scene, forcing the younger woman to quit Vegas and travel to New York with her new boy friend (Joshua Jackson) and go to work for a shady gambler (Vince Vaughn).  Unfortunately, in New York, gambling is illegal, and before long, Beth must call on Dink to help her out of a sticky situation that can land her in prison for a long stretch.Stephen Frears directed this entertaining film.The Blu-Ray release from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes several deleted scenes.

5.0,"This is by far one of the funniest pilots I've ever seen. Smart writing with a dark twist. The Onion is a treasure trove of amazing jokes and biting satire.Wired Magazine this month said ""Satire is reality pushed to its logical limit; journalism conveys basic truth. The Onion does both. The Onion calls itself ""America's finest news source."" The funny part? It is."" The same could easily be said with this show and its comments on 24 hour cable news.",1366588800,2013-04-22
4.0,"i really don't like the ava in jail aspect of the show, but the rest is good. Raylan is back to his ornery self, butting heads with his boss a bit more this season. the evil-doers in this bunch are a bit of a caricature, but still, creepy and deadly as all get out. I think they got rid of a promising character too soon, though. Boyd is back to being his charming, devious self, and while the whole cartel thing is so over-used and predictible as to be laughable, there is one scene that makes up for the entire shenanigans. no spoilers here though. a good season overall.",1397520000,2014-04-15
2.0,"If you are very new to the topics you may enjoy this series. And although there are some tiny portions of genuinely new and informative content, it is too little and too infrequent. It is frustratingly condescending and even silly at times for those who are familiar with the topics. None of the episodes are worth watching for veterans of these sorts of documentaries except perhaps the ""Is there a God"" episode.The ""Is there a God"" episode is surprisingly less condescending. The vocabulary is not dumbed down at all and the there are only a couple silly sidebar explanatory analogies. But the approach to the topic is brazenly insensitive, arrogant and potentially offensive to just about anyone who adheres to a religious Faith.From that episode, it looks like Stephen Hawking has chosen to join the ""there is no god"" crowd.",1392163200,2014-02-12

5.0,My wife and I are fans of the Mentalist and have been following along since Season 1. It's a clever show with good chemistry between the characters.

5.0,"Set in New York City in 1864, ""Copper"" is a 19th century procedural/mystery series following Kevin Corcoron an Irish immigrant working as a police officer. While fighting the south during the Civil War Corcoron's wife disappeared and his daughter murdered. Returning to police work after serving in the army, Corcoron obsessively tries to track down where his wife disappeared to and who was behind the murder of his daughter. Corcoron uses two connections from the war--the son of a wealthy industrialist and African American surgeon--to help solve crime in the Five Points area.The first season of the BBC series looks quite nice in its Blu-ray debut. We get 10 episodes (the first season of the series) spread over two discs. Blacks are fairly solid and detail remarkably sharp.The audio sounds quite nice as well with a lossless presentation of the British-Canadian TV series co-produced by director Barry Levinson. I should note that the audio is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and isn't a lossless presentation which is a bit of a surprise.I haven't seen the DVD set.The special features are quite good for the set as well. Strangely, the episodes that have commentary tracks appear to be on the disc TWICE on the discs. You have to click on the episode listed (and it appears that there are more than 10 episodes on the two discs because of this)to hear the commentary track and, when you do, you can only listen to the audio commentary--you're not able to toggle back between the regular soundtrack and the audio commentary (something I'll do if the commentary isn't the most revealing). It's an odd choice as usually the Blu-ray is enabled with the ability to toggle back and forth by just hitting the audio button on your remote. The first time I played the episodes with audio commentary, it was a bit confusing. Hopefully, in the future, BBC will be a bit clearer about this or allow you to just access the audio commentary by clicking on the audio button.The episodes with audio commentaries are:""Surviving Death"", with Tom Weston-Jones and Franka Potente""Husbands and Fathers"", with Tom Weston-Jones and Franka Potente""La Tempte"", with Kyle Schmid and Anastasia Griffith""Better Times Are Coming"", with Tom Weston-Jones, Kyle Schmid and Ato Essandoh""A Vast and Fiendish Plot"", with Tom Weston-Jones, Kyle Schmid and Ato EssandohWe also get six ""character galleries"" where the actors talk about their characters and their various relationships in the series. They are brief often featuring the same footage and, although a bit lean, are interesting.There are also 11 behind-the-scenes promotional featurettes focusing on different aspects of the production from the production design to historical accuracy. All of these are, strangley, presented in 1080i not 1080p but, I suspect, these are the same promo pieces that were on the website and they were never converted to 1080p.""Fontana in Five Points"" allows the series creator to visit the various real locations where the series is set. Fontana provides quite a bit of history about the real people that lived during the time as well as the background on the series. It's an excellent presentation that runs under 13 minutes.Equally impressive is ""Behind the Badge"" a brief documentary on the series creation that runs over 44 minutes.The option of watching the show in Ultraviolet streaming is also available but itunes is not offered as an option.Finally we get 24 deleted scenes for the series as well as a couple of trailers for other BBC TV series.A fascinating historical drama, ""Copper"" benefits from a terrific high def presentation. Although the audio commentaries are presented a bit strangely (and might confuse some) and some of the featurettes are in 1080i rather than 1080p, this is, on the whole an exceptional presentation of the series.Recommended.",1373414400,2013-07-10

5.0,the show mixes action and story pretty well. it captures the outlaw biker (from what i've seen) very well. there is just one minor problem. people from the inland valley of california don't use such big callege words. this is obvously written by someone with an education and not an outlaw biker from the valley.i just found this show and friends of mine say the other seasons are better. i can hardly waitand Katie Segal is HOT in her tight jeans,1318636800,2011-10-15
4.0,"When the whimsical ""Leverage"" arrived on the television scene in 2008, I had just finished watching the delightful British crime caper series ""Hustle.""  Needless to say, if you've sampled both programs--they share more than a passing similarity.  I know every ""Leverage"" fan was instantly enchanted by our merry band of mischievous do-gooders, but I just couldn't get the comparison out of my mind and the program lacked a bit of the easiness and subtlety of its like minded cousin from across the pond.  Subtlety is certainly never a word I will associate with ""Leverage,"" in fact, which usually plays so broadly and comically that it is often bordering on slapstick.  But, that's okay.  The erratic tone of the show soon steadied itself and the attractive cast stepped up with nimble comic performances.  A show about clever cons soon gave way to a show about clever con artists.  To me, ""Leverage"" works most successfully as a sly and humorous ensemble piece.Sure, there is often amusement to be had in the various cases (sometimes they even reach for genuine emotion as our gang tries to right the wrongs of injustice) but the strength of the show lies in witty banter and an easy camaraderie of our crew.  The cases themselves can range from laugh out loud funny to downright preposterous, but no matter how silly things get--the actors engage and sell it!  Gina Bellman as the grifter, Beth Riesgraf as the thief, Christian Kane as the muscle, and Aldis Hodge as the techie all give stellar performances.  They've grown into their roles and expanded beyond the initial stereotypes.  The inner battles and positioning within the team are priceless.  Ostensibly a vehicle for Oscar winning actor Timothy Hutton as the mastermind, he is actually the weakest aspect of the show for me personally.  I love Hutton in general, even thinking of his perfect performance in ""Ordinary People"" makes me a bit emotional.  But haunted by inner demons, he seems at odds with the easy feel of the show.  Also, in the cons, his accents and performances are so over-the-top--it reduces everyone else to moron level to begin to believe he is who he says he is.But, again, the show isn't going for realism--so all is forgivable.  I just never feel he is as deft at the comedic elements required as his compatriots.  Season Three attempts to make things more serious, however, in its second half by reintroducing Damien Moreau as the team's major nemesis.  I don't know, however, if multi-layered plotting or continuing storylines are the series' strong point.  The episodes that stick out for me are some of the outrageous stand alone shows.  My highlight is probably ""The Rashomon Job.""  A rather silly escapade, really, it is highlighted by the guys each sharing their version of what happened--and the way they describe their fellow team members elicited some of the largest laughs of the year!  Then there's Kane as a country superstar and Hodge as a concert violinist--two great bits.  As a comedy, I'd rate this a five star entertainment--but oftentimes the tone gets decidedly sentimental or serious.  ""Leverage"" is much less convincing in these moments, in my opinion.  But bright and breezy rules the day.  If you loved the other seasons, you'll undoubtedly love this one.  If you haven't sample the show yet, why not give it a peek?

4.0,Final season does a good job of wrapping up loose ends and entertaining the user.  Best season in my opinion is season 4.  Something happened to the writing between season 4 and 5 that left the first half of season 5 wanting.  Even with the season 5 writing being a bit poor it is still really good compared to almost anything else on tv. I wouldn't hesitate to see this.,1385510400,2013-11-27
4.0,"This is a story of Freda Kelly, who was the official fan club leader and secretary of the Beatles. In 1962 she was recruited by the Beatles manager Brian Epstein to work for the band when she was a 17-year-old Liverpool typist and a regular audience at the Cavern Club, and continued to be in office until 1972. In the documentary she recalls the early days of her eventful life with the world&#8217;s most famous band.In fact, most probably avid Beatles fans (including me) might have heard what she has to say somewhere before. The personalities of the Fab Four she describes (George is the quiet Beatle, etc.) are nothing surprising, but episodes about the family members of the group are interesting, especially when recounted by the very person who personally knew them.Other interviewees include Tony Barrow (Beatles press officer), Billy Kinsley of The Merseybeats (and director Ryan White&#8217;s nephew), Billy Hatton and Joey Bower of The Fourmost, and Angie McCartney. What they say has more to do with Freda than the Beatles, so don&#8217;t expect much.It is a bit surprising that the filmmakers are allowed to use four original Beatle songs for the movie. Though Paul McCartney only appears in archive footage, Ringo Starr himself shows up before the camera, giving a brief message to Freda and fans, which proves that she has been a trusted friend of the group.Though &#8220;Good Ol' Freda&#8221; does not offer new things very much, it gives a new viewpoint for us to watch the history of the band.",1390176000,2014-01-20

3.0,"The premise was original but that's as far as it went. The plot was repetitive even for a comedy like this. You basically know the story and it's a thin one. It just seemed like the script could've had more story elements to it. For instance, Zack Efron gave the frat a big speech in the beginning and vowed to create a major college tradition that would become legend like beer pong. So I thought we'd see the frat trying out silly ideas which we didn't. Neighbors has some laughs, don't get me wrong, it just wasn't a homerun. Note, the wife drops the F-Bomb like a drunken sailor, not really needed to me and it took her sweetness away. Looking back it's a forgettable comedy. I think a few more rewrites were needed and you could tell 3/4 in that the movie had run out of ideas.",1400371200,2014-05-18

3.0,"I liked the premise of this original pilot on Amazon Prime. A few inconsistencies or just dumb actions:1.) The girl who is the actress speaks horribly accented English, so much so that it is sometimes hard to understand her. Her emphasis is on the wrong syllable which I find happens a lot with people who have English as their second language and who have not bothered to improve their accent.2.) Again the girl: wanting to go after her phone when they ran from the luxury house so they would not be killed? And no one told her how ridiculous that was? Not even the guy with the big gun who should have a good handle on practicality?3.) The actions of this girl again: she took her time getting back to the trapped people and went back to her apt., bribing the hotel guy, so she could get her PHONE? The phone again. One of the first thing to go when society falls apart, I would think. Don't people have their phones with them the whole time? She also got some food but I didn't get what was so important to go back to her apt. She already had the gun right? I was confused about why she went back there....4.) So is it the writing?The creature was shocking and repulsive so that is good. Please shoot the Irish drunk.Please up your game on this story line, especially with the attractive girl with the accent. Yes, I get that she has a little girl. So? You really risk your life for a phone? Risk other people's life for a phone?So if this gets better I'm in. Please get better.",1392595200,2014-02-17

3.0,"This is a sword and sandal action movie directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, best known as the director of the first &#8220;Resident Evil&#8221; installment, and other so-so sci-fi themed films like &#8220;Event Horizon.&#8221; As in these films, there is not much originality in &#8220;Pompeii&#8221; as far as his storytelling or characters are concerned, but the film is still entertaining in its own way, with impressive special effects that are the real star of the film.The story is about a young Britannia-born gladiator named Milo (Kit Harington), who is brought to Pompeii, a resort town for the Romans, just before Mount Vesuvius erupts. He falls in love with beautiful Cassia (Emily Browning), daughter of the city&#8217;s ruler Severus (Jared Harris), but an evil Roman Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) also wants her. And Corvus happens to be the one responsible for the deaths of Milo&#8217;s family.Well, the story is very melodramatic, but anyway &#8220;Pompeii&#8221; delivers what it promises to do, I mean, the visual effects of the erupting volcano destroying the town. Paul W.S. Anderson must have thought the volcano is not enough, so the film also has a few sword fight sequences (pretty good) as well as a tsunami scene. Keep in mind that we are not watching a documentary.Still, lack of chemistry between the two stars is too visible to ignore. In fact, Milo&#8217;s friendship with his rival gladiator Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is more interesting than the romantic story of the film. &#8220;Pompeii&#8221; is not as bad as you may be led to believe, but the film, I think, could have been much better with a script that knows what story it really should tell.",1403827200,2014-06-27

I was hoping also that since Terry O'Quinn from Lost was featured, that it would have more to offer, but I like O'Quinn's character and the rest of the cast in fact. That is the only reason that I keep watching. I like strange and creepy shows like this, and have been since the days of Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond, The Outer Limits, Lost, Fringe, etc. I do like the setting for this show; a haunted old building called the Drake converted to an upscale apartment complex, and modern tenants confronted with the paranormal.

But, what stood out about this series is that it is beautifully shot and there is great care and attention by the creators when it comes to story and aesthetic. Re-watching this series from the beginning has been a rewarding surprise and I find myself wondering why this hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. Especially in a Network environment where anything that is different is as good as canceled. There are familiar cop procedural tropes, I will admit. But, this series deserves your respect for its bravery, and more importantly, it deserves your EYEBALLS!

3.0,"This review contains spoilers...!I found this film appealing in some ways but confusing in others.  I kept wondering what Sarah Polley was trying to do and then, the next day I remembered her autobiographical film, ""Stories We Tell"" which seems to me to explain the murky parts in this one.In ""Stories We Tell"" which came out the year after this, Polley reveals that the man she thought was her real father was  not, that her mother had had an extended affair with another man who was Sarah's biological father. Sarah's mother as played in that film, as well as actual footage of her, bears a strong resemblance to Michelle Williams's character.  They are both young, beautiful, blond, vivacious and sexy.  They are both artistically inclined but frustrated.  Sarah's mother was a sometimes actress and Michelle's character is a sort-of writer.  Both leave their safe, loving, respectable husbands for artist types, one a painter and one a film maker.  In Sarah Polley's mother's case she did return to the family but died soon afterward.  I had to wonder how much of this film was an attempt on the part of Sarah to make sense to herself of her own mother's behavior.  She succeeds beautifully in ""Stories We Tell"" but in this film, it doesn't quite work.The supposed moral of this film, is ""the grass is always greener..."" Or as the alcoholic sister-in-law puts it, that there is always something missing and one just has to find ways to deal with that hole.  Here the Michelle Williams character leaves her dull but dutiful husband for a more exciting one, but in the end it seems that happiness once again has eluded her and she seem to find her happiness by herself as shown in the last scene, where she rides alone on the amusement park ride.The idea that one can't look to another to fill up the empty hole inside is a valid one. The problem here is that the film doesn't really show that the second relationship is all that bad.  It seems like the characters Sarah Polley wrote took off with their own lives and left her intention in the dust.  Their romance in gorgeous and hot and totally believable.  Who wouldn't leave the poor chubby chicken-cooking hubby for the sexy, exciting, and NICE, painter (and rickshaw driver!)  Her hubby's idea of sexual foreplay is to talk baby talk, while the other guy practically sends her into orbit at their conversation over Martinis.  That and the underwater scene in the pool were the two highlights of the film, in my opinion, with the waltz to the Leonard Coehn song, a close third.  I'd almost buy the film for those scenes.So it was not all believable to me that suddenly this very beautiful romance is shown to be have turned sour.  The threesomes in bed seemed totally out of character.  This guy wasn't a cheap sleaze out for kicks and I don't think she was either.  A more realistic development to me would be that they'd have the children that she wanted and which her husband avoided having.It seems to me that the Sarah couldn't let her characters get away with their actions  and have a happy life together, that she had to make them wrong somehow.  Boo!  I saw the film more as a coming of age film for the female character.  She married the nice, safe, secure Daddy guy and they talked baby talk to each other in bed and played other silly games  At one point when  she outgrows that and asks him to do lose the baby talk he pouts and goes back to frying his chicken.  No wonder she was ready for the next stage in her development---a real, adult sexy guy who would definitely deliver.  I just think that Polley copped out by showing that romance as a symptom of the woman's weakness.  The film itself, belies that message.  I found the ending scene with Michelle alone in the amusement park ride not at all convincing, a failed attempt to make a point that she was forcing on her characters.",1380326400,2013-09-28

This is an unoriginal, uninspired cross between the Walking Dead and the show where Ichabod Crane is in 21st C New England.  it also cleaves to convention heavily; the pilot plot was quite predictable.  Oh, wait:  was that seriously Peter Sarsgaard in there for a minute?  It is shocking to see an actor of his caliber in this tripe.  THAT was unpredictable.  Honestly, this wouldn't make it ten episodes on network TV.  And that french chick is so annoying I found it difficult to make it through even one episode.  Her acting is worse than my french.  Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.",1391731200,2014-02-07
3.0,"I tend to fast forward episodes of this but it is very carefully and deeply thought out creation.  It's not just about putting Norman Bates' brand of sneaky evil on display - the whole town is wicked, seriously criminal in a smug, satisfied, financially rewarding way.  The Bates are just the amateurs albeit talented ones.It's interesting that the subtle performance probably explicitly demanded by the careful storytellers premieres around the same time as another famous serial killer character - Hannibal Lecter.  Both shows have moments of illumination where we see the killer's hatred and fury at the nobodies around them who unknowingly boorishly offend them.This show is five stars in terms of production values but you have to like this kind of thing and I don't really enjoy it or maybe this show isn't meant to be enjoyed.  Vera Farmiga is excellent at acting out Norma's self centered, embittered disappointment.  Her carefully put together outfits say so much about her frustrations and desires as well.",1368576000,2013-05-15
1.0,"This movie is in Spanish only and this director & his producer need to be boycotted on any movie they make. False advertising. They have the DVD cover and title in English... but to watch the movie, you either have to read subtitles or closed captioning. It is a sham to use false advertising to sell  to unsuspecting shoppers. They did the same thing with Pans Labrynth.It also would not have been a huge imposition on the director and producer to provide an Alternate English audio option like we do on our English speaking movies. This is the second and last time this director will ever sell any movies to me. I will never buy another of his movies even if every movie he makes from this point on is in English... because he's used up any trust we may have had. So when his career goes in the dumper in the US... don't blame the economy. Blame yourself for deceptive advertising and printing the DVD cover in English. If the cover and title had been in Spanish to begin with, we wouldn't be so irate because we would not have bought it in the first place. I have thousands of movies in my collection but this will be the last time this director ever darkens my viewing.I have nothing against Spanish. In fact I lived in Panama for 2 years.. but I don't want my movies in Spanish and I certainly don't appreciate the deliberately deceptive False English DVD cover and Title to make us think the movie is in English.If any of our US producers or Directors put a Spanish label and Spanish Title on a DVD cover and tried to pass it off to the Spanish speaking countries ... and then only had the movie in English or French... I suspect their consumers would be very angry as well.They wouldn't like it anymore than the Germans would want to watch a movie in Arabic or Chinese.Amazon is also responsible for this deception by allowing it to be marketed in English. If a movie is in Spanish, then the Title should also be in Spanish. And since this is an English website... it should have a huge warning at the top of the page telling English speaking shoppers that this movie is in Spanish only!And as an added note: This director does cheesy, immature camera effects. Near the end, he just goes nuts with his 360 camera rotating around the main character... it seemed like 5 minutes of nothing but spinning. It got so monotonous I had to fast forward just to get away from it. This is something a 16 year old would do shooting a movie in his garage for a school project.And let's not forget that the kid with the sack over his head was a cheap takeoff on Jason from the ""Friday the 13th"" movie series.Avoid this director and producer like the plague!!!",1232755200,2009-01-24

The show &#34;The After&#34; and &#34;The Rebels&#34; caught my attention from the very beginning while &#34;Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street&#34; lost me immediately.  The writing wasn't as great as the other shows and while Fionnula Flanagan is quaint as Miss Hudspith and Robyn Lively is more beautiful than ever the rest of the show has its flaws.

5.0,"i enjoyed this episode because of the nature of the challenge. work clothes for women has to be as real world in fashion as one can get. marie claire now has a special magazine for this and notes it is a very fast growing market niche. this is a team challenge and there is a lot of personal drama because the contestants hate working in teams.i think the results came out as particularly useful for the working woman in New York City. the winner was very leading edge and pushing the envelope.  it would take awhile to catch on elsewhere. but that's ok.  fashion is always looking ahead.two examples show the risks one takes with complex construction techniques. raoul's blouse is very complex because of one layer after another put on the very front in a black filmy material.  i am not sure if this is supposed to be pleating.  this was a disaster. the technique was overly fussy and not executed well.  the fabric was a bad choice for working women and for this technique. by contrast, christopher works on changing the texture of the fabric in a skirt. the fabric is a pretty print and it looks like cotton broadcloth which is a good choice for this technique.  this gives a new dimension to the fabric. although the fabric is now more complex, he makes the construction of the skirt itself simple.  this works very well.another mistake is huge sleeves on a jacket.  the last thing a woman wants to battle at work is a giant sleeve construction at her shoulders. the number one criteria for work clothes should be fluidity and huge sleeves miss that by a mile.interestingly, the contestants who work worst in the team environment have the worst designs. i think they spend a huge amount of time caught up in the drama of the team dynamic rather than in thoughtful design work. i think concentrating on reconstruction of the fabric itself into a simple garment, like the skirt, is a useful way to make it through these team challenges.  that way you have a great piece for judging that will also not clash with your other team members' work. another team member's jacket over this skirt was not very good but the skirt still worked with it.also, i would have relied more on the experts doing the photo shoot rather than trying to redesign their set like elena did.  she got so caught up in the props and the set that she forgot about the power these people have with their cameras. the last thing i would want to do with professional fashion photographers is second guess their ideas on setting up the stage for a fashion shoot.",1345248000,2012-08-18

5.0,In this season we leave the world of spys and enter into the world of organized crime.  The characters drive the story and the mystery/discovery again keeps it going.  This season shows how much relationships can effect character development.  How even when a person is on the bottom rung of their character other people can help them climb back to their best.  How much depth can sometimes be hidden beneath a shallow exterior.  The characters are definitely not preachy but many of them have a solid hidden strength.

Not a very good one here.&#34;A Ride In The Park&#34;-A young man goes riding in the woods, with a camera on his helmet of course, some lady is vomiting and well he ends up bitten by her.

This is a bit longer than the other &#34;tapes&#34; not a bad one, in fact probably the best of what's featured here. Acting is at least a little better than the first two, with a lot and I mean a lot of violence especially towards the end.&#34;Slumber Party Alien Abduction&#34;-No this isn't some 70's or 80's campy horror/comedy (very well could've been) but what happens when beings from another world come after us. It's not a terrible scary one, none of the characters are likeable, save one but well the best &#34;actor&#34; doesn't meet the best end.

4.0,"&lt;strong>Jsan-nin no Shikaku&lt;/strong> (Takashi Miike, 2010)Takashi Miike has long been one of Japan's most innovative, versatile, and original directors while still managing to be one of its most prolific at the same time. Despite this, he managed to labor in relative obscurity in his home country for almost a decade before exploding onto the international scene with &lt;em>Audition&lt;/em> in 1999. He experienced a brief period of worldwide notoriety, releasing such smashes as &lt;em>Visitor Q&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Ichi the Killer&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>The Happiness of the Katakuris&lt;/em> before slipping back into obscurity. Why this happened, the world will likely never know, but it was only a matter of time before they took notice again. Another decade later and &lt;em> Jsan-nin no Shikaku&lt;/em>, released in English-speaking countries as &lt;em>13 Assassins&lt;/em>, kicked off a second, and hopefully more enduring, wave of Miike-love in the west. &lt;em>13 Assassins&lt;/em> is a film from Miike's growing obsession with the historical-drama subgenre, in which he has quietly built up a reputation for releasing fantastic movies that never received the media coverage of his bigger, showier releases.Plot: Lord Naritsugu (&lt;em>Saimin&lt;/em>'s Gor Inagaki) is next in line for the Shogunate. No one, including the existing members of the Shogunate, want him to actually take a seat. So when a member dies and Lord Naritsugu begins his journey from Edo, thirteen assasins are hired to stop him. The first half-and-change of the film is the assassins training to form a coherent unit, with us getting to know them, as well as Hanbei (Masachika Ichimura, who has since become a Miike regular), Naritsugu's personal bodyguard and the assassins' chief opposition, and Naritsugu himself. (Naritsugu is a bad guy. And I mean a &lt;em>bad&lt;/em> guy, one so bad only Hanbei's honor stops him from deserting Naritsugu once he realizes what a morally bankrupt morass of evil this guy is.) Then comes the climactic battle, which most people characterize as the second half of the film. I timed it; it's actually forty-seven minutes. There's a coda afterwards that ties everything up in semi-satisfactory fashion (as long as you're at least passing familiar with certain aspects of Japanese mythology). But the second half of the movie is definitely focused on the forty-seven minutes of stunning choreography, brilliant atmosphere, and unrestrained violence of that final fight scene.Miike's remake of a 1963 period piece (of the same name, directed by Echi Kudo) is faithful, from what I have read of the original, which is still somewhat hard to come by, but it also draws pretty heavily from &lt;em>Seven Samurai&lt;/em>. At no point, however, can this be mistaken for anything but a Miike film, as is true with all of Miike's best work. And this certainly qualifies as some of Miike's best work; the first half is quiet and tense, the second absolute chaos, and they show a director with an ability to work just as easily in both while creating the proper atmosphere for each. Not an easy task. (Note how the lighting suddenly gets really, really gloomy, after a gradual fade throughout the film, as the assassins are preparing the ambush, for example.) There are those little touches of Miike wackiness, though some of them take, shall we say, a darker turn (the incident that causes the assassins to be hired, when its aftermath is finally depicted, is the hardest scene it's been to watch for me in a Miike film since the final fifteen minutes of &lt;em>Audition&lt;/em>), there's the usual we're-not-QUITE-overacting-but-we're-really-enjoying-dancing-on-that-line, there's Miike's ever-honed sense of pace. In short, it's Takashi Miike. Short of someone who can't stomach violence, I can't imagine anyone not liking this, just as I can't imagine anyone not liking &lt;em>Sabu&lt;/em> or &lt;em>Ley Lines&lt;/em> or &lt;em>The Bird People in China&lt;/em>. It's far too early to call this a classic, but I think when the chips shake out half a century from now, people will still be watching &lt;em>13 Assassins&lt;/em>. ****",1341532800,2012-07-06

4.0,"A Black woman slices the face of another Black woman.  It takes 30 scars to fix and the victim will have that slash for the rest of her life.  The Marshals go to Upstate NY to solve this one.This has a scene similar to one in the film ""About Schmidt.""  Remember when Jack Nicholson's character remembers his birth home and it's now a tire store?  Well, one officer remembers his early time in Utica.  They show a photo of his uncle who also worked in law enforcement, and he had a deep, juicy, Kirk Douglas-like butt chin.  If you love the saucy, burrough-oriented flavor of this show, you may miss it as the LatinA officers from other seasons aren't here.  Still, if you like those ""Sopranos""-type East Coast accents, you'll hear a lot of it here.On the one hand, this was a blackchick-on-blackchick crime.  How could a sistagurl do that to one of her own!?  However, in the course of this episode, two other Black women try to hide/protect the perpetrator fiercely.  Their loud and belligerent behavior just reinforces sistagurl stereotypes, however.  So there is some unity amongst da sistahs here, but it's used to protect an individual who was in the wrong, sadly.Luckily, the perpetrator gets a heavy punishment.  The episode concludes with the victim learning that her assailant was captured.  I too concur that ""people are people,"" but wearing an Afrocentric and womanist hat, it can be saddening to hear and see the facts presented in this particular show.",1330214400,2012-02-26

5.0,"there is an absolutely cracker jack exorcism in this episode.  it is right up there with the scenes from the film THE EXORCIST. in this one there is no head turning all the way around but short of that, there is everything any horror fan could want in a horror tv episode. this does not involve a continuous character as the character is brought in by his parents to the asylum for the first time in this episode and his story ends there. best of all, we get to see Jessica Lange get into it with the subject of the exorcism when she is left alone with him.i did not previously know that electroshock was used to ""cure"" lesbians back in the sixties.  this also occurs in this episode.  i checked online to see how true this was.  it is true and apparently some fundamentalist christian groups in the usa still espouse it as part of conversion therapy to turn gays into straights. actually the most shocking part of this is discovering that it is not fiction for the show!lots more going on as well but the above serves as an appetizer if you are considering buying this episode.  go for it!",1351209600,2012-10-26
5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  Fantastic television for those who don't need the ""boom, bam, biff"" of cookie cutter crime series on network television.  This takes patience following the almost authentic details of the murder of a young woman in a major American city.  The back slapping, rotten core of politics, everyday policing and the destruction of the victim and the victim's family is dead on.  This is how everyday people respond to the devastation of a horrific crime, no ones an angel and life is full of contradictions. Someone really did their research and aimed at a smart, thought provoking, layered piece of modern day film noir and succeeded.  Unfortunately because the target audience (18-34) may not be interested the 3rd season may be the last.  This show might to do better on PBS to compete with British crime stories.

5.0,"There will always be great TV shows that get cancelled before their time. But the cancellation of Life was especially painful. The first season, like many other series, suffered from the writers strike, and only 11 of 22 episodes were made. This didn't stop the creators from producing a quality product, but the reduction in episodes made the tail end of that season feel rushed. The second season has 21 episodes, and they make the most of them.Life succeeds where many shows fail in that the show is able to focus on the main characters lives while still delivering interesting storylines that play off said characters quirks. Some shows feature characters with great chemistry, but the creators seem to think that chemistry is enough to hold a show together. Storylines will often take a back seat to the minutia of the lead characters, and hurt the show.In Life the characters personal problems are intergrated into the storyline making them feel organic, and much more enjoyable to watch. The cases they go on are never normal, but they never cross over into being wacky. The criminals are never your cookie cutter bad guys, but instead individuals with their own unique motivations that make them far more dangerous, and alot more fun to watch.Damian Lewis gives an incredible performance giving his character a wide array of emotions that never feel forced. Sarah Shahi is wonderfully grounded when standing next to Lewis and acts as a friend and not just the straight man that has become standard fare, though she does that very well. The new captain, played to great effect by Donal Logue,  complements the cast perfectly and never feels lile his character was forced on us. When Sarah was with child, Gabrielle Union stepped in and delivered a performance that did not try to copy Sarah's, but made the character her own.This is a phenomenal show that was cancelled long before it's time, and you will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not see it.",1251504000,2009-08-29

4.0,Nothing better then real people telling their ghost stories with many times compelling evidence. While I do think some people are too eager to want to see what they want to see. I think many times its the non believers that tell the most compelling stories. Because they don't just believe but try and debunk what is going on. This is not a show trying to scare as much as it is trying to document events people experienced in there home or on a trip.

I hate the wrongful death trial and the smarmy plaintiff's lawyer; it is an impediment to an otherwise intriguing, excellently acted story and well developed characterizations.  Welliver and Wersching are both great and make watching a complete pleasure.  Establishing that Bosch has a semi-sordid, psyche-affecting past can be done without dragging out a dreary, trite courtroom &#34;drama.&#34; (Although, Abraham Benrubi as the defense attorney is inspired casting).

I most certainly agree with.It was also,  VERY hard to ignore the unbelievably gorgeous wardrobes of some of the actors, particularly the character of Bellinda who looked like she stepped out of Kate Middleton's palace.  In fact they they could be twins separated at birth, who now have their makeup done by the same professional cosmetologist.There is a natural beauty in women which is not enhanced by pancake makeup, carefully waxed eyebrows and all the rest.  We are supposed to be looking back at History...as it was.  Yet, every time one of the perfectly manicured female actors showed up, the &#34;reality&#34; of it was destroyed and I could only stare and wonder how a director such as Ridley Scott or Discovery could have let that happen.I will finish watching all the episodes because of Tim Roth, the scenery and the educational aspect.

4.0,"This is one nicely filmed but mean as heck crime thriller with as many twists and turns as your favorite roller coaster. The two kidnapping criminals play the main part. These unsavory individuals are not there for the viewer to like or to identify with. They are innately repugnant. The worst of the two of them is suspicious of everything and ready to get crazy violent at any second. The victim is pretty, but she is no more pleasant than the criminals. The bad guys have the whole thing planned out and practiced really well, but a lot of unexpected stuff happens and the plan gets desperate really quickly - and the viewer has no idea who will survive this scenerio. There are some really suspenseful moments that will keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. There is a ton of tension and drama between the three characters. The acting is all around very good. Beyond the kidnapping, a few tussles and some bondage, there isnt much violence. There is no need for extreme blood and gore. There is some (hetero and homo) sexual content, and there is a healthy dose of (male and female) nudity. If you start this movie, you wont want to stop until it concludes and you can finally stop holding your breath.",1306800000,2011-05-31
5.0,"It initially was difficult to like the characters in the first season of ""Sons of Anarchy"". The criminals were violent with little about them to like. The surrounding characters seemed to have been drawn into their bad situations at their own choosing. Even the ""good guy"" law enforcement personnel were deeply flawed and generally despicable. As the season progresses, the story lines and conflicts became more intriguing. The season ends well with one wanting to find out what the future holds.There are some general plot lines of ""Sons of Anarchy"" that are reminiscent of ""The Sopranos"". Both series had mother figures with a strong presence where one realizes that, in a family feud, the mother has deliberately and potentially let her son be placed at risk. That is some wake up call for the main character. In both series, the main characters need to consider how to handle ""a rat"", yet to give ""Sons of Anarchy"" great credit, their story line on this is gripping. This is a series that slowly grabs the viewer and pulls the viewer in.",1372204800,2013-06-26

4.0,"Season Two of the TV series ""Jericho"" wasn't supposed to happen... the taut, terrifying post-apocalyptic drama had been canceled due to weak ratings, but was revived by the network after intense lobbying by fans.  In this second season, the claustrophobia of Season One gives way to paranoia as the town of Jericho is taken over by a provisional Federal government based in Nebraska. As it turns out, this new government is the result of a political conspiracy, and the citizens of Jericho, like Kansans in the 1850s and '60s, are caught in the middle of a chilling civil war.The ensemble acting of the first season is replaced by a fast-moving, plot-heavy political narrative over which contemporary (Iraq War-era) politics cast a long shadow. The new government installs a Halliburton-like mega-corporation in charge of all economic activity in the town; this company also owns a private, mercenary security force (ala Blackwater) which terrorizes the locals. Finally, the townspeople have to take a stand: are they going to knuckle under to a powerful, remote dictatorship, or will the spirit of 1776 survive?  Action junkies and fans of political conspiracy-theory films will dig this.  Although it may feel a little rushed, this short season (only seven episodes were made) ties up most of the loose ends, and should satisfy most fans.  Fun stuff, and a little scary, too.

Anderson is robotic in her role.  The stories are meant to be reflections of evil and depravity and generally succeed.  It will be hard to maintain a series based on a new serial killer each week.  It would be better to have story arcs of 3-4 episodes.  I don't believe the series will last beyond two seasons.,1394841600,2014-03-15
5.0,"Wow! It's sci if and I absolutely LOVE it. Please, please, pretty please make more of this. The pilot is suspenseful and the story line  is intriguing. If any pilot should get the green light for a full season The After is the one. The story has an unlikely hero, the black guy and I think the Irish guy will be one also. Please Amazon go ahead and make the rest of the pilot. Release it as a DVD and I will surely purchase it the day it hits the circuit. The After gets 5 stars from me. I am recommending this to every sci Fi and suspense fan out there.",1391817600,2014-02-08

4.0,"A Lonely Place to Die is a movie best seen knowing as little as possible about it so, if you've avoided learning about the plot so far, just watch the movie. It plays with expectations and conventions to appear to morph from genre to genre while actually staying true to its own story. It's an adventure tale that moves along briskly without dawdling where it shouldn't and without rushing, either. The few very, very slight missteps are only apparent in contrast to the assuredness of the rest of the film and they pass, quickly to be forgotten. The Scottish Highlands setting verges on beautiful familiarity but reveals strangely beautiful alienness as the film progresses. The action and stuntwork in the film remains at a human level and is all the more effective for it.",1321920000,2011-11-22
3.0,"This show gets 3 stars for having great acting and being fun to watch, but it's more in the vein of  Hollywood &#34;based on true story&#34; than actually historical. Normally, that would be fine, but this is the History Channel, or use to be at least. Hopefully, the use the show as an opportunity for documentaries on the real historical figures and acts that inspired the show. For me, though, trying to keep the true separate from the fiction was too difficult and I opted not to watch the rest of the season after 2 episodes.So maybe you're wondering what was so inaccurate? Am I one of those people who can't stand the vikings weren't wearing enough armor, that characters are a little more badass than real life, that there are hints at fantastical elements or that all the women somehow have access to massacre and hairspray ? No, I realize this is a TV Show and sometimes being able to see characters' facial expressions or adding some foreshadowing can help that along. So maybe I'm annoyed by a few hundred years of Viking technology and events all getting compressed into one loose-cannon-who-doesn't-play-by-the-rules? Nah, compression can help move a story along and give us a hero for the story.It annoyance is the overall narrative where the Vikings are shown as an ignorant, dirty, savage people seemingly isolated from the rest of Europe. This completely unnecessary portrayal forces the Vikings into a weird &#34;New Land&#34; narrative whereby the Vikings don't believe there is any land to the West, and Ragnor bravely sails it find a peaceful native people and proceed to pillage them. The Vikings are made to be completely mystified by the written word (staring at it dumbly before burning it), unnecessarily killing every single monk, and completely unaware of Christianity. Never mind that the Vikings had been trading with people in the current U.K. for decades before. Never mind that the Vikings had their own written language. Never mind that it is unlikely the raid was random, but at least the result of gathered information, if not some kind of retribution. And while the real raid was very brutal, not every monk was killed or taken captive, many were left alive and the monastery continued to function.There is some attempt to soften this brutal portrayal by showing a Viking court proceeding with laws and something of a trial. Women are also shown to have some power in society with Ragnor's wife coming across as fiercely independent (ironically, a woman fighter would be very odd for real Vikings). However, this effort is quickly erased by other women getting raped or threatened with rape as everyday occurrence. (The Vikings are believed to have had anti-rape laws and strong taboos against harming women, although the treatment of foreign women and slaves is probably up to interpretation), and the town chief has two men brutally killed without a trial for minor acts of treason. One of whom appears to be the only blacksmith, and the other a loyal spy.Whenever the writers can make the Vikings out be their stereotypical crass, ignorant, dirty, violent men, that path is chosen. While the Christians are beyond peaceful, learned, and clean.",1387065600,2013-12-15
5.0,"I have been a huge fan of ""Elementary"" from the first episode, and I look forward to a new one on Thursday nights.  The writing is great, with plenty of suspense and humor.  I like the twisty plots, and I love the relationship between Holmes and Watson.  The dialogue is believable and funny; at other times, it can be heartbreaking.  These two characters work so well together, leaning on each other, being tough and demanding when necessary. It's all good, and I am enjoying the ride with this show.I also want to mention that the acting by the entire cast is incredible.  Jonny Lee Miller is showing us his best work so far, in my opinion, and reveals many different layers with Holmes.  Just when we think we know him, sort of....he surprises us, and Joan, with his sensitivity and empathy in certain situations.  Jonny Lee Miller is underrated and may never be recognized with an Emmy, but he SO deserves one for this performance.  I am also very impressed with Lucy Liu's performance as Joan Watson.  She has great chemistry with JLM and I'm glad there is no ""romantic"" or sexual tension between them, at least not yet.  Aidan Quinn is perfectly cast in the role of Captain Gregson.  He adds so much to the show, and I hope to see his character fleshed out more in future episodes.I would highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys suspenseful crime dramas with a few twists and plenty of humor.",1389830400,2014-01-16

5.0,"Upfront, I'll admit I'm no fan of the late Elmore Leonard.  Never liked his books, or for that matter screen adaptions based on them.  I ""love"" Carla Gugino, but hated ""Karen Cisco"" for example.  He's in the same boat as Carl Hiaasen I think, quirky, weird, and largely unreadable (""Get Shorty"", please!).  I'm a U. Miami grad and lived in South Fla. for 4 years but while I'll agree it's different, it ain't as different as Leonard and Hiaasen see it.That's why ""Justified"" has come as a surprise.  Of course, it has going for it the compelling performance of Timothy Olyphant in the lead as Marshal Raylan Givens.  Olyphant was incredible in ""Deadwood"" and has brought his interpretation of a lawman into the current century with equal aplomb.  When you add in the superb acting of Walton Goggins as nemesis Boyd Crowder you have a winning recipe for one very entertaining program.  Goggin's turn as flawed cop Shane Vendrell in ""The Shield"" remains one of the most impressive performances in a drama you are going to see on the small screen.  This is a program for adults; so that means there is adult language, there is violence but it is not gratuitous nor excessive.  The showrunners pack a ton of story in each episode so you'd best be paying attention.  Supporting cast is excellent and help to balance some of the excess of the leads- truly a collaborative effort.  I don't have cable, but prefer to purchase DVD's of shows that interest me when they come out; we are waiting patiently for Season 4's release so we can enjoy another visit to Harlan County and the world of Raylan Givens as envisioned by Elmore Leonard.  Definitely recommend.",1379203200,2013-09-15
4.0,"I have watched the entire series and have found a strong story line, good acting from the main cast members.Season five is most violent because the group being involved with drug cartels .

5.0,"I have to admit, I was a little worried about where the show would go after Red John, but in just a few episodes my doubts are erased.  Now that Jane has avenged the murder of his family, there seems to be a possibility of his actually being happy again at some point, and it really shows in the lighthearted manner with which he &#34;breaks in&#34; his new team members.  I also like that there is still a larger subplot, running through the episodes.  Jane's loyalty and affection for Lisbon has always been one of the nicest parts of the show, but it would always have felt wrong for there to be anything more to it.  With his wife's murderer dead, he doesn't have to be &#34;the arrow sprung from the bow&#34; any longer, so who knows...  :)",1394928000,2014-03-16
1.0,"I detest streaming videos. Where is the DVD set for the 2013 Dallas season 2? I want the hard copy. Not some virtual version controlled by a 3rd Party. Consumers need to stand their ground to ensure we continue to have the option of DVD's for our movies & TV episode seasons.Fortunately, I did tape every episode on VHS as a precaution just in case they pulled a dirty trick like this. Season one was immediately available on DVD at the end of the broadcast season. But season 2 is nowhere to be seen. No evidence they plan to offer DVD's at all for season 2.I don't use DVR's because those are worse. As an example, the network was able to have the cable & sat providers delete a controversial episode of Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory from every DVR it had been recorded on. These deletions surgically occurred across multiple providers who claimed it was a software upgrade glitch which deleted this one particular episode on the same week, about 2 months after it was aired, from the DVR's of every customer which had recorded via DVR.  Fortunately, mine was on VHS where they couldn't get to it. There were hundreds of viewers complaining in the online forums how that episode was deleted on all of their DVR's despite using different providers. You can probably still find these complaints online.This is just one example of the drawbacks of soft copies like streaming video, DVR & instant episodes. Even if the DVR was disconnected, a command can be inserted to delete an episode the next time the unit is accessed.  At any future point, these can be remotely deleted with simple commands. Many years ago, I was on the original design team for these DVR & interactive set top boxes for the cable & sat companies. The capabilities for these devices are far more invasive than anyone can imagine. Why do you think they give away these DVR boxes. I specifically purchased plain set top boxes from direct TV which do not have DVR's. Also, by owning the equipment, they cannot arbitrarily upgrade or change anything.This info will likely mean nothing to you until it is too late; after one of your recorded episodes has been deleted without warning & blamed on some glitch. All it takes is the fear of a lawsuit for a network to order the discreet elimination of some episode without warning.Also, avoid Ultraviolet DVD's which install spyware on your computer & can delete other movies & videos on your computer which is determined not to meet certain standards. You should be able to find comments on this website which pertain to the drawbacks of Ultraviolet.Fighting to insist on DVD versions for movies & TV just may be the last vestige of control remaining between the public & absolute control of providers. Once you lose those freedoms to choose; they wont come back.Welcome to the ""1984"" version of a controlled society.",1369526400,2013-05-26

I don't want to pay to watch a bunch of dorks when I can just go down to Hollywood and find them on the street there. I want to see a 100% full hour of BHHW drama. Not 80% Real Housewives and 20% dorks. It's fine if you want to do a show with just dorks but I don't want to be forced to watch dorkism.,1384732800,2013-11-18

He is probably the most restrained of all the characters and that seems like the right way to play it. I'm glad I watched it, but I don't want to own it.  For me, more nudity would have made the movie a beter example of the genre. The scene with the topless women hitting a guy with baseball bats and then Drake taking a swing was great. If the violence, story, lighting, etc are nonsensical then showing skin should be too.",1336608000,2012-05-10
5.0,"Having read, watched, researched samurai, this is one of the few that really express the intensity and life of honor that the true samurai lived for. Their education included so much more. They looked for and cultivated art and beauty, within and without. And honor, that was an art. This was an epic film, and although there were some minor plot holes, such as how a small village and 13 men were able to create a trap of such magnitude in such a short time, still it echoed the true spirit of the samurai, and for that it gets 5 stars. There was no glossing over the brutal life and death situations they found themselves in, chasing and being chased with 3-foot razor blades. There was also none of the fly-by-wire fights or over-the-top blood sprays.  Samurai didn't believe that life had no meaning, they believed that one had to GIVE it meaning, and boy did this film show that in spades. Yes, it was somewhat dark, but in several scenes one can see the care and grace with which they lived. Also, at this time, samurai were pretty much 'titled', and most did not have the training or the desire to pursue the ascetic life that often was required. That is shown here as well. Those who enjoy stories that have historical significance and deeper meaning will really enjoy this film.",1396137600,2014-03-30

5.0,"Whoa.  I mean lets be honest, as far as characters go, as far as episode plot lines and mysteries go, and as far as thematic material goes, lie to me has always been good.  Even if it's not your cup of tea.  Acting has been spot on.  Writing has been brisk and entertaining.News flash: it just got real.All of the characters have been fleshed out to the point that now we see some conflict amongst them and not just between them and episode villains.  This is where a lot of shows balk, screw up, choke.  Not here.  And neither do the writers take the show in a direction unwanted with that conflict.  Well done.Also they increase my respect in the area of new blood.  While they are introducing strife into the protagonist party, they are also introducing us to new characters.  No half-assery here.  Not only are any new characters interesting and believable they are entertaining. Well done.And best of all in my opinion, the mark of a truly great thing.  They keep the main hooks in place.  Many things change to much and loose the audience they had and do little to gain a new one (i'm speaking of anything here: Books, movies, tv shows, video games).  Many things try to hard to keep what they had and bore the audience they have.  The balance is a shy creature that many fail to capture.Lie To Me catches the little guy smoothly without missing a beat.

2.0,"(SPOILERS) documentary discusses Hollywood's transition from film to digital, i.e., how hard the movie industry fought digital, how George Lucas' tenacity helped get it established, and the mixture of emotions (some wistful) from filmmakers seeing film move out and digital move in.  In some ways, film to digital is an example of a way our species adopts new technology: someone discovers a new tool, or a better way (in the case of digital, George Lucas and his team); the established guard (Hollywood) resists, as they've invested heavily in the old technology (in terms of time, learning, and money), plus the new technology has some disadvantages (initially digital not as good visually as it is today), and the technicians, and everyone working in film, doesn't know how it works, or how to marry it with their current way of working, all of which generates fear/anxiety - so they basically ignore it;  while others (who have less to lose and most to gain, i.e., Robert Rodriguez, and other young and/or poor filmmakers) enthusiastically embrace it, exploiting it's advantages (real time viewing of photo capture, cheaper, and after a learning curve, ease of editing, etc.), to create their own brand of art, a significant amount of which becomes successful thus getting the attention of Hollywood who seek to emulate their success.  So now, by 2013 we see digital adopted into the Hollywood mainstream.  I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves, which is why I wanted to see the documentary, and I'm an even bigger fan of George Lucas, who wrote my favorite film, Star Wars, A New Hope, so it was great seeing them, and all the other filmmakers and technicians talk about film.  Alot of what the technicians discussed went over my head.  The documentary itself wasn't told in an especially engaging way, but it was okay.  Probably will be of interest to future filmmakers studying film history.  For me, an ordinary viewer in the present, two and a half stars.",1368921600,2013-05-19
5.0,I love this show. They did so well on the animation and h Jon Benjamin is amazing and hilarious. Awesome!,1389139200,2014-01-08
4.0,"Staid, even-keeled Madelyn gets the shock of her life when she discovers, quite by accident, that her husband of many years is cheating on her with a much younger woman. Then, through a series of complicated events, she winds up as the confidante and advisor to her husband&#8217;s mistress who has no idea who Madelyn is. In fact, the two women both make a pact -  Madelyn with full knowledge of what she&#8217;s doing and Lucy wholly in the dark - that they will leave all their major life decisions up to the other person - an ostensibly more dispassionate and objective person - so as to avoid incurring any more self-inflicted mistakes in their lives.Written and directed by Joan Carr-Wiggin, &#8220;If I Were You&#8221; plays much like a modern-day Feydeau farce, its humor based on a complex web of interconnected coincidences, misunderstandings and strategically withheld information.  It&#8217;s a clever, insightful little comedy that, by carrying its ironies and implausibilities to an almost absurd level, manages to make us face - and, even more amazingly, laugh at - just how real and cutting the pain caused by infidelity, romantic relationships and even platonic friendships can be.  But the movie also deals with such heady themes as deceit, betrayal, hypocrisy, self-worth and a woman&#8217;s place in the world, all without breaking a sweat. In fact, this becomes a growth experience for Madelyn who soon learns that she has a purpose and identity of her own apart from wife to a cheating husband.It&#8217;s true that the movie sometimes feels like it&#8217;s a beat or two off in its more broadly comic moments (especially early on the film) and the ending rates as a bit of a cheat and copout, but those weaknesses are easily overlooked amidst fine performances by Marcia Gay Harden, Leonor Watling, Joseph Kell and Aidan Quinn and an overall wisdom about how life works.",1385337600,2013-11-25

Experts recreate Ancient Egyptian chariots and harness, using one from King Tut's tomb and wall paintings, then test them. In the Bronze Age, Egyptians refined the heavy chariots of the other Near Eastern empires into fast, light, and well sprung vehicles that could be driven at a gallop and rain arrows on an enemy in a rapid approach and wheel attack. A must see for ancient military enthusiasts.",1361318400,2013-02-20
5.0,Easily the best new comedy on tv and quickly becoming one of my favorite shows. It really reminds me of the first seasons of The Office but in a police station which sounds like a strange idea but it works perfect. The first season was great especially seeing Peralta (Andy Samberg) and Captain Holt (Andre Braugher) interact and become closer. Joe Lo Truglio is awesome as Boyle giving some truly hilarious lines throughout each episode as does Terry Crews who's basically playing himself it seems. Honestly the whole case is pretty amazing and everyone usually gets there time to shine. Definitely will be recommending this show to everyone.,1396310400,2014-04-01
5.0,"Watched the pilot twice in a row. It was an entire season of any great series crammed into a single 1 hour episode. How? It has the group behavioral dynamic that Walking Dead does without the zombies. Events melded well at the beginning and by the end have a nice sense among all elements. Constant movement and situation changes through the entirety. Pay attention to detail and the various quirks and motives of the cast. There is more going on than meets the eye and logic as well. I think perhaps Amazon/Producer(s) pulled every trick they could to make this a seller right off. It's never too over the top, but pushes the limit. Each character is well developed from the start and if indications hold true we will see more of the group internal dynamics develop just like they have in Walking Dead... Keep in mind it hasn't been determined as yet what is actually going on. But the local area of incident is definitely in chaos. If Amazon can pull that off every episode, then it will be massive competition for AMC, A&E, and FX. I might even consider changing my watch time priorities of The Blacklist or The Following in favor of this so far new take on SHTF situations that have become so popular in the past few years. In they can keep it up, they can set a new standard that will have Netflix wanting to bring something more and just as big as their current line up. Gloves off fellas. But fight fair anyway.

4.0,"I wasn't sure how I would like this show; I watch other shows such as BONES and CASTLE faithfully and love them, but this seemeda bit more serious and dark.  I have only seen the first 5 episodes (where are the others?) but like what I see.  I was born in Illinois andlived in Chicago when I was very young and later after I got out of the military until I moved to NY.  But I always had great affectionfor the Windy City and enjoyed my time there.  I like the CPD and think dispite certain reputations that they do a great job there.This show seems to capture the grit of crime  fighting and the cast is extraordinary in make up.  The chief guy was a character onCASTLE and  a friend of Beckett until he was murdered.  He helped her get closer to Castle which I liked.  I get the episodes thatare available on my Video Library at Amazon and the quality is quite good.  I hope this series continues on a long time after thisgoofy Olympics is over.  I will write more as the  series continues but I recommend it to all those who like crime fighting series withguts.  I only gave it 4 stars because I have only seen 5 episodes to date but I think it will deserve 5 in the future.Since I first wrote this I watched more of the series and really fell in love with the show.  I love the cast, the photography and ofcourse the city.  This program is darker than BONES and CASTLE, but is gritty in every way and The Big Town has got to be a tough placeto work as a cop.  I will be buying the DVDs when they are out though this is a new series and it will be a while until that happens.  SoI will continue to get the episodes on my Video Library to watch again (without commercials!).  Unfortunately all these type of shows havemountains of adds but I guess we have to put up with them.  I watched one episode of CHICAGO FIRE which is produced by the same folks andhave no opinion on that yet, though it seems promising.  enjoy!!  I get all my stuff from Amazon.",1392940800,2014-02-21

5.0,"Though he may not have the type of characteristic and overt style which turns directors into households name, Kevin Macdonald is among the more gifted and interesting film artists of his generation, able to step with ease from the art-house to the studio system and from documentaries (One Day in September, Touching the Void) to narrative features (The Last King of Scotland, State of Play).  His latest, How I Live Now, is an end-of-the-world drama which for a while plays as a modern fairy tale before segueing into a more traditional, but still exciting and well-paced story of pursuit and political strife.  The films open with troubled American teenager Daisy, played by Saoirse Ronan, coming to England to live for a time with family friends.  Their rural farmhouse is a wonder of production design, crowded to the ceiling with artifacts indicating a deep history of fascinating world travels, and Macdonald does not fail to capitalize on the old-world beauty of the building and the pastoral area in which it is situated.The film can be divided into three distinct parts, and the first focuses on the thorny Daisy's slow embrace of her new situation and the people around her.  Predictable, perhaps, but sold through novel use of voice-over (Daisy's thoughts, from eating-disorder anxieties to vicious barbs against her absent father to inward pleas to step outside of her comfort zone, are laid atop one another in disorienting explosions of sound reflective of a teenage mind on the verge of frenzy) and the vivid performance of Ronan, given a rare chance to play a 21st-century teenager who is neither otherworldly nor melancholy and soulful beyond her years, but instead angry and flawed in recognizable ways.While her step-aunt is away, a nuclear bomb is dropped on London as a third World War begins.  The focus of the film remains tightly focused on Daisy, her love interest Edmond, and his siblings as they try to understand events transpiring around the globe from their limited perspective:  the power goes out, nuclear ash falls and coats the gardens, etc.  This section of the film is unusual, hypnotic, and, in a sinister way, very beautiful, resembling Lord of the Flies by way of Alice in Wonderland as the small group of children have only each other to turn as the distant world tears itself apart, both protected and entombed by the isolation of the farmhouse.  Once the military enter How I Live Now, bringing with them martial law, gender divided camps, and the specters of execution and rape, it becomes a more easily understood disciple of 28 Days Later, Children of Men, and other recent films depicting modern society in free fall, but the lead performance by Ronan remains riveting, and there is an admirable refusal to turn away from the grim aspects of warfare and social disorder, rendering this an unusual example of a teen centric film with a relatively hard R rating.  One or two conceits which were fine in the novel from which the film is adapted, including the ambiguous nature of the force invading Britain (nationality?  political views?), prove a bit frustrating in a cinematic context, but this is still an inventive and worthy example of the post-apocalyptic film.",1384041600,2013-11-10

4.0,"This was a terrific series.  I enjoyed it so much that I didn't mind paying for it.  But for Amazon to cancel the show, especially leaving one of the main (and the most likeable) characters on the show, hanging was a really lousy thing to do.  I'm wondering now ,if they can end The Glades on such a cliffhanger, there's no reason to expect they won't do the same with 'Bosch' after just one episode.  I realize it takes money to make programs but not sure if I want to spend money on them only to be ripped off.  Very disappointed in Amazon which surprises me, always been happy with their products and service.",1401494400,2014-05-31
4.0,"British actors do a great job with this unusual alien invasion story.  What is it like?  Well, don't expect state-of-the-art special effects; don't expect elaborate costumes, spaceships, or aliens.  Rather, you will find a delightful British cast who makes the story line work, because you like the characters.The storyline?  It starts with WW-II when a strange craft and ""being"" crash... but very soon we are transported to out current time period and must figure out what happened with the WW-II discovery.  I won't share much more of the detail of the story except to say that aliens have come to invade...both good and bad aliens.Note well: it is a short series, but I was involved in it after the second episode.  The storyline builds from episode to episode, as does the excitement.  For anyone who likes Sci-Fi and also for those who like good acting, this series is worth the watch. It isn't spectacular like ""Falling Skies"" on TNT, but it will pleasantly surprise.  I give it 4 stars.",1375574400,2013-08-04

It's about a group of students who confront a man accused of poaching bears in Norway, only to find out he actually works for the Norwegian government tracking trolls.  The story line was very inventive.  The effects were pretty good and keep it above an average B movie.  The acting was really good, and the twist at the end was great too.

5.0,"as one of their own is shot and killed by the terrorist Gibbs has been hunting Ari.  The season also shows how the different NCIS members are dealing with this tragic loss in a two part episode Kill Ari.  This in turn leads to the new characters, Ziva David and the new NCIS Director (who has more than a little history with Gibbs).This all blends in well and the new members of the team pick up right where they left off.  With all the quirkiness and fun that they have in each show, it only helps to show much the actors/actresses have grown together and it makes NCIS one reason that i love to watch not only this show.  But others of the same caliber.  I am looking forward to season four as well as the 3rd season ended in a particular way.  It leaves a lot of things open for the following season.But it also answers a few questions before the season is up like Gibbs past and how that affects him in his job today.  I love all the characters in the show-Abby, Ducky, Dinozo(sp), ""Probie"", Ziva and the like.  As each of them has their various moments throughout the season from killing an undercover cop, to a prisoner dying in custody or a mentally deranged ex-boyfriend that just won't go away.Along with some cool special features, NCIS is a show that is best watched from the beginning so that you get the full effect.  So buy the 1st seasons and start from there.  By the time you get to season 3 you'll be well versed and know what all the buzz is about.  NCIS is the real deal when it comes to TV shows period.",1223164800,2008-10-05

4.0,"This is an Australian movie, so don't expect a Hollywood budget. I did find it to be well written, acted and directed, with an interesting story.The first thing I did when I finished watching the movie was to google it to find out if it was a video game tie in. It isn't, but it the story definitely reminded me of some of the better, well written sci-fi survival horror games. It also has Japanese Anime Sci-fi vibe as well.We have the top secret government facility. We have scientists doing some very frightening and unethical research that goes horribly wrong. We have the elite military team sent in to clean up the mess, with test subjects to be eliminated, internal security to be neutralized and civilian scientists to be rescued. Things aren't quite as they seem and the elite hit team finds itself facing challenges it is not at all prepared for.I think people who enjoy sci-fi survival horror in movies, video games and anime may enjoy this movie. Those who have no experience in the sub-genre may have no idea what's going on here, while I got it right from the start and even predicted some things in advance due to my familiarity with the genre.Judged vs. good high budget sci-fi, this movie may pale in comparison, but I found it to be intelligent and enjoyable for what it was and much better than most low budget fare.",1374278400,2013-07-20

4.0,"I have to admit from the outset that I fell in love with the original series and still am.  When I heard that there was going to be a redo of the show, I couldn't image the ability of creating the kind of 'romantic magic'  that made the original series so special.  This show is not a repeat and only the names have been carried on.  With this series Catherine is an NYPD detective and Vincent is a former doctor whose genes have been altered by the military to create the super soldier in a failed program.  The focus or subtext of the new show is dealing with Vincent being in danger by the government, whereas the originally series focused on those living underneath the city, victims of the Reagan era.  The original was a sly critique of that period in time.  Now, the possible problem with this show is that with Catherine not a police detective rather than an ADA, they show has to be particularly sensitive to episodes when she will need Vincent's help.  She can't really be a victim here since she made it to detective, etc.  Anyway, I do recommend it and advise patience to see whether the network will allow this show to grow and develop.",1350086400,2012-10-13

3.0,"One of the hallmarks of the first two seasons of ""Friday Night Lights"" was the show's ability to really use its ensemble cast to the fullest.  Each week would shine the spotlight on a different character scenario or two, and if those weren't the ones that appealed to you...well, you knew that the next week it would be something different.  While this third season does a good job of moving certain storylines forward, it also turns rather repetitive at times in terms of the areas it really focuses in on.For a basic summary, Season Three is one in which we (as viewers) say goodbye to some established figures and welcome some ""new blood"" into the fold.  Because the writers strike of 2007 completely screwed over Season Two's ""ending"", the beginning episodes of this year basically just get us back up to speed.  From there, a few things given to us in this installment include:-Mrs. Taylor's new role as school principle and the new perspective it gives her on certain issues.-The continued evolution of the Tyra/Landry & Tim/Lyla relationships.-Jason Street doing everything he can to provide for his new ""family""-The ongoing foibles of Buddy Garrity.-A new QB threat to Matt Ceracen.There are some parts of Season Three that work very well.  The chemistry within the Taylor family is still the backbone of the show, and it still never fails to produce emotion in nearly every episode.  The ""new QB in town"" angle is also probably the strongest one of the entire season.  Tami's new turn as school principle also brings up some moral dilemmas that prove quite interesting.The trouble with this season, though, is that all the other angles fall under the following two categories: Either they are done too quickly (Smash Williams, Jason Street), or they linger on for far too long (Tyra's rebellious streak, the ticking time bomb that is Tim Riggins).  More specifically, the characters of Tyra & Tim (who really stood out in the Second Season) are given more screen time but less character development in the sense that they don't seem much different from beginning to end.  It is probably a case of the writers knowing that such drama works with most viewers and being a bit scared (in the wake of cancellation) to stray too far from the formula.Overall, then, I can't rate Season Three of ""Friday Night Lights"" nearly as well as its two predecessors.  Whereas those earlier seasons were high drama with pockets of repetition, I felt that the formula was flipped in this case.  The ending of the season set up a scenario that looks like it has great potential to produce an entertaining fourth season, so I'm not giving up hope just yet.  I'm just a bit concerned that the show has ""slipped"" a bit with each subsequent season so far.",1352246400,2012-11-07

5.0,"Having lived in Portsmouth, NH (essentially a smaller Portland, OR), this show has always had a special place in my heart, because I can so readily recognize the characters and stereotypes that are spoofed on. I keep thinking that Fred and Carries must be about to run out ideas soon, but fortunately, I've been wrong! Season Three is just as hilarious as the first two seasons, perhaps even more so. The first episode, where Fred goes ""pasta crazy"" is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. They also take on things that should be mundane, but by spoofing on how ridiculous the concepts actually are (like splitting a birthday dinner bill among a large group of acquaintances), they turn it into something unique and hilarious. I loved the reappearance of many of the shows' regular characters, such as the mayor (who tosses a laser printer into the river to prove that he's environmentally friendly, is ostracized by the community, and then ends up living with a bunch of goats- and no, I don't consider that a spoiler, because it's just so ridiculous). Filmed in 20 minutes bursts of skit-loving madness, these episodes fly right by, and each of is a great pleasure to watch. Thank you, Fred and Carrie!",1379116800,2013-09-14

To the TARDIS my friend!4/7/12 - Don't judge Clara by the Ponds.  Each companion is truly unique and once again, I believe the Doctor is in for an emotional rollar coaster with this one.  She is his conundrum and not afraid to step to the plate.  I have absolutely enjoyed the first 2 episodes of this partial season and I'd bet the season finale will be among the best and a guarantee that me and my fellow ""Whophiles"" will await season 8 with baited breath.4/12/13 -  While I do miss the Ponds, the second episode with the new companion has brought me to one conclusion - Clara will be AWESOME.  She dishes it out as good as she gets, is highly intelligent in her own right, and is establishing her own character line, just as the Ponds did, so she is far more than ""arm candy"" for the Doctor.

4.0,"This series is surprisingly good since the premise and the characters could easily make it simply formulaic. Here's my one criticism: if you're going to write a crime series which supposedly takes place in SE Florida given the constant reference to the Everglades, try checking a map and a few facts now and then. Too many sloppy references to cities on the west coast of FL as if they are right next door. Also, the episode about the hurricane is ludicrous. A high school reunion during a hurricane? A category 2 storm causing the type of wind damage portrayed?  Fact checking helps with credibility.",1396742400,2014-04-06

5.0,"I have never before (and will never again...probably) seen a show as delightful as this.  NYC has been integrated.  Demons, zombies, werewolves, robots, koala men, kongs (as in King Kong) and a never-ending parade of weirdos, misfits, and unidentifiable creatures all live together in peace and harmony.  Well, not so much peace and harmony, but they would if Mark Lily had anything to say about it.The show follows the rather inept - albeit good-intentioned - social worker as he tries to make a life for himself while doing his best to help the underprivileged & mentally, er..., &#34;special&#34; newcomers integrate into the wild city.  The antics the viewer is privy to already make the show a fantastic piece of work.  But what gives the viewer that sort of giddy feeling when they watch is the fact that the artists and animators have crammed every frame with sight gags.  From wacky posters, to the most random, off-the-wall, background characters/scenes, to easter eggs that reference past episodes, there isn't a single frame that doesn't convey just how creative (or crazy?) the people involved with this show were.It's a shame this work of art received only two seasons, but they're both superb and worth watching again and again and again...",1392940800,2014-02-21

3.0,"Stanley Kubrick is one of the all time great directors. He puts a lot of thought into his films. But is the ride worth the fare?Here's the scoop. A hand full of film enthusiasts felt there was more to the Kubrick's &#34;The Shining&#34; than meets the eye. So they did some research and watched the film over and over to get it to reveal its secrets. Many secrets there are and Kubrick went out of his way to bury these within the film. But, having found them, is &#34;The Shining&#34; any better for it?There is little if any doubt of Kubrick's precision as a director. This is noted by any number of film critics as well as other directors. So, when these folk uncover all these hidden aspects, most of them are probably right on. Some are grasping at straws. The section of super imposing the film playing backward over it playing forward is an entire waste of time. But much else is very convincing. I truly took pause on the conspiracy angle pegging him as the director of the first American moon landing. This has been floating around for decades but this is some of the better evidence I've seen. But, does it make it a better viewing experience or is it just better for the puzzle solving crowd?One thing that always frustrated me in viewing film is trying to determine how smart a director was. Did I miss something in the movie? Did the director mean a certain something or did he screw up? I don't always trust myself so I can't always rust the director. But subtext matters. In &#34;The Exorcist&#34; putting a fiercely changing society as a backdrop for the narrative does work on a subliminal level. But some of what these viewers find in &#34; The Shining&#34; is buried so deep I can't imagine it working on any level that would add to the film. It might be genius at work but it's only for the few who endeavor to dig really deep to find it.This is well worth seeing, but maybe not for the reasons the film makers intended.",1390262400,2014-01-21

5.0,"Chelsea General is home to some of the top surgeons in the world, thanks in large part to the hospital's notorious Monday morning morbidity and mortality - or ""311"" - conferences. In these legendary meetings, Chief of Staff Harding Hooten (Alfred Molina) leads a harsh, closed-door review of the complications ... encountered and mistakes made during the course of patient care.This paragraph up above is what amazon wrote For their Piolit.  Im telling you  this so you don't think i wrote it and stole it. I just thought it was perfect. I would like to add to it.  What do NYPD Blue, House, ER, and in my opinion ""Monday Mornings"" have in common?  They all revolutionized tv.  Monday Mornings is the opposite of ER.  ER was fast moving, and through the eyes of the ER from all angles and perspectives.  The camera work was fast, as in any urban ER you have very fast movng doctors with all kinds of issues coming through the doors.  In one scene in ER Neela was stating why she wanted to be a surgeon and not in the ER.  Well Surgery is planned out most of time, and a plan is in place even if it is on the moment surgery.  The ER she said you have to think very fast and not to much time to think or plan.  Well in Monday Mornings, you see all aspects of the surgeon's side of thigs.  And these meetings also known as ""311"", or Mobidity and Mortality meetings...They focus on even the smallest of details that could have gone better. The chief of staff runs these meetings as a way of making the doctors better.  He is not a nasty character, and in fact you will grow to love him and this cast.  In the spirit of being short, its about surgeons and how they deal with life, each other, and most of all ""the patients"".  And Monday Mornings looks deep into all that can go wrong, even when things have gone right.  ER was the first of its kind with the camera work, the actors spoke of how they  had to get it right, and how hard it was to keep up and move around all those cameras. This show is slower. They have done a great job moving the characters along. I feel invested in them already. The actors are all great and all play their parts perfect in their own way. They do the surgery and then have the Monday Morning Meetings.  Which by the  away they have at ten o'clock at night as well. Please watch from the beginning. If you liked any of the shows i mentioned earlier, i think this show is ground breaking as well. One problem.  TNT could at any time take it off the air.  I fear they might.  If they do, after one more season, i will not watch that station again. this will be it.  They have a hit show and a very unique show.  I hope they continue to do it right.",1365724800,2013-04-12

4.0,"This episode felt like an overwrought effort toward explaining mental illness and the intricacies of the brain.  The facts of these matters are a part of life that is interesting enough without over dramatization.  While representing a high functioning person with mental illness is a valuable experience for our culture and television, a Hollywood-studio emphasis using stereotypical plot ploys and characters does the basic concept a disservice.  I hope this series settles down a bit into real story telling without the over-hyped trajectory of story telling.  The characters, including the protagonist, his assistant, his advocate at the police department, etc. are terrific.  The President of the school, played by Levar Burton, just seems silly, again a tool for some comic relief rather than a real person.  A bit of balance and less bright lighted fade-aways would help.  Edit added:  ""Asylum"" episode the most compassionate and reality based episode thus far about the ""brain entrapment"" that is mental illness.  I appreciated the patient-centric tenor of this piece, especially when explaining how delusions are, at times, more like reality and the ""greater sum of its parts.""  Disbelieving, discrediting, dismissing were all missing for the consideration of what aspect of delusion and mental illness experience is real.  That is unusual in any program or book for that matter. The mental hospital components were represented in a reasonable fashion though not entirely within the scope of reality (a dimmer light accessible to patients?  I don't think so!)",1372636800,2013-07-01

2.0,"Let me clarify this from the get-go: I'm not one of those reviewers who seeks to kick the stuffing out of `found footage' films.  All you need to do is peruse the reviews I've done here at Amazon or elsewhere to know that I'm entirely accepting of this sub-genre.  I'd go so far to say that I enjoy them quite a bit so long as there is some quality story, development, and characters at the heart of whatever footage the producers allege to have found.  Granted, I do believe these flicks work best as horror upstarts, but that doesn't mean I won't appreciate a few dramatic turns here and there, and, to its credit, HOLLOW thinks it knows what it's doing in presenting four young folks - two couples, basically - enjoying a weekend outing in some romantic and spooky setting.  Unfortunately, HOLLOW should've known better.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of characters and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)There's a tree on a hill in the middle of a small remote village that - rumor had it - has been haunted by a local legend ... for, in the hollow of this massive, somewhat disfiguring tree, there lives a dark spirit that seeks out young lovers in the midst of some relationship strife and convinces them to commit suicide.Now, if you stop right there, I'd argue you have the makings of a possibly mystical thriller.  You have all the right elements - an evil place, an evil spirit, and an evil cause - that coulda, woulda, shoulda made for a nice picture.Unfortunately, then they made the film.Emma , a/k/a `the innocent one' (played by the lovely Emily Plumtree), and Scott, a/k/a `the alpha male' (Matt Stokoe), long for a weekend away from it all; and, hoping to share it with a few friends, they invite James, a/k/a `the jilted ex with a troubled past'(Sam Stockman), and Lynne, a/k/a `the slutty one' (Jessica Ellerby), to join them.  Emma's grandfather - the pastor for a small, country village - recently passed away, and they're heading there to make use of the premises, despite the fact that it has no electricity.  Once there, they find themselves all equally creeped out by the legendary tree of local lore, and, before their weekend getaway is over, they may find out just how real and deadly folklore can be.Some `found footage films' clearly give `found footage films' a bad name, and HOLLOW is part of that growing group of flicks made clearly to capitalize on a sub-genre but not provided enough spine upon which to build a perfect body.  In fact, all there is to HOLLOW is its twist ending - not all that big of a twist, and certainly one you can see coming from ten miles away.  These characters aren't given any legitimate depth - though I've read some reviewers who think the introduction of relationships and faithlessness accounts to `character development' (here's a tip: it doesn't) - and, instead, they're all archetypes plopped into a `locked box scenario' with very little hope of escaping.In that respect, much of HOLLOW works just fine.  There's a benign charm to some elements of the film - the introduction of the local church mythology surrounding the suicide tree, the fact that there exists more than ample evidence to support some paranormal phenomenon in the vicinity, etc. - that work well enough to establish the premise; however, when writer/director Matthew Holt essentially delivers an ending an audience knew from their very first frame, why bother at all?  Why not, instead, give viewers a legitimate reason to hang around for 90 minutes by creating characters that mean something more than just fitting the stereotype?  These are four relatively self-centered and stupid individuals who one could argue get just what they deserved for being so mind-numbingly self-centered and stupid.  Don't be shocked when they get their comeuppance.Sadly, a sense of `nothing new here' pervades so much of HOLLOW.HOLLOW is produced by (how fitting?) Hollow Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled through New Video.  As for the technical specifications ... well ... the video looks and sounds about as good as the next `found footage' flick, though I'm alarmed by the increasing use of a camera at night when the characters are running while essentially filming the ground.  Sound is good, but the herky-jerky camera work really could've been improved.  Also, there's an awful lot of turning-the-camera-off (to save battery near the end), but, boy, it's sure good that they turned the camera on just as something was about to happen!  (Don't give me that gobbledy-gook about them ""needing the light,""either.  I didn't just fall off a truck.)  As for the special features, there's only a two-minute ""story behind the scene"" wherein the director gives you his two cents about how and why they shot the ending the way they did; it's interesting, but it ain't all that special, nor much of a feature.RECOMMENDED only if found footage films are REALLY your thing because, otherwise, I'd be hard-pressed to see what value one might find in HOLLOW.  It isn't that it's poorly made because, in most instances, the production quality is there.  While I wouldn't agree with some stylistic choices made, I strongly disagree with those who think there's a winning 90-minute story here because there isn't.  At best, it's a half-hour Twilight Zone episode stretched out into 90 unnecessary minutes.  Once you experience the ""engrossing and effective"" ending (their advertising words, certainly not mine), perhaps you'll agree.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD screener copy of HOLLOW for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1360540800,2013-02-11

5.0,"Will journalist Kristina Borjesson's 2013 television documentary T.W.A. FLIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED create enough word of mouth to pressure the authorities to disclose the truth about the mysterious July 17, 1996, crash of T.W.A. Flight 800, which cost more than 200 people their lives?  Had the information this absorbing film presents played to a C.B.S. News audience, perhaps.  But when Borjesson pursued the story as a C.B.S. news producer and evidence pointed to U.S. Navy missiles as the cause of the tragedy, it may have been enough conflict of interest for then-C.B.S. owner Westinghouse, a nuclear power company and major defense contractor, to kill both the story and Borjesson's career at the television network.  Don't trust corporate news media.Finally, the journalist made T.W.A. FLIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED for the movie network EPIX.  I got rid of cable television a couple of years ago but don't recall hearing of that channel. Thank goodness this documentary found wider distribution, as I just got to view it on an Internet streaming service.So stunning is T.W.A.

While I was familiar with the tragedy (I read  Kristina Borjesson's book on censored news stories INTO THE BUZZSAW, for example), seeing testimony of those who witnessed the missiles taking down the plane in 1996 brings it home, smashing down the front door, no less.  As T.W.A.

It is one worry that this show will not live up to this momentum and trip into melodrama. Watching thisI felt like I was watching a movie far more then a tv show.Underneath I feel this show addresses the topic of a modern connected world and the loss of face to face social relations, who are we if you and 7 facebook friends you never met are stuck together in a blur of humanity that seems so self absorbed they are static to one's reality. It's not so much a deep thought as it is a seat for the ride this show seems to offer.",1391990400,2014-02-10
5.0,"the show returns with last year's dazzler (heather) augmented by the sunny and wonderful lydia. she shines like the sun itself and is unlike any housewife in the history of the franchise. maybe gretchen had the potential if life hadnt bitten her in the ass again and again (and she is now an even richer and more interesting character because of this so its not a dis) but really lydia is in a class by herself. people should aspire to be as warm, truthful and open as this fantastic addition.vicky seems at long last to have settled down and seems more comfortable in her skin although i wish she already knew that she was marvelous as she was and didnt need any surgical enhancement. even so, she feels better about herself and seems much more confident than she had in recent seasons. love her.last year, heather really elevated the show with her maniacal (charming) attempts to conform everything to perfection. people put her down for this but there is nothing wrong for aiming for and to be the absolute best and expecting ones husband to at least try to keep up. haha. to his credit, terry is also a fun part of the show as he tries to avoid heather's land mines.gretchen returns deeper and more interesting with her partner in crime (slade) not nearly as annoying in as he has been shown to be through creative editing in the past.tammra is less rotten than she was and seems to have finally figured out why she might have been so needlessly cutting in the past. her growth is interesting to watch.jesus crispy goofball pretense queen alexis is back with her smug for little reason husband, but they provide a nice contrast to the others and i dont hate watching them anymore. im hoping that alexis stops taking the Lord's name in vain (ie pretending that he is her personal excuse and cheerleader) and takes responsibility for previously seeming to be an immature scold with her own smugness.despite my harsh description, i dont hate them and dont mind them on the show as i have in the past. there is always room for the human condition to allow a dropping of the pretenses and a REAL come to jesus moment where they realize that they are better than nobody.anyhow, thats my take on this season. team lydia!",1370304000,2013-06-04

5.0,"I enjoyed season two.  Shocking end, but very well done.  I used to think only here in the USA that we had gangs, illegal guns, terrorists and good old fashion poverty, but this series is set in Toronto and shows human nature at its most vulnerable and that these human condition exist everywhere to one degree or another.The characters are very likable.  You see just enough of their private lives to be interesting and engage your interest without overwhelming the show.  Enrico Colantoni, is a spectacular actor and never disappoints no matter the role.  I have seen him in Veronica Mars, Just Shoot Me, and most recently in Person of Interest.  He is able to adapt to a role and make it believable.  Hugh Dillon is wonderful and David Paetkau is just plain HOT!  Where's the fan?  :)This is a police procedural with all the trimmings and well worth watching.",1401926400,2014-06-05

4.0,"While not bringing anything new to the bloated police procedural genre, featuring some shocking crimes and an unconventional protagonist, the BBC production Luther (2010-13), is an entertaining and engaging crime drama.  While not particularly credible, the singular exploits of Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) John Luther, make for an interesting and captivating watch, as Idris Elba (Pacific Rim,Obsessed) portrays the brilliant, but troubled and flawed investigator, who lives by his own set of rules.  As aspects of Luther's personal life become more entwined into the criminal investigations, a certain sense of predictability occurs, but there are still a number of twists and surprises along the way, that keep things lively.  Some spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.Series One (2010) contains six hour long episodes, the first opens with John Luther obtaining critical information from a serial killer, and then allowing him to fall, and become critically injured.  With the killer in a coma, Luther is in the clear for the moment, and is reinstated by his chief Rose Teller (Saskia Reeves), and assigned a new partner, Justin Ripley (Warren Brown).  His first case is the investigation of the murder of a husband and wife.  Luther suspects the couple's daughter Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson), and resorting to his accustomed illegal methods, obtains evidence of her guilt, but is unable to arrest her.In a continuing story arc, the relationship between Luther and Alice, two individuals with a twisted sense of morality, strangely evolves from adversarial, to a unique kind of friendship.  It's a weird transition that makes for an interesting fantasy, as Alice take an interest in John Luther's personal life, and his estranged wife Zoe (Indira Varma), who is living with another man.  Alice's intrusion, complicates what was already an emotionally charged situation.Dedicated to bringing criminals to justice, Luther is not adverse to bending the law, or outright breaking it, when he feels it is justified.  While allowances could be made for what he does in pursuit of ""justice"", other actions like covering up a murder, are less easy to excuse.  Luther is often a rousing and pulse-pounding drama, but one without much connection to reality.A highlight is definitely Episode 4, where man who drives a cab, is abducting and killing young women, then arranging the dead bodies on display.  It's been seen before, and the ending is not a complete surprise, but it's nicely presented, and bolstered by some excellent performances from Rob Jarvis as the killer, and Nicola Walker, as his wife.Series One comes to an explosive conclusion with Episodes 5 and 6, which have a connecting storyline.  A group of vicious thieves looking to recover some diamonds, are holding a woman hostage.  The situation is further complicated, because Luther's close friend is involved in the theft.  Things get very messy, innocents die, and Luther faces the darkest of tragedies.  Suspected of murder, and on the run, Luther enlists some unusual allies, as he attempts to clear his name.Journeying to some dark places, reality is out the door very early.  Some things may seem predictable, but the chances are that you will still want to see what happens, as Idris Elba's dynamic performance runs the emotional spectrum.  John Luther is an inscrutable fellow, highly intelligent but also impulsive, deceptive, and accustomed to employing violence as a solution.  He plays with fire, and sometimes gets very badly burned.  At the end, perhaps because he has so little left that he cares about, he's remarkably composed.The supporting cast, which also includes Dermot Crowley and Steven Macintosh, is top draw from top to bottom.  Sociopath Alice Morgan may be something of a genre clich&eacute;, but she is just one of several characters whose role evolves in a short period of time, an aspect that helps make the series interesting.  The Brits have had a taste for murder mysteries and gritty police procedurals for a very long time, and Luther makes a concerted effort to avoid being mundane.  For an American reference, if you are a fan of Criminal Minds, you may want to give Luther a look, particularly if you are a Prime member.",1374451200,2013-07-22

1.0,"I had high expectations for this series.However,  the first season episodes consistently fail to live up to their  potential.This is due in no small part to the awkward scripts.  There is very little substance here and far too much ""pouting""  and cartoonish posturing.Claire Holt is particularly annoying. She does not have the experience to overcome the infantile scripts. she does little more than pout her way through every scene.

Somehow watching a old guy getting blown up with all the kids watching was supposed to be funny.I found my self feeling bad for the kids being in a film like this.They take the shock value we see in movies like, wedding crashers oldschool and dodgeball. Then they put it in a movie with a bunch of little kids. Instead of adding in some funny inendo, or word plays, like the other films. They show hardcore porn, nudity, and really disturbing behavior.There is a line between funny, and WTF. They stayed firmly on the WTF side the entire film.",1349568000,2012-10-07

5.0,"This series is about siblings (two sisters and a brother) living separate lives in L.A., who are summoned to their father's house for a family dinner so that he can make an announcement.  Without giving anything away, this was a great start to what I think could be a fantastic series.  Each character has his or her own personal issues they are dealing with, but when they are all together it is such a joy to just watch them interact with each other.The casting was great, from recognizable actors/actresses (Jeffrey Tambor, Gaby Hoffman) to ones I was not familiar with, but who seem like perfect finds.  I think it will probably have a nice balance of humor, tugs at the heartstrings, and cringe-worthy moments.I could easily imagine this as an HBO, Showtime, or Netflix series.  It has that premium cable quality that I've come to expect from those networks.  The closest comparison I can think of is Six Feet Under, which is one of my all time favorite TV series.  No surprise, since the creator of Transparent was a writer on Six Feet Under.If you are a fan of family* dramas/dramedies (ex: Six Feet Under, United States of Tara, Shameless), or just dramas/dramedies in general (Orange is the New Black, Enlightened) you would probably like this show.*By family, I do not mean family-friendly: this has mature content, including sex, language, and nudity.

3.0,"Well, what the show needs is Kono back in Hawaii with the team. I think the case was better this episode, but I fear the peripheral stuff will limit how good the show will be. I still maintain that the core four, Kono, Chin, Danny and Steve should be the focus, it is a winning combination. I'd like to see more attention paid to writing good-great cases, and less time spent on relationships and outlying characters. Having characters show up and add to the case is a good thing, having characters show up and detract from the case... sorry not a fan of it. This is a cop show! Concentrate on that. The formula of the team, and a good case.... wins.Updating this review. I am very puzzled by the way the show has become Catherine centric. She is being portrayed as the star of the show. Does that mean we are going to see less of Kono and Danny? are they going to be eliminated? I feel pretty cheated by the loss of the central team. I don't like turning on what was one of my favorite shows and seeing Steve's girlfriend is the hub now and everything is revolving around her.",1380931200,2013-10-05

3.0,"This show has a few things going for it. Piper Perabo (playing the principle character: 'Annie' Walker) is very sexy, and the producers aren't afraid to show her in some sexy clothing and poses that make me... Christopher Gorham (playing 'Augie' Anderson) is also quite sexy (for the ladies) and once again the revealing outfits and workout scenes are abundant. The costumes, locations, sets and props are superb. It's a very stylish show, with high production value. The music (especially the title track by Flint Eastwood) is killer and the overall production value superb.  The problem with this show? The writing; specifically the portrayal of the CIA (and other intelligence agencies). The show routinely shows CIA agents conducting covert ops inside the U.S., targeting U.S. persons for ops, breaking various laws, acting in irresponsible and illegal ways. Their interaction with other intelligence agencies is always competitive, antagonistic and marked by direct competition. The ignorance (or is it disinformation?) regarding U.S. intelligence agencies (do five minutes of research on Google, why don't you?!) is disturbing, insulting, and distracting. The acting ranges from fair to downright abysmal - If Christopher Gorham is supposed to play a blind person why is he constantly dodging furniture, doorways and objects directly in his path? Is the director awake during the shoot? I don't think I'll make it beyond season two. It's fun to watch for a season or two (I saw season one as well), but ultimately this show will run out of steam.",1389139200,2014-01-08

The whiney wife is still a cast member but she has finally seemed to have learned her place as the cheating cow she is. Perhaps now the Sheriffs son might actually survive and is becoming quite the real man that he has to be under the circumstances.I just can't wait until the scriptwriters find a way to write out the mewly wife entirely eliminating her histrionics as well as an original cast members salary.

I was sad to see the CI series end , SVU still in production with major role changes and lets not forget the original 20 seasons of Law & Order which is my next purchase. Great to have in your library. You can watch them over and over a catch something you missed. Well Done great that Amazon has them available.",1376438400,2013-08-14
1.0,"OK. I don't get it. I really gave this a shot but, after watching the very first episode I have officially given up on this one. The premise of an invisible dome covering a town is OK but cutting a cow in half was ridiculous. As soon as that happened I knew it was over. It's not that any of the things  that happened in the show couldn't happen but it's just that everything was so cheezy. I give up on this one. The special effects don't cut it and the acting is ""so-so"". I'm digging under the dome and escaping.",1373414400,2013-07-10
4.0,"""This is important, there is no room for mistakes."" When A bio-tech company is looking for someone to get a test animal for them they turn to Martin (Dafoe). After traveling to Tasmania for his job he meets a young girl named Sass and her family. The family begins to change the way he feels about the job, but the company sends constant reminders. This is another very surprising movie. When it boils down to it the movie is pretty much about poaching...but it is so much more. The movie is very heartfelt and surprisingly emotional. While also being a little depressing the movie is very much worth watching. Dafoe is great in this movie and I have to say that even though the movie doesn't sound interesting this is a very good movie and will not disappoint. There really isn't that much I can say about this. Between his hunt for the tiger and his helping the family this is a movie that really shows Martin's struggle with his job and his conscience. I recommend this. Overall, a emotional and depressing hunting movie that is worth a watch. I give it an A-.",1335916800,2012-05-02
4.0,An excellent show with a very good cast.  The world has been invaded with bad aliens and most humans have died.  Many good twist and turns are keeping you guessing and now the good aliens may or may not be the answer to their prayers.  We'll have to wait for season 4.,1381622400,2013-10-13

4.0,"funny thing. My brother's been trying to get me to watch this show forever. As it turns out, I get the videos of the day, everyday, and one was Charlie Day giving the commencement speech at his alma mater, Merrimack college in New Hampshire. it was then I realized that its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, was his show, and he's from New Hampshire where I'm from also.of course, this is what prompted me to actually start watching the show. I really enjoy it, it almost seems unscripted. The best part is, it's on Amazon Prime for free. How can you beat that!",1401494400,2014-05-31
2.0,"While the animation and voice acting is fairly, there needs to be a small bit more development in the plot and character. It's great the main character tries to learn and figure out how to do things, but there needs to be more ''meat'' behind it.",1366416000,2013-04-20

3.0,"I haven't watched TV since 2007 and only watch DVD's. I have to go by product description (for anything new) and this sounded pretty good. It's not a bad show. Although I could do without the bad language and showing people retching. (That's not entertaining to me and I want to be entertained.)  The main character talks a little too fast so I have to back up the subtitles to see what was said. But overall it isn't too bad a show.  I enjoy the 2 main characters (Jim and the Medical Examiner). Good chemistry and good for a few laughs in between the drama. Sorry to say that for me, personally, it isn't anything to get overly excited about but it's not too bad a show. I will more than likely buy the second season. It was entertaining enough. I would probably rate it at least 3 1/2 stars, almost to 4 stars.",1360281600,2013-02-08
5.0,The acting and story are very interesting. Bosch's moral dilemma from the shooting combined with his empathy for the victim at the newly discovered crime scene is powerful.

I get a number of errors about playing multiple videos at the same time which I am not and on occasion the HD delivery doesn't seem to be the highest quality.

5.0,The Unit season 4 has really up'ed the ante for a secret military action packed series.  I have not always cared for the wives part in the series but was amazed with a well put together series that showed their intelligence and &#34;stand by your man&#34; character.  It got a 5 star rating because it produced a solid written story that was interesting and amusing. It caused me to become addicted to what happens next.  A great series you won't want to miss.,1399593600,2014-05-09
3.0,"Falling Skies started to take a turn for the worse in season 3 with the subplot of Anne's freaky baby. That the baby was ""different"" could have been shown subtly and without making it silly (the whole dismal mess reminded me of Chucky from theChild's Play (1988)film franchise). Season 4 starts with a dramatic attack by the Espheni, thinning out the ranks of our ragtag crew of heroes. A divide and conquer strategy is put into place by the fishheads, and the Volm are not in much of a position to help the human protagonists. Both context and gaping plot holes are established quickly in the first episode of s4.The one thing season 4 has going for it so far is that an Espheni overlord suggests to Tom that overwhelming threats greater than the Espheni are coming to Earth. This is a theme in sci-fi that tends to work well. Your once most feared enemy starts to look like a puppy dog when compared to a bigger and badder foe that rolls into town. Take for example the Scarrans inFarscape: Complete Series, who made the Peacekeepers look like the Boy Scouts upon their entrance into the series.I am worried about the health of this serial due to the emphasis on Alexis the Supernatural, who is more fitting as one of Fox Mulder's cases than a character on the now classic Falling Skies. The special effects and the potential of meeting yet another race of aliens is currently keeping me watching s4 every week.",1404777600,2014-07-08

3.0,"I won't write you a &#34;book&#34; on this one, others have already done that. This was one well done series, in just about any aspect. Well written, it even &#34;looked&#34; good- unlike the typical SYFY Saturday movie. I always wondered why religion came into the plot line the last couple of seasons, negatively portrayed at that, but maybe the writers were running out of material. Well written even if you don't like the subject matter sometimes, or the enemy ( I &#34;liked&#34; the Goa'uld- seasons 1-8, better than the Ori- 9-10, and even then the stories had something to them.Start at the beginning of the series, not the end, and always be sure to watch the extras each season.This was the best of the three Stargate series.",1355702400,2012-12-17

They find shortly after moving in that the place is haunted by a female ghost who was murdered by her fiance.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good paranormal story line.  I thoroughly enjoy this series and hope there are many more seasons to come.  Good writing and character development.

3.0,"I read the books so I will give the season a chance. My wife, however, is done. She fell asleep about half way in and I don't blame her. If I hadn't read the books I wouldn't watch it. How can they F this up, seriously? The actors are sooooooo boring and dull (except for the excellent old hunter and the Wishmaster (whom they already killed)). It seemed like 80% of this episode was exposition about personal relations. I pray to God they use practical effects instead of just CGI (unlikely) because the &#34;monster&#34; looked like it was the same one from about 100 other CGI ghost/monster movies. The minute CGI shows up it disconnects me from the story; it looks cartoonish.I had high hopes, so heres praying they turn it around and make it exciting.Seriously, when they were showing the teasers for the series,  they had one with just shadows, a tapping cane, and little candies being tossed, along with some music, that GAVE ME CHILLS! That creepy feeling/terror is the atmosphere they need to find again.",1405296000,2014-07-14

4.0,"Season three opens, with Gibbs going after Kate's killer, Ari. And to try to throw alot at us, NCIS gets a new director, Jenny Shepard played by Lauren Holly. Now Shepard and Gibbs do have some history, since both were partners at NCIS at one time, also. To proclaim Ari's innocence, is Massade officer Ziva David. And I'm sorry, I didn't like her then. And I don't liker her now, She and pretty much all of Massad is built up like they are the only agents that are extremely tough, they're unstoppable. So Ziva and Jenny try to convince Gibbs that he's wrong, and Gibbs even makes the only logical argument against Ari's innocence. That if he were innocent, he would turn himself in. So, after much arguing, he gets Ziva to follow him. And Ziva kills Ari in Gibb's basement, And we get each persons view of how they saw Kate in this episode. Now, I would have inserted Paula Cassidy to the team after this. Since there was some obvious chemistry between her and tony, but no. We get Ziva, and she is built up like I said. As this unstoppable, lean mean killing machine. The best of the best, and I'm sorry, but she's abrasive and annoying. And I still have a hard time accepting her to the team, Gibbs magically trusts her more than any other member of the team. season three is a good season, and Ziva is the on;y reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Although season three does end with almost getting blown up, going into a coma. Waking up from that coma, and thinking it's 1991. And we get to meet Gibbs's mentor, Mike Franks. Which leads to gibbs trying to stop a terrorists attack. Only the generals won't allow it, and Gibbs ends up Quitting NCIS. All in all, season three is still awsome. Like I said before, my only problem is Ziva. The introduction of a new director, and then Gibbs leaving.",1346976000,2012-09-07
4.0,"I recently watched MTV's TEEN WOLF: SEASON 1 and TEEN WOLF: SEASON 2. You could say it was a lonnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggg Teen Wolf marathon. (lol) For a MTV show...it's not THAT bad. (lol) Apparently it's based on the Michael J. Fox movie, TEEN WOLF but instead of the high school `teen wolf' playing basketball in the movie...well...in the TV series he plays lacrosse. While watching it - I realized it's a teen, comedy, drama MTV show. (lol) Lets just say my wife's not a fan of this show...but it's ok because I ammmmmmmmm. (lol)In season 1 - you meet Scott and the crew. Everyone seems normal until Scott played by Tyler Posey gets bite by a wolf...soon he becomes...TEEN WOLF. So now he has to deal with THAT...high school...his lacrosse team...and his new high school crush on Allison Argent, who's played by the sexy and beautiful Crystal Reed. Stiles (from the movie) played by Dylan O'Brien is Scott's best friend and crazy sidekick. He's all in love with Lydia Martin who's played by the sexy red head Holland Roden. She's the popular `mean girl' of the school who happens to be dating the captain of the lacrosse team...douche bag Jackson played by Colton Haynes (Arrow). Then we meet lone wolf Derek Hale played by Tyler Hoechlin. He's searching for the one who killed his sister - - he's got his own wolf problems to deal but soon meets Scott and well...it gets a little crazy. (lol)In season 2 - all hell breaks loose. EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE has their problems. (lol) Scott's having to deal with high school drama, other werewolves, hunters...YES. Hunters who wanna kill werewolves, some lizard creature (which is kind of cool) - kind of reminded me of something you'd see in SPIDERMAN and there's a lot more. (lol)THERE SURE IS A LOT OF `SHIRTS OFF' IN THIS SERIES...so ladies. If you've never watched a TEEN WOLF episode...ya might wanna check it out. (lol) I think it's a fun and entertaining watch. Plus Crystal Reed's dimples and Holland Roden are good to the eyes. (lol) The Season 2 3-disc DVD has some cool features. On disc 1 - you can watch the TEEN WOLF Season 2 at Paleyfest 2012 event. It's a pretty cool Q&A; with the cast. On disc 2 - there's the CGI and fight reels...pretty cool stuff and on disc 3 you can watch the gag reel, ""Meet the new wolf pack battlefield"" and for the ladies...SHIRTLESS MONTAGE 2.0 (lol) There's other stuff on the discs...you just gotta pick what you like.

5.0,"I find Haunted Collector a refreshing alternative to the Ghost Hunter, Paranormal State and Ghost Adventures. Because most of them deal with the ghost or spirit directly where the Haunted Collector tries to find a source of the haunting. I find it very enlightening to have them discover objects that are truly haunted. It teaches us many things about how our body's have energy that can transfer to objects or stay in a space. Its not always a direct haunting as many of these items I think create a residual haunting. But never less the Haunted Collector does his best to solve the haunting for his client. This is a very professionaland get down to business show. They do not try and hype it up or make it more then what it is.

4.0,"""This is where the rubber of government meets the actual road of human beings."" Or not.Being produced by the same people as the gutsplitting ""The Office"" gives mockumentary/comedy ""Parks and Recreation"" a lot to live up to. Fortunately its first season is a solid little intro to a promising series -- the first couple episodes are a bit scattershot comically, but it really takes off by the middle of the season. And Amy Poehler is nothing short of amazing.Ambitious Leslie Knopes (Poehler) is a middle-level, rather clueless manager in the Parks and Recreation department. When a nurse named Amy Perkins (Rashida Jones) tells her of a vast abandoned pit that caused her loutish boyfriend Andy to break both his legs, Leslie smells an opportunity.Her goal: fill in the pit and turn it into a nice little park ""even if it takes two months"" (as Amy puts it). So she forms a little committee including Ann, the cynical, lecherous Tom (Aziz Ansari), her indifferent crush (and onetime fling) Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), and perpetually bored college intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza); their committee is overseen by anti-government government official Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman).Unfortunately, they have some problems on the way: Attempts to canvass supporters go awry when Leslie ends up alienating a bunch of people, and Pawnee Journal reporter gets ahold of some very unflattering information about the project (including that Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit). Then Leslie's attempts to get some clout at her mother's award ceremony go painfully awry (along with her fashion sense), and trying to join the boys' club leads to an alcohol scandal courtesy of the wine-guzzling April. And Andy's first post-cast rock concert is disrupted by love life problems that lead to a nasty breakup.""Parks and Recreation"" takes a couple of episodes to warm up to its full comic potential, since the first couple episodes are sort-of-funny-but-not-hilarious, and sprinkled with mockumentary dialogue. Halfway through, the writers really hit their stride, and the show becomes very funny.It's got the mockumentary mix of awkward situations (Leslie and an embarrassed Ann being mistaken for lesbians) and weird dialogue delivered with a straight face (""I'd go to a banquet in honor of those Somali pirates if they served bacon wrapped shrimp"").  And it's got lots of hilarious jokes that are played absolutely straight at all times, such as the macabre and disturbing historical murals that fill the town hall (""That's the great thing about Indians back then -- they used every part of the pioneer""). You don't see most of them coming (example: a pro-park person who is gradually revealed to be a sicko pervert).Amy Poehler is absolutely brilliant as Leslie, a clueless but kind woman, who vastly overestimates her own importance and that of local government. Sometimes Leslie crosses the line between naive and dumb, but Poehler makes her likable and passionately conscientious. And she can say the weird stuff (""To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises"") with a straight face.She also has a very good supporting cast, particularly Jones as the straight-woman who is just immersing herself in the world of politics, Chris Pratt as the lazy Andy, and the deliciously barbed woman-chaser Tom. But some of the characters aren't really fleshed out in full -- April has no dimensions beyond bored snotty teen, and Mark only really gets some good development in the last episode.""Parks and Recreation: Season One"" starts off rather slow for a few episodes, but it has plenty of promise and loads of funny (""This is a childrens slide. You're not allowed to sleep here""). And it shows signs of getting really, really good.",1250121600,2009-08-13

Acting was OK; not great but passable. Moves a bit slow and flash-backs help to clarify some of the disjointedness.

4.0,"I just finished watching this movie, I thought it was fairly good, but I was not planning on writing a review until I came here and read some of the negative reviews (I like to read reviews after watching a movie to see what other people thought). After reading the negative reviews I have a desire to respond briefly to the two major complaints that people seemed to have with the movie, 1) that it was boring, and 2) that the character arc of Willem Dafoe's character was not believable. Before I respond to those critiques, however, my conscience forces me to provide at least a brief summary of the movie and why I thought it was worth watching, in order to justify the fact that I am writing a review at all.The movie is about a hunter, played by Willem Dafoe, who is hired by a corporation to track down the last remaining Tasmanian Tiger in order to retrieve its DNA, and possibly a toxin that it uses to subdue or kill its prey. Dafoe's character is a loner, but when in Tasmania he is forced to stay with a family. The mother of the family is distraught over the recent disappearance of her husband and spends all her time sleeping, but Dafoe interacts with her two children, a daughter and a son. The movie moves back and forth between scenes with Dafoe on his own in the woods trying to track the Tasmanian Tiger, and scenes with him interacting with the family. There is also a conflict between environmentalists, who are attempting to get a ban placed on logging in the area, and the loggers who are threatened with unemployment if the environmentalists succeed. Dafoe's character gets caught in the middle of the conflict because the loggers take him to be a ""greenie"".That is a basic description of what the movie is about, and I must admit, when I read the description the movie did not sound all that exciting to me. The movie managed, however, to hold my interest once I started watching. This is not an action movie, there are not a lot of tense action sequences. In fact, there are none. That may be why so many people thought the movie was boring. If you are looking for a Rambo style action flick than I would definitely recommend taking a pass on this movie. There are other things besides action, however, that make a movie interesting and engaging, and this movie does a good job at setting up a number of mysteries that hook in the viewer. What happened to the father who disappeared? Who is responsible for setting up the camera, and other hanging objects, in the woods? Is there really still a Tasmanian Tiger out there, or is it really extinct? There is also the whole conflict between the environmentalists and the loggers which threatens to explode and creates tension in the movie. And, of course, there is the heart of the movie: Dafoe's relationship with the family, and especially the kids. All in all, I would not consider this to be one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it certainly held my interest, and it was a lot better than most of the movies that get made these days.Now I will try to quickly respond to the two complaints. I have already responded, to some degree, to the first complaint that the film is boring. The pace of the movie is slow, that is undeniable. If you do not like slow paced movies than you should not watch this one. But like I said, there is plenty in the movie that is capable of grabbing and holding the viewer's interest despite its lack of action packed car chases.The second complaint that everyone seems to have with this movie is that Dafoe's character arc is not believable. This complaint was made not only by reviewer's here on amazon, but also by professional reviewers on the site Rotten Tomatoes. I find this complaint somewhat puzzling because it seems to me to be based on a false premise. I think people find the character arc unbelievable because they make the character's transformation more extreme than it really is. They often talk as if Dafoe's character at the beginning of the movie was an evil loner, perhaps an assassin type character, and that at the end of the movie he is a fully reformed character. There is, however, as far as I can tell nothing in the movie that would suggest that Dafoe's character at the beginning of the movie is in any way ""evil"", unless you assume that anyone who is willing to work for a corporation, or anyone who hunts for a living is ""evil"". There is also no indication that the character is a saint by the end of the movie. SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT READ PAST THIS SENTENCE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE ENDING REVEALED.In fact, the character still kills the Tasmanian Tiger once he finds it. The character does, however, refuse to give the remains to the corporation, and I read one review by a professional critic who considered that completely unbelievable. I do not think there is anything unbelievable about it at all. The company that Dafoe's character was working for had just murdered the woman he was staying with, along with her daughter, or, it is at least clear that Dafoe believes that the corporation was responsible for their deaths (he says to Sam Neill's character ""they just sent a replacement for me...""). What would have been unbelievable is if Dafoe's character had been so heartless as to continue working for his previous employers once it became clear they were willing to murder innocent people to get what they wanted. There is nothing in the set up of Willem Dafoe's character which would suggest that he is fine with killing innocent people.I just do not think that the character transformation is as large as these critics are assuming. There is, of course, a character transformation, but I think it is from someone who is extremely solitary to someone who begins to show a minimal interest in other people's lives. That is not really a giant leap in my opinion. I think Dafoe's transformation is entirely believable given the circumstances (I apologize that I keep referring to the character by using the name of the actor but I am too lazy to look up the character name). It would be hard to stay with a family whose father/husband had just gone missing and not feel some sympathy, especially for the children. You would have to be inhuman not to, and like I said, there is no reason to believe that Dafoe's character is inhuman at the beginning of the movie or incapable of human sympathy. The fact that he spends his time listening to opera suggests that he is a human being who is quite capable of feeling genuine human emotions. He is not a sociopath. So, contrary to what so many people seem to think, I do not find anything unbelievable in the character arc of Willem Dafoe's character. Personally, I do not think that ""realism"" should be the primary ideal of art. What would be the point of an art-work that was just a carbon copy of reality? I did not, however, see anything in this movie that I thought stretched the bounds of believability beyond a reasonable point. In fact, I would say this is probably one of the more realistic movies I have ever seen. Certainly much more realistic than most Hollywood blockbusters.Whether you will like this movie will, however, depend on your tastes.",1346716800,2012-09-04
5.0,"This was very well done. When I saw the page with the five pilots, it's the one I definitely wanted to see first, and I like what I saw.We need quality science-fiction series, and sadly there are so few of them out there, so it's great to see Chris Carter getting back to business with what I hope Amazon will order as a series, it certainly has potential for it.As a Frenchman, I was surprised and delighted to see that the main role - or certainly the one that stands out the most as the central figure in the group - is played by a French actress, Louise Monot, whom I had very much enjoyed in 'OSS 117: Rio ne r&eacute;pond plus' (a cult French comedy). She is pretty great in this as well, as are all the other cast members (always nice to see Adrian Pasdar), whose characters are well defined already, there is no weak link.The hour flew by and I want more. I assume Chris Carter will have carte blanche to delve into a complex story without the restraints he might have had on a broadcast network.

Where in h#@@ (pun intended) did they get these actors from - some community college acting class?  Except for Terry O', the acting was beyond awful.  And so badly cast that it made me laugh out loud several times.  Then there's the writing; wow, I don't recall hearing such mundane lines in a long time.  Actors walk into a room several times and ask, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;  What are you watching?&#34;  Are you kidding me?  There's no other way to evoke curiosity?  The sets were so fake, it was fascinating.  And if you are going to use CGI badly, don't use it at all.  The plot, at times, held promise, but that quickly disintegrated in a series of laughable twists.

5.0,"As a series that honors its origins without ever being merely imitative of them, this may well turn out to be one of the all time great television spin-offs. Indeed, the very term ""spin-off"" seems somehow inadequate. For this is a true sequel, and one fully up to the task of standing on equal terms with its predecessor.A lifetime has passed between the ending of Avatar and the beginning of Korra, and in that time the world of the four nations has moved on. Even during the scope of the original series, we saw that world in a state of technological ferment. In the time between the two series, this process has clearly marched on unabated. By the time Korra begins, we find ourselves in a world with technology comparable to early 20th century Earth.To those who fell in love with the world of the first series, I'd say only this: don't worry, for there is nothing to fear here. The  writers have not destroyed or replaced their original creation. Rather, they have profoundly deepened it. There is the sense of a real world with its own internal logic and course of development - a world that changes precisely because of its own reality. Integral to this is the fact that it's not just the technology that has moved forwards. Everything from the society's economic basis to its martial arts has changed since last we were here, but always in logical and internally consistent ways. You can tell that this is a show made by people with a deep respect for the integrity of their own creation.As with the original series, this logical and consistent quality - this ability to just plain think things through - applies not only to the world-building, but also to the plot and story. At all times we have the sense of a tapestry being woven. Even when we don't quite know where all the threads are heading, or what dark warp in the weave is yet to surface, we  instinctively know that _something_ is happening. Something we can't help but get caught up in and want to follow.Fittingly for an animated show, the world, the story, and all its many moods are communicated to us in large part through the art. At all times we know we're in the same world we were first introduced to in the original Avatar series. There are no sharp breaks here. However, in keeping with the early 20th century feel of this new era, the coloring is significantly more subdued. On a concrete level this manifests in such details as the sepia hues of early photography and the drabness of industrial landscapes. But it is also used to convey the sense that the world we are visiting is now a murkier place, one where the true nature of the threats faced is significantly less clear than it was in the original series. It is a tempting if imperfect metaphor to cast this show asThe Empire Strikes Backof the Avatar universe.I also find that I cannot let this review go by without mentioning the background music. As with the original series, this is composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, and is once again superb. It is both beautiful in its own right and integral to how the show's creators communicate with us as an audience. It speaks to us of the nature of the world we find ourselves in, of the story we are following, and again, of all the many moods that this story takes. And it not only speaks: it speaks eloquently.There is so much more to say here, but I'm going to cut myself down to two final observations.First, Andrea Romano, whom I shall forever think of asHawkgirl, lends her considerable talents to the voice direction. One never knows quite how much credit should go to a director and how much to the actors. But when everyone just plays off each other perfectly, you've got to figure that a significant slice of the credit should go to the director. Props to you, Andrea.Second, one of the things I've loved the most about this series is how, in the character of Avatar Korra, we do have the sense that at the core, this is the same person we were first introduced to as Avatar Aang: even though that person is now manifesting through a very different personality.This is far and away the best thing Nickelodeon has done in years. It is the kind of show that both children and adults can enjoy. But unlike so many shows that wind up being described in such terms, it is not ""multi-layered"" in the straightforward sense that there are some things that the less sophisticated viewers will miss entirely. Rather, its generation-spanning appeal stems from far more basic strengths: a well thought out story, real emotional depth, and compelling characters; to say nothing of meticulous world-building coupled with wonderfully lyrical art and background music.That, in the end, is why both children and adults will love The Legend of Korra.Theo.",1350000000,2012-10-12

5.0,"So many writers and filmmakers have tried and so few have succeeded in portraying the tectonic plate shift of values in England at the close of WWI. Parade's End is one that succeeded brilliantly in that portrayal, thanks in part to the atmosphere of Ford Madox Brown's novel and the filmmakers' adherence to it. As a cultural historian, I usually find fault with period films: costuming, speech, etc. Parade's End, as near as I can make out, is flawless. This is a moving and memorable mini-series that deserves every accolade.  The acting is first-rate, the settings are meticulously reconstructed, the people and events will stay with you long after the series is done.",1395705600,2014-03-25

While this show does the same thing, they don't do it as well.These Texas people do bring some different elements to the show. They more likely to bid low and keep low on their bids on lockers.

Most of the best shows and movies of all times have had neither and can stand on the strength of the creativity of their writers. I did not feel that either contributed to or was needed to develop the characters or story.That said, I really enjoyed the premise, suspense, and mystery. I hope it continues. If the writing goes towards continuous foul language and gratuitous nudity and sex then I will have to bow out. Considering the amount in entertainment at this time it is nothing novel.

3.0,"A sci-fi movie &#8220;Europa Report&#8221; follows the &#8220;Europa One&#8221; mission that goes wrong &#8211; a privately-funded mission to Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, to find extraterrestrial life forms. Being a found-footage film, &#8220;Europa Report&#8221; tells the story of six astronauts, using images of head cameras and monitor cameras in a spaceship, as well as talking heads scenes.The film is very unique and ambitious in its effort to stick to realism, using the found-footage format that has become very familiar to us. While the method manages to visually enhance the reality of the film, especially its claustrophobic atmosphere, it inevitably makes the film reliant on dialogues that are often heavy and not always interesting.But I think the biggest problem is the film&#8217;s storyline itself. The idea of a privately-funded spaceship travelling to discover the evidence of extraterrestrial life is not something that I can believe, especially when the film makes almost no effort to make us care the characters and their mission. Why should we, if they find something or not? Also, the film&#8217;s jumbled timeline does not help.Of course, I see the point of the film, a science fiction movie that is scientifically accurate. Unfortunately, accuracy alone could be very boring.",1398297600,2014-04-24

2.0,"There are a handful of directors who have created such buzz surrounding their distinct voices that there is talk about them, their films and their methods with every film, before, after and even long after he&#8217;s moved on to something else.  Lars von Trier is probably the king of this.  Since his start in the early 90&#8217;s, von Trier has graced audiences (small audiences, but audiences) with his perverse and often shocking depictions of sexuality, sexism and masochism.  Sometimes, he finds ways to shade his own ideas, philosophies, theories and musings with enough style and depth to make them feel warranted, making the shock of it all carry the weight it needs to sit on our palate.And then other times he just shows us a lot of pictures of genitals and expects us to feel something other than repulsion.Now, I&#8217;ve been a longstanding champion of von Trier and his vision.  While others have tossed many disparaging remarks his way and have taken arms against some of his more recent films, I&#8217;ve stood my ground and played devil&#8217;s advocate in his favor.  &#8216;Antichrist&#8217; was a pretty disturbing film, but when all was said and done there was an underlying purpose to von Trier&#8217;s madness, and while it didn&#8217;t all translate how he would have liked (or at least how the audience would have liked) there is no denying that von Trier had a pretty bold narrative and some pretty confident points to entertain, and the core performance from Charlotte Gainsbourg was astonishingly grounded in the context of the film (such a fearless performance, through and through).I can&#8217;t defend this.&#8216;Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 & 2&#8217; is basically a four hour film that recounts a young woman&#8217;s many, many, many sexual trysts.  Pretending to exploit (here we go again with exploitation in film) the double standard that abounds within the treatment of men and women, especially in a sexual context, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; confuses all of its own ideals in a strange hodgepodge of &#8216;chapters&#8217; that drone on and on and ultimately take us nowhere.  Opening with a beaten young woman named Joe being helped off the street by the neighborhood psychiatrist, Seligman, and then delving into the depths of carnal lusting and abuse, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; is probably one of the most self-absorbed and self-indulgent films I&#8217;ve ever had the displeasure of seeing.I think that Lars von Trier has a deep-seated interest in uncovering the depths of a woman&#8217;s psyche.  I don&#8217;t think that he is a misogynist at all.  In fact, I tend to side with Uma Thurman on this subject:&#8220;He&#8217;s a very provocative filmmaker, but he writes women with more depth and respect and complexity than most writers.  The idea that people debate whether he&#8217;s a misogynist?  People should debate whether people who don&#8217;t even write women are misogynist.  The fact is, he&#8217;s dedicated a large portion of his artistic life to the exploration of the female psyche&#8212;good and bad, light and dark, shadows, textures.  The fact that he&#8217;s dedicated a huge part of his talents to that, to me, defies the concept that he doesn&#8217;t have respect, interest, and genuine compassion in women.  People should question writers that don&#8217;t even give a d*** about a female character.  They are the misogynists.&#8221;Sadly, this respect and intrigue isn&#8217;t seen very well here at all.  Instead, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; feels about as misogynist as they come, and at the end of the day it&#8217;s even worse than that; the film feels just plain trashy.  Lars von Trier has built a career out of shock value, but his shocking contributions to film have always felt grounded in a linier plot or at least in an idea that has sprouted into madness, but a clear idea at the core.  Most of &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; feels nonsensical and devoid of rational narrative, and while he tries to find some footing in the film&#8217;s final throws, he never establishes anything concrete within Joe&#8217;s story to hook us to her, to latch onto us and so it all winds up feeling rather misguided.There is a point here, but von Trier doesn&#8217;t know what it is.Instead, von Trier treats us to a young girl&#8217;s dissention into depravity.  She prostitutes herself for sexual pleasure at a very young age, playing games with her best friend and even forming a club that&#8217;s primary focus was to rack up sexual partners, never forming a lasting relationship with anyone (no one lay to be repeated), and Joe recounts her story with absolutely no emotion, as if none of it matters (because it doesn&#8217;t) and Seligman tries to liken her whorish behavior to numbers and fish while she relates it all to her dying father and an ash tree; and while Joe is pretending she&#8217;s falling in love with Shia LaBeouf (because that could never happen for real), volume 1 ends and volume 2 begins and this is where things get dicey.  Sexual pleasure is lost, which leads to Joe finding her own personal Fight Club and hiring translators to hook her up with Africans and before we know it, Joe has become a Soprano and is grooming a freaky eared nymph to take her place, and her man.And then Seligman takes off his pants.There is so much going on here and yet none of it ever feels necessary.  It is all just there to make your eyes hurt (they will hurt) and the film&#8217;s primary point seems to center on how Joe&#8217;s disturbing actions are all validated because men are disgusting pigs and she is living in the repressed guilt of her of desires, but it&#8217;s not that simple and yet von Trier never steps back from his own visual shockfest long enough to try and actually develop these themes.  Instead he&#8217;d rather show us a bunch of genitalia and sexual acts and then force feed us a finale that feels appropriate ONLY because the film pretty much sets us up for a cop-out ending.There is such a thing as being bold and fearless, and &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; is both of those things, but it is also soulless and hollow, and when you are both of THOSE things, bold and fearless will only harm you.",1395964800,2014-03-28
3.0,"""Arbitrage"" has enough tension and intrigue to carry you through even its rather draggy middle portions. It's a pretty decent corporate thriller that convincingly shows the inner workings of a big New York investment firm. It has its share of surprises and skillfully makes use of subtle details (ex: the license plate photos). Nevertheless, it lacks the climactic punch it seems to promise. When the credits started rolling, I thought ""Huh? That's IT?!""It's not Gere's finest performance: his character's a bit wooden at times. Still, though I don't generally like billionaire CEO types who cheat on their wives, the storyline and script made me care what happened to him even though a big part of me didn't particularly want to care.

5.0,"The Hour, Season 1, is one of the best few hours on TV each week. Set in Britain amid the Suez crisis of 1956, The Hour is the name of a BBC news program with a lot of reporting restrictions on it, due to the conservative politics and Cold War at the time, that still tries to be valuable to viewers and maintain integrity.Bel Rowley is the heroine of the show, played by Romola Garai, a career woman who makes many mis-steps but whose heart is in the right place. Her best friend Freddie gets put on the team, but not as the heroic front man in the camera's eye, but rather the writer, researcher and eventual investigator of a series of deaths all linked to the Suez crisis. Everything seems harmless enough on the surface of this world, but nothing is ever at is appears, and many people are not either. Freddie's anchor man place is supplanted by gorgeous but dully English Hector Madden (played superbly by Dominic West, McNulty of The Wire).  Hector is talentless and brainless, but with all the right connections through his wealthy father-in-law. He should be the hero of the piece, but it is humble intellectual Freddie who manages to steal his thunder every time.  Hector's wife Marnie (Oona Chaplin, grandaughter of Charlie, daughter of Geraldine) is even more of a twit than he is, with revolting double-standards and a cattiness that would put any alley cat to shame.  Brief guest appearances by Tim Piggot-Smith, Juliet Stevenson and Andrew Scott make this a series not to miss. Other standouts are Anna Chancellor as the embittered Lix, who supports all her colleagues as they rampage through London and the english countryside in a race against time to find out the truth and nothing but, even if they will never be allowed to broadcast it.This is the BBC at its best; you might want to watch the episodes more than once so that you get all the details of what is going on. This is so tightly plotted that if you blink, you might miss something!",1375747200,2013-08-06

4.0,"The approach is effective and takes ancient and biblical archeology out the classrooms and sterile digs into an almost realistic view of ancient life.

Having been personally involved in a cops life I understand the language they use, but I don't like it. I would wish that it did not have to be a part of every show that comes out now.It was a little slow to start but built interest and ended this pilot well. Based on the overwhelming 5-star reviews I'm sure you'll keep it going. The only thing that keeps me from 5-star also is the language, especially the use of God's name inappropriately. I live in the real world and I have to deal with it every day.

But, and maybe because this was a pilot, I felt that the story kind of got lost in the premise. I watched the interview with the show`s creator and he seemed a little more interested in what the show could do for getting kids interested in science rather than telling a story. I`m sure kids will like the show, but without good writing I think the only thing that would keep them interested is good visual effects and cool technologies exhibited on the show.

Funny and dramatic, without being melodramatic is rare and often a failure; but they pull this off with style. The characters, of which there are a multitude are so well crafted that their similarities become melded into a casting that demands each get its time to develop and interact in a fashion that can only be discribed as growth; like a real person grows within a family, and like a family grows together and apart.

(Not true to the books) And Sherlock as a recovering drug addict, while true to the story, came off a bit tame.  But after watching the first two shows I was hooked. Elementary is somewhat less about Sherlock being a know-it-all than the other Sherlock Holmes shows/movies, and more about character development.

5.0,"Michael C Hall, hot off the HBO series Six Feet Under, plays the title character Dexter Morgan in this series from Showrime Entertainment. A crime scene investigator from Miami who is an expert on blood. He also likes to seeking revenge on those criminals who escape the law by loopholes in the justice system. Believe me this is no CSI show!Created by novelist Jeff Lindsay, Hall and his supporting cast (including Lauren Velez, James Remar, Julie Benz, and Jennifer Carpenter)create an interesting portrait of man whose blood is dipped in both worlds. Hall's baby face showcases an evil side underneath his devilish killer smile. The show is an interesting character study as well as a great murder mystery.There is the  Ice Cream truck murderer who is stalking Dexter and leaving killer clues. The mystery unfolds in these 12 episodes and you will be intrigued by the last episode. This is like a good British televsion series, a full complete story unfolded in 12 parts.The extras on the fourth disk are  two episodes of Showtime's The Blotherhood (which is also available on DVD), audio commentary on the 12th episodes, and a true life crime story. Those of you with computer can read the first two chapters of the latest Dexter novel and a download of the Showtime show the Tutors (soon to be on DVD)Even without the extras, this is a five star killer show...its a bloody good time.

Not to mention the internet.  Not to mention religious or lack-thereof tolerance.  While watching this series I frequently cringed at the religious fanaticism of the Brits and the unbelievably deeply entrenched superstition of the Vikings.  Witch hunts anyone?  Anyone?  No?

5.0,"For those critics who always seemed to be surprised when Paul Walker gave good performances in his movies and seemed to chalk it up to the everything but PW's acting skills-this is the movie that proves he had acting chops.  He may not have aggressively chosen movies that highlighted his talents OR made a movie every year that kept that talent at the forefront but never doubt that he was a really good actor.  ""Effortlessly golden"" as James VanderBeek put it.  Yes...his acting was effortless which is why he didnt get the respect for it that he should have received (see Running Scared, Noel).  It is with such sadness that you will watch PW in one of his last movies hold the screen by himself for almost the entire length of the movie and give a most excellent performance.  You look into his eyes in this movie and you see a father dealing with the loss of his wife while simultaneously trying to keep his newborn baby alive and dealing with all of it during a massive disaster named Katrina.  The scene in which he is looking for his wife in the morgue is heartbreaking as he quietly demands that she be given dignity in her death.  The scenes in which he is talking to his baby about her family and quietly putting pictures on top of her incubator as he does it is so powerful.  I will miss all that this movie would have allowed him to achieve.  RIP Mr. Walker.  You were a most excellent talent.",1387411200,2013-12-19
5.0,"It was 1991 and a thriller became the most talked about movie of the year, so much so that it ended up winning the best film category at the Oscars. The movie was one of the most terrifying films made and offered a character (who was actually a secondary character to the main criminal being sought) that became a name associated with fear and horror as much as Freddy Krueger. The movie was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and the character was Hannibal Lecter. Now 22 years later we get to watch the exploits of Lecter once more only this time taking place before the film as well as the movies MANHUNTER and RED DRAGON  (both based on the same novel).HANNIBAL was a new series appearing last year on NBC and it arrives on DVD this week. This will be a fantastic thing for fans of the character because they may have missed the series when it began and for fans of the show because it will offer some of those items not aired on TV (one episode wasn't shown because it involved a child's death and would have run shortly after the Sandy Hook incident).While the series carries the name of the notorious serial killer the story doesn't revolve completely around him but around Lecter and FBI agent Will Graham (Hugh Dancy). Graham is a profiler for the FBI is the best there is but who also has a problem. When he gets into the mind of the killers they seek out, he delves so deeply into it that he often has problems coming back to the real world. This isn't to say he kills anyone, but the emotional toil this takes on him makes the work difficult at best and damaging at worst.When a new serial killer begins his spree Special Agent Jack Crawford (Lawrence Fishburne) appeals to Will to come out of retirement and assist him in capturing this new evil. Will has taken a position with the FBI teaching recruits the finer aspects of profiling and what to look for. While he doesn't want to help Jack for fear of losing himself in the search, he finally caves in and does so.This new killer is the essence of evil. He stalks his prey, young women, and then after capturing and killing them appears to eat a portion of them. A cannibalistic killer is something rare and new to this group of FBI agents. Will does exactly as expected, helping them follow up on clues from episode to episode. His colleague at the academy Dr. Alan Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas) warned Jack before hand that Will would need constant supervision. Wanting to catch the killer Jack allowed things to get out of hand. He finds help as the investigation progresses when he comes across a psychiatrist of note that could help Will. His name is Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen).As the series progresses Will begins seeing Lecter in his office for counseling but eventually Lecter helps the FBI in their search for the killer. What the FBI doesn't know is that Lecter has his own reasons for wanting the man caught. He's competition. And while those of us familiar with Lecter from the films know that he has a taste for his victims subtle hints of this are offered here in the series as well.The show is not for the faint of heart as it offers some of the most gruesome images ever to appear on national television. At the same time it offers one of the most complex mysteries ever offered on TV. The characters are completely formed rather than cardboard cutouts. Before you reach the halfway point you care about some, fear some and hope that others will simply survive before the show ends.The acting is some of the best ever seen on TV and why it was ignored by the Emmy board is beyond me. Standouts include both Dancy and Mikkelsen. Dancy's slow decent into madness makes you want to scream at the television that he shouldn't trust everyone he knows. Mikkelsen's elegant Lecter is someone that you would love to know and have dinner with if it weren't for his desire to serve you as the main course rather than offer you a meal.The show was successful enough to garner a second season to begin soon. Before that happens you now have the chance to get caught up with season one on DVD. It's a show that I would not only recommend you watch but that you add to your collection as well. That is unless you're afraid of watching something this intense.",1388448000,2013-12-31

2.0,"[BEWARE: The following review of ""The Asylum Blackout"" contains minor spoilers.]The title tells everything about the story. Well, apparently. In ""Asylum Blackout"" (aka ""The Incident"") George, an aspiring rock musician (Rupert Evans), is seen working as a cook at the Sans Asylum. One night, while working at the asylum's kitchen with his friends and band members Max (Kenny Doughty) and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy), there is a power failure due to a storm, and they are trapped inside the facilities with the inmates, who start attacking the guards.Director Alexandre Court&egrave;s (his feature debut) takes time in setting up the character of George - serious-minded and short of sleep - and does it very well. George is very tired and clearly needs a rest, while the story unfolds from his viewpoint. George says the riot is instigated by a certain inmate, but is it true?""Asylum Blackout"" has a few violent and gory torture scenes, but as the film's bizarre conclusion suggests, it obviously attempts to be something more than a survival horror, something more psychological. While the dimly-lit photography and stylish camerawork are effectively employed to represent the disturbing situations that surround George, there is also something wrong with the film's premise.For, in order to make the film an engrossing psychological thriller, you need, besides atmospheric photography, better narrative skills in telling the story. While watching the chaos that is going on inside the asylum, we ask ourselves: how come these security guards are inadequately armed when they are supposed to deal with violent and dangerous inmates? Why do the police take such a long time to respond?The film has potential for a more unnerving horror, but to create one you need a set-up that is more credible and intriguing.",1349913600,2012-10-11

4.0,We really like this show. it's funny with well developed quirky characters and the storylines stay fresh and unique from other shows.

4.0,I have followed the concepts in this film for a while now on my own and have come to pretty much the same conclusions. I don't know if they had the harder science and were dumbing it down or are just fanatics. The presentation was hollow and pretentious. Their heart seemed to be in the right place but they relied too much on standard production tricks rather than presenting a solid straight forward case. The science and documentation is out there they just need to work harder to find and use it.That is not to say I didn't enjoy the documentary and would recommend it to anyone curious on the topic. Once I started to give up modern food my whole life began to change for the better. My feeling is that this would be true for anyone.,1358467200,2013-01-18

3.0,"Mutant Chronicles finally makes its way to DVD, and despite some negative press surrounding it, the film as a whole isn't so bad at all.  Taking place in the distant future where Earth is run by four warring corporations, a race of mutants is awakened and begins laying waste to everything and everyone in sight.  Spiritual elder Brother Samuel (Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman) thinks he knows how to lead humanity to salvation, so he gathers a crew of soldiers for a suicide mission.  Most notably among them are Thomas Jane (The Mist, Hung) as rugged soldier Mitch Hunter, and Sin City's Devon Aoki; and they all make their descent to save the world.  While Mutant Chronicles is capably directed and features CGI effects that range from halfway decent to Sci-Fi Channel (or is it ScyFy Channel now?) quality, the film's biggest flaw lies in its pacing.  The first half of the film is sadly boring, but it does manage to pick itself up for the second half, and doesn't let go as the film races towards its conclusion.  Jane and Perlman are good, and despite the dim lighting, there are some fairly decent action scenes to be found here.  All in all, Mutant Chronicles isn't anything special in the least, but it is definitely worth a look for sci-fi/action fans at the very least.",1249430400,2009-08-05
5.0,"Does it really matter that everything takes place in the prewar-war torn UK? I think not, this is procedural crime solving at its best. The characters feel real and as the series progresses, one becomes involved with them and what transpires in their lives. I was hesitant at first, I grew up listening to my father's &#34;war stories&#34; and saw almost every WWII TV show/documentary/movie ever made during the 50s and 60s. I really didn't want to see more of the same. This is very different, its about people, well one man, Christopher Foyle, and what happens in his life while he masterfully solves crimes. You can watch his process while he solves the current mystery (the UK, especially in the small villages, is rife with murder it seems) all the while trying to do his bit in the war effort. If you like well-acted British crime drama, try it.",1375228800,2013-07-31

3.0,"I'm not really liking the season much this year... #11 is not only the team-thing full-time, but worse than that the designs are uninspiring. The team-thing is my least favorite of the challenges, as it is full of conflict... so an entire season of this is painful.And if that wasn't enough, this season's shows are popping up real late here at Amazon Instant (well after its competitors already have the new episodes up and on sale), so I've cancelled the season pass.",1363910400,2013-03-22
5.0,"We are living in something of a golden age of TV. Besides this series, there's The Blacklist, Believe, House of Cards, Homeland, and a few others. Frankly, I've just watch the pilot episode and WOW! This is a Keri Russell I can guarantee you've never seen before. In the couple she's part of, sleeper spies for the Soviet Union in the Reagan era, she's the super-hardnosed partner. In the first few minutes, you see her in a garterbelt set, compromising a Federal official while providing oral sex. Between sex and brutal violence, this show is definitely not for the kiddiies.While I have only seen the pilot, my sister assures me that the quality holds up quite well.",1398816000,2014-04-30
5.0,"I love Caroline Quentin. I followed the Jonathan Creek series avidly and she was one of the reasons I watched it. Her comedic skills are delightful!  She never overplays her roles. She shines in this series as an overworked cop and mother with a relaxed style which is a joy to watch. Too often such series focus on the violence and the protagonists are forced to reflect that violence. When one watches Blue Murder, one gets the feeling that &#34;Mummy &#34; will make everything better :-)",1376956800,2013-08-20

4.0,"Spoilers coming....This new version of Trek, with young actors playing the younger versions of the TOS crew, is exciting from beginning to end, with lots of action, adventure, humor, and creativity.  You have to keep up with the time travel twists, courtesy of LOST co-creator JJ Abrams.  And a certain very important planet filled with pointy-eared folk disappears. This makes certain events of the later series impossible.  You might also find it odd that Spock and Uhura have a thing for each other and don't hide it, that Sulu carries a sword into battle, that some Romulans have tattoos, and that Sarek looks awfully old and is awfully nice to young Spock--much nicer than he was in TOS.  Chris Pine has blue eyes, which Kirk never did.  And Uhura is little more than eye candy.If you can handle all of that, though, you will like the movie.  The fellow playing Chekov is adorable, while Karl Urban really takes the cake as McCoy.  Zachary Quinto is a marvel as Spock.  It would be nice to see more prequels, actually.  And we still don't know all the events that transpired while these folks were going through the academy.A great summer popcorn movie for sure.",1242864000,2009-05-21
5.0,"This show is capturing the imaginations of fans everywhere and for good reason, it is exceptionally well done.  The casting and exciting storylines are unique in their complexity and the actors are great.  It seems they have a hit on their hands if they can keep the politics and political correctness out of it.I am now several episodes into the show and surprisingly it seems to be getting even better.  I think they have a hit on their hands.",1378684800,2013-09-09
5.0,"Money is the root of all evil. Nicholas Jarecki wrote and directed this unrelentingly dark film about the etiology of our current financial lethal disease state and in doing so helps bring to light some of the aspects we need to examine instead of simply shudder and ignore. To have the courage to write such a controversial story (the nidus of which is exceedingly similar to the Bernie Madoff travesty) sets the tone for this film - a film that dares to explore the manner in which a wealthy businessman descends into his own hell and yet manages to survive. It is a disturbing theme: it is a brilliantly acted and directed film.Robert Miller (Richard Gere) is a multibillionaire hedge fund magnate whose errors in investing judgment are catching up with him. He is the patriarch of a family that consists of his supportive and adoring wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon, as beautiful and brilliant as ever), a son who is so unimportant that we never get to know him, and a beautiful bright daughter Brooke (Brit Marling, an actress to watch closely) who is Miller's sidekick in his trading empire. Miller's flaws show from the beginning: he has an artist mistress Julie (Laetitia Casta) with whom he secretly cavorts, an investment in Russian copper on which he spends his clients' money to acquire before the investment falls through, he owes money to an angry loaner who pressures him to pay off his huge debt, etc.  Troubles are compounded when Miller suggests to Julie they take her car and go to a seaside summer home to get away and during that trip Miller accidentally wrecks the car and Julie is killed.  Miller calls Jimmy (Nate Parker, another brilliant characterization), the son of a man Miller befriended in the past, to pick him up. And there the trouble begins.  A persistent but crooked detective (Tim Roth, superb!) causes problems as he investigates the death of Julie and from there Miler must try to put together the broken pieces of his life by selling his company (whose worth is questionable) to escape both his imprisonment for fraud and Jimmy's imprisonment for obstruction of justice.  How all this weaves together with his wife and his daughter is left in a manner that makes the audience wonder what will happen next - should the story proceed.Richard Gere gives probably the finest performance of his career: he has too frequently been overlooked for his memorable roles in movies. Likewise Susan Sarandon, Brit Marling, Nate Parker, and Tim Roth create characters we will never forget.  The supporting cast is populated with the likes of Graydon Carter (yes, of Vanity Fair fame), Stuart Margolin, Felix Solis, Reg E. Cathey, Curtiss Cook, Bruce Altman and many more. The music that highlights moments in the film is from such disparate singers as Billie Holliday and Bjork whose  `I See Who You Are' serves as an apropos closure during the film's final credits. It may be tough to witness the way the corporate world works, but few films have done a better job at pulling back the curtains to let us view those things we'd rather not acknowledge.

3.0,"I had somewhat high hopes for this series but got my first warning sign moments into the pilot, when we are told that &#34;the only punishment for crime is the death penalty&#34; if you're over 18. Really? That's the best the writers could do? It gets worse. Of course the landing craft loses communication, but we can accept that as a necessary plot twist. Ok. But do all the teenagers have to act like they don't have any sense at all? Not all young adult fiction is like that (except for the CW channel it seems). Some, such as The Hunger Games, show young people making adult decisions in trying circumstances. Do we have to watch every pairing between perfectly tanned delinquents start off with the long, soulful &#34;kiss-me&#34; looks from the first episode? Do all the adults either have to be evil/ruthless or a crusader?Ok, ok....let's skip to the part where the girl strips to take a swim (again, great muscle tone and tanned skin for someone locked up for years), jumps in the water and gets nabbed by a giant snake....a giant snake which decides to release her as soon as the attractive teens on the shore toss a rock at it. Then the rescued young woman has nothing more than scratches on her leg, when she was being held underwater in it's jaws? By this time I was sighing aloud.Oh, the bad guys....the juvies who just want to raise hell, make out and....ok, so maybe that part is realistic. But still....how long into the apocalypse before stomach's start to growl? How long until someone thinks maybe gathering food and water might be a good plan? I know Survivor will still be playing 200 years from now, but clearly these kids haven't seen it. Survival? Wait, you mean we can't order pizza delivery???I made myself watch the second episode, which was not quite as dumb, but this is apparently going to be a show where every predictable plot twist and every hint of simmering young adult sexuality will be utilized as often as possible. I love science fiction and I especially love apocalypse fiction....but I love well-written drama, fleshed out characters and actual human unpredictability more.I hope it gets better. Really, I do. Not every show can be a Breaking Bad or Walking Dead, but hey....you writers are getting paid to write. It's a dream job. Put some work into it, willya???",1398297600,2014-04-24

4.0,"Honestly, the acting really is superior.  This movie has been called &#34;low budget&#34; and by Hollywood standards it is - but there is NOTHING low budget about the performances and overall cinematography.  The cast and crew are destined for great things.Premise:  Swamp Monster Fact or FictionA &#34;bumbling&#34; documentary crew sets off to prove of disprove the existence and for a few of them this is an attempt to salvage their failed careers from a previous documentary they tried to fake.This premise weaves itself in and out of this movie with some good humor, some obvious plot twists, and an actual heart warming touch of humanity.That is all I am going to give a way, watch it for some light hearted humor but watch the actors - no stumbling on half rehearsed lines, they are seasoned performers.  Camera angels and placement are better than average, dialog is well thought out and presented.  Do not watch for any special effects (these are indeed reminiscent of early Godzilla and King Kong stop action photographic techniques and models, but not 'cheaply' done).If your a student of the arts or an aspiring actor/actress, or cinematographer you will take away some valuable lessons, this will never be a cult classic, but should be included in serious study of how to make a movie, and just having a good time.",1395532800,2014-03-23

They bring a more interesting view on their finding and explain more about what they see and find before and/or after they see a locker. While this show does the same thing, they don't do it as well.These Texas people do bring some different elements to the show. They more likely to bid low and keep low on their bids on lockers. They don't go buck wild like the City Folk as they call them in Texas. They all have similar but different personality to the original show cast members.Moe similar to Barry.Dave similar to VictorBubba and Ricky similar to Darrell and Brandon.Ricky and Lesa are similar to Jarrod and BrandiThis show is recommend if you really like the original Storage Wars show.",1339027200,2012-06-07

3.0,"Still enjoyable, still something I don't mind watching, but not something I'm dieing to see every week.  Still, it's interesting to see what people come up with in a crunch.Unfortunately, I think they've bled the amateur special effects artist pool dry because most of the people that they take are already professional artists.  Then again, it's a fine line and a wide spectrum with regard to being a professional.  I haven't resonated enough with the challenges.  I felt that the trip to Japan was wasted because they started off getting a few hours to make Oni (Japanese demon characters), then for the real challenge, they have to make anime characters, which really don't translate well into makeup.  Had they reversed it, I think they'd have had a much better show.I'm still a fan of creative series like this one, but in an attempt to go more extreme, more dramatic, I think they've lost the plot.  The art is the interesting part here, not the drama.",1394323200,2014-03-09

He breaks free and runs into a group of other soldiers where he is rescued by a model that can't speak who is leading them. They take him back to the base and he joins their army for the time being. The model leads the troops into an unfortunate situation and they loose 99% of their army. The survivors flee for their lives and the real movie starts as a plot turn erupts and they are now being hunted by the model. Along their journey the soldier runs into another model in the middle of the woods that saves them, then some other stuff happens and the soldier finally gets his show down with the model that can't speak.Overall the story is well... not the best... the movie is entertaining... you can watch it or miss it.

5.0,"I loved it! At first I thought that the premise was a little unrealistic. I mean, really, four senators sharing a house? How probable is that. I thought that it would be much more realistic if they had used Representatives. That I could see.Turns out that the show actually has some strong basis in reality. If you Google search for ""senators roommates"", then the first result is a New York Times article ( [...] ) about two high ranking senators and two representatives sharing a house together: Senators Charles E. Schumer and Richard J. Durbin, and Representatives George Miller (the house owner) and Bill Delahunt (who must have left since then as he did not seek re-election). The four are Democrats, but I'm guessing that the show writers and producers chose to use Republicans to avoid any appearance of using their stories, which could have caused legal problems. Well, that, and Republicans are so much easier to mock, since it's in vogue, and Republican politicians have to present themselves as extremists in order to stay in office. (BTW, I'm a Libertarian, so I can claim to be less biased then the vast majority of reviewers. This totally mocks Republicans, but the jokes are well deserved; I would say the same thing about well deserved jokes directed at Democrats; and even about Libertarians, if well deserved, since I'm really moderate for the party.) Another similarity is that the Miller house has two single rooms and a shared room, just like the Alpha House. I'm actually surprised that the show didn't have the usual B.S. disclaimer about any similarities to actual people is just a coincidence. Maybe the producers have admitted that they were inspired by the Miller house.I'm a little bummed that Bill Murray may have only been making a cameo, but I'm guessing that if his legal troubles entangle a roommate or two that we could keep seeing him pop up, which would be awesome. Although, I wouldn't be sad if they didn't bring him back because he was over-acting quite a bit, but that's why we love him, right?Based on the cast and how professionally this was filmed I'm guessing that the show is already slated for a full season (maybe even already in production?), but that Amazon is just casting it as a ""test"" pilot in order to direct attention to their other actual test pilots. Regardless, I would LOVE to see more of this show!!!",1367107200,2013-04-28

This one is so, so lame.Their fantasy of Trip-the George Bush-ish NASCAR like mechanic-that beds an exotic beautiful woman and has an immaculate conception. Whose twisted fantasy is this. Lol. And then of course it is back to the evil man and his evil machine to kill all other races, echoing the Nazis in the first episode of this year's shows. This is new? This show is so full of mish-mash tripe that I am so glad there are no more. This last season was certainly painful to watch. I did enjoy most of season three however, and the overriding story arch with the unusual harshness of the decisions Captain Archer has to make, making it a truly deep emotional engaging show. The first three seasons were good overall and this one is a plane going down in a ball of flames. This next to last episode is the crash with the fireball.",1325721600,2012-01-05

5.0,"Well put together, I don't believe not one curse word was in it.  Good actors, did their job well.  Although a good movie, I would not allow teenagers and children to view this movie.

5.0,Loved the premise that a widow inherits a NFL team and doesn't know how to run it like the &#34;good old boys&#34; want her to. Characters are interesting and fun.

4.0,"I came to this show with no preconceptions of it outside the cover image, or one like it, which I found interesting. It suggested some manner of contagion related in form to the corticeps fungus, which is the stuff my nightmares are made of, and was stylishly, cleverly designed. The pilot didn't disappoint. It presented a high-tech, incredibly vast laboratory complex, isolated in a desolate, inhospitable region of the arctic. Any show that involves a group of people cut off from the comforts and protections that civilization affords has my attention. Whether it's a 'Desert Island'/'Space Station'-type scenario (i.e. Helix, Lost, Cube, Pitch Black, Sunshine, Triangle, The Human Race, The Cabin in the Woods, Alien, Last Days On Mars) or an 'Apocalypse'/'Natural-Unnatural Disaster'-scenario (i.e. The Road, The Walking Dead, The Mist, Dawn/Day of the Dead, The 100, 28 Days Later, The Road Warrior, The Last Ship, Survivors, Cloverfield), the idea of more-or-less regular people being thrown into extreme situations they can't fully understand is one I'll never tire of. Why should I? How many iterations of the police procedural have made their way to television since Dragnet debuted in the early fifties? 100? 1000? And that's a far more limited genre than the 'survival drama', which can include zombies, contagions, vampires, nuclear wastelands, extradimensional monstrosities, etc., etc.Helix begins with a team of CDC investigators being called to the scene of an unspecified outbreak at the aforementioned top-secret research facility, Led by Dr. Alan Faragut, the team finds itself mostly unwanted by the facility staff. They discover that a virus has breached containment, a very mysterious and unpredictable virus with seemingly impossible characteristics. Those infected, deemed 'Vectors' in CDC parlance, might die horribly, or be transformed into zombies, dripping black-blood ooze from every orifice. A small minority, meanwhile, apparently overcome the virus, stronger than before, but changed. One of the scientists working at this facility is Faragut's brother, Peter, who is an infected zombie 'Vector' when the series begins. Faragut's ex-wife, who had an affair with Peter, is one of the members of the CDC investigative team, as is a young female protege and lover of the good Doctor. This tangle of raw nerves and fractured relationships somehow manages to play out beneath the sheer insanity that begins to erupt when the team attempts to quarantine the facility.Dr. Hiroshi Hatake, portrayed by the always excellent Hiroyuki Sanada, is in charge of the project, and it is clear from the outset that he is more concerned with keeping his secrets than saving lives. Attempts are made to thwart the investigation, and when team members begin being murdered, Faragut realizes that he has stumbled onto a conspiracy with a wider scope and more moving parts than he's able to comprehend. He's too late however, as communications to the outside world are cut off, and control of the vectors is lost. At least one assassin is moving freely amongst them, and the powerful cabal that has been funding the project have apparently sent some very nasty people (one of them Jeri Ryan, having fun playing a villain for once... although, she was Borg...). Faragut desperately tries to protect what's left of his team and the surviving researchers, find a way to re-establish contact with his superiors, unravel the mysteries of the virus, and figure out who he can trust before professional assassins show up to murder everyone, take the virus, and leave behind a smoking crater full of charred bones. He's a busy guy.Deciding on whether or not to trust Hatake is pivotal; although he may have engineered the crisis for reasons I won't reveal, he is also the only man who can explain what's happening and why... although it becomes clear early on that it might involve engineering a virus that holds the secret to immortality.The writing on Season 1 started out very strong, with the first three episodes leaving me with the impression that Helix could be one of the best SF shows on television. The next few installments curbed my enthusiasm, so to speak. The Show-runners started to lose the narrative thread as Dr. Faragut lost control of the quarantine, allowing characters to flounder as everyone, including the viewer, became confused about what the agenda was. Without revealing crucial plot details, the digression involving Inuit twins was pointless, and seemed to have the sole purpose of turning a great, charismatic 'bad guy' into a 'good guy', perhaps because he was the most interesting character on the show, after Dr. Hatake.Still, the writers managed to pull things together enough by the end of the season that I wasn't throwing things, or screaming obscenities at the TV. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with season 2. Whatever they decide, It can't be any worse than the second season of Under the Dome. 3.5/5 (70/100)",1405900800,2014-07-21

3.0,"They lost me at the start, that overused gimmick of beginning a movie in mid stride only to abruptly put a halt to the unexplained action by pulling back to another point in time.  In effect saying, never mind, pay no attention to that guy running in the snow, it's not about that...yet.  I immediately start to worry when the beginning has to be started twice.How historical this was I do not know and frankly it didn't pique my interest enough to find out.I will say that it was action packed, very bleak and very violent, with a whole lot of running/chasing/running, more running, even more running...fighting, running, more fighting.  I found it amusing that the Romans were a bit put off because the Picts fought ""without honor.""  Meaning that they didn't fool around but got down to the business at hand: kill or be killed.  They were obviously better at it because they didn't weigh themselves down with heavy noisy armor.  Nor did they march in formation and group themselves into easy targets.  Basically, this was a combat picture and a lesson in enemies (sometimes the person sitting next to you might prove more hazardous to your health than the people you are fighting).  This movie was even structured a bit like a horror film: high body count, horrible ways of dying, few left while the closing credits roll.  And!  Unmemorable characters, I forgot who was dead who wasn't, I started counting heads, found that difficult because so many people were losing theirs.  In the end, I was left wondering what the point was; who were you supposed to root for?It helps to know that this movie did not fare well in the UK, which explains why it went straight to DVD after that.I am glad I watched it, not a bad time killer, but it didn't make it into my collection.",1299542400,2011-03-08

5.0,"The end of the third series had been dramatic with the killing of Mitchell by George. But nothing is simple in this fourth series. Nina has disappeared because after giving birth to a girl she does not have time to name she is destroyed by some vampiristic mob. George is paranoid about the prediction that the baby is the saviour of humanity and has to be killed by the vampires when they come to take over the world, he understands it as if she had to be killed for vampires to be able to take over. He is unable to survive very long in that paranoia and thus he leaves Annie and the baby with an unfinished job, in his mind at least. If he knew the truth he would really be frightened. But the house is a real crossroads for vampires, werewolves and ghosts, provided they are all detached from the real monstrous things they may represent and they are trying to live human lives.A young werewolf comes back, Tom , and he is known of us so he is easily accepted and integrated even before George disappears. But he is still a kid and he has to learn how to fight and kill vampires since werewolves have that divine task to do.The vampire is more difficult to find. He is Hal, but in fact this is a nickname and they learn in due time he is an old one who has decided to leave the flock and wean himself, which he has been doing for fifty five years now, a short time after all when compared to the extreme length of his living dead survival he calls a life.  And being this old one he is also the future king of the vampires when they take the world over. He is Prince Harry, a common name for a prince since Shakespeare and quite popular nowadays.But this series has a new tone in a way because it is the series in which the old ones are coming to take over the world and they have to be destroyed. But the problem is the prediction. The baby called Eve by George on his death bed is the saviour of humanity. But is she the one who can protect humanity by being alive against the vampires? Or is she the one who can stop and destroy all the old ones by dying? Or is she the one who can open the gates to vampires by dying? The same question is at the heart of these questions: must Eve live and protect humanity or die and save humanity as well as destroy the old ones?In fact this question is not even accurate. Little by little we know the baby Eve has to die but the real question is how? Especially when the ghost of an eighteen year old Eve comes up into the picture to explain to Annie why she, Eve, must die.Of course it is all more complicated than that and our three main heroes will be joined by the ghost of Alex, a girl Hal had courted a little bit and who was killed by a certain Cutler, a vampire obsessed by making history and who trapped Harry into drinking her blood, which send Harry back on a frenzy of submissiveness to the oldest one of them all, the one from whom all vampire DNA comes and who finally arrives on earth to fulfil the prophecy.To spice up the tale we have flash-forwards into the future as it is going to be if the vampires take over. Something pretty scary since human beings will have to be eliminated except the number necessary to feed the vampires. Humanity will become the bleeding cattle of the newcomers. This is very similar to the means used in other series or in novels to achieve the same objective: to make the heroes save the present because there is no future without a present that is alive and well. I am thinking of Terminator of course, the whole saga, including the TV series of the John Connor's mother's diaries. I am thinking of Supernatural in which angels and archangels send the heroes Dean and Sam into the future the way it would be if they did not accept to play the game of the Apocalypse. I am thinking of many science-fiction books by Stephen King and others, including Ron L. Hubbard, that use the vision of the future to make us understand that we have to save the present.But here the present can only be saved by Annie, Tom and Hal. And it is saved of course, and the baby is sacrificed to save humanity. And it is the fire of god that does the business. They forgot to tell us clearly that this fire came from god but we can subsume it all by ourselves, can't we? The old ones will be destroyed of course because there are two ways to destroy vampires, a stake in the heart or fire. Now you have to watch the eight episodes if you want to know how and where and when and by whom.Three survivors: Hal, Tom and Alex, a phenomenal m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with an immediate emergency: to wean Hal from his having drunk some blood. We also discover another type of humans, but are they humans, people or beings who are supposed to keep the secret hidden and to collect all the evidence they can and that could reveal that secret to the world: the world is under the menace from vampires and among us we have quite a few vampires and werewolves. Those we can see, though the vampires are invisible in mirrors and cameras and telephone webcams, etc. The third type of monsters, if they are monsters of course, are ghosts and those are invisible, sorry folks, there must always be a cheater somewhere in any games and ghosts are the cheaters, and we are the losers of course.Who will win in the next series? The vampires, the werewolves or the ghosts? I am ready to bet on werewolves because they are sexy animals, whereas ghosts are immaterial and vampires are killing machines and blood suckers. Though the series is discreet about the intimate life of the heroes, when speaking of suction, there is better and more pleasurable things to do than suck blood. At least George was a practising believer as for that.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",1344902400,2012-08-14

3.0,"I hope it wasn't: &#34;It's like SMASH, only with classical music i.e. Lincoln Center instead of Broadway.&#34;  But throughout I got the nagging feeling that WAS how this pilot was pitched.  Characterizations - shallow and stereotypical: old diabolical maestro, veteran virtuoso who sleeps around, young upstart maestro on the lookout for fresh meat, and the vulnerable young ingenue, etc. etc.  Plotlines - who gets stabbed in the back, who sleeps with whom, etc. etc.  I like the casting and female oboe players usually have me at hello, but I was plenty skeptical about this.Finally, why do these Amazon pilots have such tentative plotlines?  So little gets accomplished in an hour (compared to, say, BREAKING BAD or THE GOOD WIFE).  Is it because they're all meant to go nowhere fast?  Certainly feels like that with both this and BOSCH.",1393459200,2014-02-27
2.0,"Great story idea.  Great ensemble of actors.  Terrible script, editing, WAY of telling the story.  Puts one to sleep, no identification with the characters, no backstory to justify hanging in to watch during the long mimic-BBC pauses with the meaningful looks.  Yawn.A Gary Oldman or Alec Guinness or Ian X (really, any of the 'Ian' actors we all know and love), can hold the viewer's interest, during long Brit-like pregnant pauses and silences, which alike baffle the average audience.  Yet actors you rarely see on TV or film, need something more;  they need LINES, or at least meaningful blocking.  Since these long pauses and silences don't seem to add to the plot at all, and since there is no backstory to establish empathy with the characters, one is left waiting waiting waiting for something to be said or done to justify watching further.Some of the reviewers are all happy about the sophistication in the storyline.  Yeah, but if you're watching paint dry for most of each episode, the sophistication doesn't 'pay off'.  We don't need car chases and shoot-em-ups, we need MORE LINES.  Shakespeare knew that.  So why didn't the script writer, here?  Who messed up this good story?So I forced myself to get through the series.  So I don't wonder why AMC pulled the plug.  It's bad scripting and bad film editing; not the acting, and not the plot.  WAY TOO SLOW, people.  WAY TOO LACKING in lines, subplots unexplored, so of course the viewer will be bored.  Were I a potential commercial sponsor, I wouldn't want my commercials playing during this show, due to its snoozy presentation.  Not fair to the actors or the plot, either.  A story which needs to be explored (whether plausible or not) -- just got wasted.  Pity.FIX IT, please, and redo so the audience can follow along, cut all those long meaningless pauses with headshots, substitute meaningful dialog instead, so the audience can connect the dots.  People like whodunits, that's the most popular story format since the Garden of Eden.Then, you'll get a good audience.",1371168000,2013-06-14

5.0,"The close of WWII (~1945) marked the time the J N*w W*rld Ord*r took complete control of the U.S. government. After the cover-up and murder by US government agents of all witnesses of the Kennedy assassination, US citizens began to realize they could not trust this totally corrupt entity. They think like lawyers (and most of them are)...if there are no witnesses, then IT didn't happen! We now live in a JNWO police state, with the dept of HS and the p*triot act having taken away the last vestiges of Constitutional rights for the average American citizen! This in-depth documentary of TWA flight 800, which deals specifically only with REAL EVIDENCE and REAL EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY, shows us who these aliens really are who control our totally corrupt government! Corrupt testimony of outright lies by the NTSB, the F*I and C*A (all corrupt governmental agencies of the JNWO federal government) displays one of the most blatant and disgusting cover-ups in the history of the United States! Normally they would just murder all witnesses, as they did in the Kennedy assassination. However with 200 plus witnesses this was not feasible, although the F*I did directly threaten each witness and tell them to remain silent! They just refused to let any of them testify! Incredibly the film does not discuss WHY this attack happened, as it would just be conjecture. It is fact that THREE missiles were fired at Flight 800. If only ONE had been fired, one could possibly take this as a military accidental foul-up! This happened in the Middle East when a civilian airliner was mistaken for a military target. But THREE missiles were fired at and tracked F800 and all three exploded, bringing the plane down in a fireball. So in other words it was not accidental, but intentional (first-degree murder). The film does not go beyond this point. Two missiles CAME OUT OF THE OCEAN (i.e. submarine-fired missiles) and one originated ON THE SURFACE (ship), so this was under a US military command structure and therefore had to come from the very highest level of American government. WHY? The JNWO-controlled US government routinely assassinates hundreds of people every day it considers subversive to its total control. Why would they have to blow a plane out of the air? The only answer is that the suspected victim who was on the flight had information which was detrimental to corrupt governmental/military function and was not stopped before he/she boarded. One of the Airport movies concerning the Concord covers this very scenario! Three missiles? Whatever this person was carrying was of catastrophically paramount importance, because they made damn sure the plane came down! When the military/government murder citizens by accident or because they are in a blast zone, they are referred to as ""collateral damage"". And they have no remorse. For five years they covered this up, lied and gave false testimony to the public; and the JNWO-controlled American media was right there spewing out the lies and disinformation/propaganda. The present totally-corrupt US government REALIZES that NO ONE believes anything they say or do anymore...and of course they do not care. They have no credibility left and never will they recover it!",1391558400,2014-02-05

5.0,"instead of thinking that Japanese message they intercepted was a trap to lure more naval personnel into the area, they should have tried to make contact with the USS Indianapolis and then if contact failed they should have immediately launched a search and rescue mission.secondly the ship was overdue, and still no contact was made by the navy with the USS Indianapolis, nor any search and rescue enacted.this was a case of many innocent sailors dying because the Navy did not care enough to follow through.too many navy personnel died while other navy personnel ignored their cries for help.what was never discussed was who from the navy who ignored the above,  and were they ever prosecuted and found guilty?too many unanswered questions which deserve answers now, and i hope we finally learn all the answers to the above concerns.too many navy personnel died while other navy personnel ignored their cries for help.lastly the naval officer they said was guilty of negligence, while all survivors said he did everything to keep them all alive and went above and beyond, but nevertheless the navy made him feel so guilty he ended up killing himself.......now that i call grave naval injustice, and a loss of the life of an exemplary naval officer, who went through hell on earth in the sea but still managed to keep many crewman alive to be rescued.",1370649600,2013-06-08

5.0,"If you purchase this DVD, make sure you watch the extras on disc 4. Forest Whitaker discusses how the Kavanaugh character was conceived as someone who ""becomes"" Mackey as he pursues him, and you will certainly see a transformation over the course of Season 5's eleven episodes. It would be very easy to over-hype Whitaker's contribution if it weren't so spot-on perfect. On DVD 4, series creator Shawn Ryan states that he wanted Whitaker for this character and there ""was no second choice."" If you remember the famous 1998 episode of NYPD Blue called ""Raging Bulls,"" in which Dennis Franz's Sipowicz and James McDaniel's Lt. Fancy come to explosive blows after a long, slow simmer, imagine what happens immediately after Kavanaugh asks Mackey in a rage-filled voice ""Are you happy NOW...Detective Mackey?"" There was a strong undercurrent of racial tensions between the NYPD Blue characters, which led (in a large part) to them both reaching the breaking point, but Mackey and Kavanaugh are not at odds with each other because of their ethnicity. Over the course of the entire season, the subject is never approached and it is not a relevant detail in the conflict. They're two men who began with the right motives and slowly let their circumstances determine their mission. There are mixed opinions surrounding the Glenn Close ""Capt. Rawling"" story arc experiment from Season 4. In a few short days, Whitaker is back for a second season as Kavanaugh, and the events of Season 5 were grounded more in risk taking than stunt scripting. The Shield is a brutal, intensely creative show with one of the best casts and creative teams on TV. By creating synergy with the events laid out in the pilot episode (and multiple references in the ""extras"" portion of the set to ""Shakespearean"" drama), it's clear that this series aims very, very high and more often than not hits the target.",1175385600,2007-04-01

5.0,"I tried to walk away.  Quit. Just say goodbye.  But it's impossible. How can you turn your back on Caroline, the evil genius who poses as a caring friend and mother but, in fact, is the source of all the real drama. The woman is sublime in her badness.  And then there's Teresa Guidice, with the amazing hair and crooked husband. Her Joe is literally as wide as he is tall, tough little bugger, except he's either narcoleptic or drunk all the time. Hard to tell.Teresa is the current Villain of the piece (I don't think the world at large is onto Caroline yet, but I hope they figure it out and soon).  She is hilarious. A woman of oversized assets, Teresa crams herself into clothing that is pink, leopard-spotted, shiny, feathered or leather-ish.  No color is too bright, no style too outr&eacute;.  For this woman, sequins are the new black.  But she's not evil. Just jealous.  She is not, let's say, the smartest anchovy in the bagna cauda.  A published author, Mrs. Guidice 'writes' cookbooks. Ok, actually she just poses for pictures among the recipes collected by some worker bees, but still, standing and facing the camera is, you know, work. it must take hours to get that make up on. And somebody has to round up the kids.  And oh boy, what kids.The oldest, 11 going on 45, is a world-weary cynic, a model and dancer, who seems to know way, way too much about the ins and outs of marital relations and family dysfunction, not to mention teased hair, hair extensions and weekly pedicures. All three little girls who range down to about five, are fighters and biters. They whine, they complain, they pose hands on hips and toss their manes. Just like mama. One can only hope they surprise us all and don't grow up into what we're all expecting.Anyway, Teresa isn't bad, she just envies any woman younger, prettier or slimmer. Okay, in her crowd there are not many, these women obviously like to eat and their spandex capris aren't helping things out.  Neither is the make up.  Lashes out to there, orange lipstick on gigantically inflated lips. I mean, the lips are so big, I'll bet they need ladles to eat soup.  And the eye make up? I'm not kidding. If you want faux mink lashes, black liner and Super-Extending Mascara, I'll bet you have to drive down to Delaware to get it.  So we know how Teresa must feel. Even with all the Special Effects make up, there is something simian about her face. She's not a beauty and she's not so young. Or so skinny. When she encounters someone who is, watch out.Mostly Teresa is jealous of her sister in law, the sexy and slender (by comparison) Melissa Gorga...prettier and younger and wife to Teresa's brother. Who is more successful than Teresa's husband, not cheating on his wife, and not under indictment. Who wouldn't be jealous?  The brother is also as wide as he is tall, but he does have beautiful eyes and at least stays awake.  Mrs. Gorga thought she could sing at one point, and for almost one full year we watched various producers show up to get big bucks from her husband as they tried (almost successfully)to pretend she had talent. Anyway, Teresa hates her.There are other men and women besides the core group...we have extra sisters and brothers, parents and aunts and uncles, cousins, one idiot cousin in law and one gay one, and lots of frenemies, but aside from all having world-class heavyweight keisters, they don't count for much. They change sides, gossip, wear awful clothes and have their own rococo homes.  We don't care about them.  It's Caroline, Teresa and Melissa who are the magic.Caroline is older than the others, a lot older. And fatter.  And she always looks unkempt.  No wonder she stirs up trouble.  Her children are extremely strange. The boys have no visible means of support other than some questionable 'PR' business that trades on their mother's fame. They appear to be pushing 30, both of them, and their mom just bought them a ""really classy"" bachelor pad in Newark -- full of leatherette furniture and what looks to be at least three faux stone fountains. One of the sons...the visionary...treasures a dream of one day owning a combination strip-club/car wash.  The daughter (after many seasons' worth of trauma and skin of her teeth graduation from manicurist college)now has her own nail salon, also courtesy of a generous mama.Okay, are you hooked yet?  Trust me, watch this show. No matter how screwed up you are, how bad your family is, you can't sit through sixty minutes of this without thinking ""Whew.""  But for the grace of god and some decent taste in clothes, make up and men, there go all of us.I started out with Real Housewives of New York, but the women are at least 20 years past their sell-by dates.  No fun watching Grandma carousing in her Gucci hip boots. But the Jersey Gals...just try them.  I haven't even mentioned Jaqueline yet...or Caroline's sister from the first season who will not speak to her sister or discuss the show ever, with anyone...except TV bloggers and newspaper columnists and tabloids.  And Joe Guidice? Don't get me started.  He's going to jail, probably, and maybe Teresa will spend a night or two in dire incarceration as well.  Or Caroline's dad-in-law who was NOT, don't get her dander up on this) a member of organized crime in any way, shape or form, just because he was gunned down while entering his favorite restaurant (and it wasn't a sushi bar, know what I mean.

3.0,"The two remaining innkeepers at the Yankee Pedlar Inn get more than they bargained for when they set out to capture evidence of the hotel's legendary ghost in THE INNKEEPERS, Ti West's highly-anticipated followup to HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. Once again, the director moves to impress with his incredible talent for balancing a slow, deliberate pace with clever characters and spooky suspense, though the same can't be said for the plot, itself. Sara Paxton and Pat Healy couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the two awkward leads, bringing their own dry wit and innocent charm to the characters. For all West's skills as a writer and director, however, he is found lacking as an effective storyteller. He simply doesn't know where to go with his films, and as a result, they typically fall apart in the final act. THE INNKEEPERS is no exception. While we have fun sitting back and laughing with his two bumbling hotel clerks, the questions set up in the first several chapters are left entirely open-ended, and the mild shocks do not compensate for the lengthy build and anticipation. Still, it is impossible to deny the man's skill behind a camera. Even the most trivial scenes are made interesting through his keen visual style, which keeps the audience glued to the screen despite the overall lack of action. Fans of the slow burn will appreciate the many redeeming qualities in THE INNKEEPERS, and it is sure to receive a cult status amongst other subtle haunts like THE CHANGELING, THE SENTINEL, or BURNT OFFERINGS.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",1359590400,2013-01-31

2.0,"Along with the last episode, there is far, far too much weight given to the bad guy. Yeah we get it. He's a sociopath murderer who gets off on power and murdering. Yeah, we get it, he manipulates people to his own end, like sociopaths do. Yeah, we get it, he wants to kill all of Rick's crew because they got over on him. Yeah, we get it, he doesn't kill to protect, that's his self delusion that justifies his serial and mass murdering sprees.It's almost like the writers have a fascination with the sociopath mind. Perhaps it's a kind of hero worship for them. Actually, it's an indication they are relying on cheap emotional thrills rather than good, solid writing. You can tell when writers have nothing else to give: They keep repeating the same old thing in a little different way to get cheap emotional thrills from viewers, hoping they will return for, yes, more cheap emotional thrills.How many times will the bad guy come back? How many more innocent good people will he murder? How many more people will he torture? How many more women will he rape?

He goes missing for 3 months but his mother hires an ex-ISIS guy named Rip Riley (Patrick Warburton) an adventurer (and former lover of Archer's mom) who finds Archer on a tropical island working as a bartender and sleeping with newlywed women in order to destroy the marriage (I think... it's hard to tell why he does the things he does). When Archer refuses to leave and instead smashes a glass bottle into Rip's face, Rip takes Archer by force onto his plane in handcuffs; basically kidnapping him to return him to his mom.A lot happens but basically Rip and Archer wind up captured by pirates until Archer kills the leader of the pirates and becomes the new leader of the pirates, and Archer apparently embraces his new profession when he announces that he is now the Pirate King!I hope so much that Rip winds up being Archer's real father.

I prefer the current Will to both previous interpretations on screen. In a TV series, there is ample time to explain his peculiar gifts.

It kind of drags when James Spader isn't on screen and even when he is on screen, I find myself thinking that this seems to be about his paritcular style of line delivery where some of the stuff coming out of his mouth is  such nonsense like how so and so was diving the barrier reef off Belize - it sounds like Mad Libs where you just insert exotic notions here and there to create an impression like James Spader's dead eyes and drawl.  I enjoy James Spader even more now that he is weightier despite his character's penchant for hats here - it is SO close to being Truman Capote ridiculous - pulled back from tipping over the edge by James Spader's constantly pressed lips throughout the series.  Megan Boone is nice and has very cute baby feet so there is all this cuteness hidden under boring work clothes but really this show is a demonstration that James Spader can command attention in more than one way.That doesn't make the show watchable to me but the Stewmaker episode ... Red Dragon is very creepy here and the last ten minutes - I wish I could buy just that scene.The way the show is written so that James Spader is the most interesting is very similar to the kdramaThe Greatest Love - Korean Drama (4 DVD) All Region with English Subtitleswhere the show is kind of flat whenever Cha Seung Won is not onscreen and that has everything to do with the writing and not the rest of the cast as indicated by the subsequent kdrama with the same lead actress and a very similar underlying message, Master's Sun.The show gets much better with the last two episodesAnslo Garrick (No. 16), Part 1and then you really have to wonder if James Spader's character wants everyone on his hitlist taken out for him facilitated by his orchestrating their appearance as well as getting into the government's files AND inexplicably seduce Elizabeth Keen into being on his side which Elizabeth Keen probably smells if she was raised by that hardnosed cast as her foster father.However, the big thing is that the premise of his reentry into the CIA building MAKES NO SENSE and picking Elizabeth Keene - newly hatched makes less than NO SENSE - but she's being surveilled at home as a result - even in the BATHROOM - by a bunch of old dudes across the street so the whole show may be about making her bait.",1383436800,2013-11-03

4.0,"In high school biology, I remember photosynthesis being taught.  This, moreover, says that plants need three ingredients to grow well: nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium.  It explains why that is and then practically says man must explore land, air, and water to obtain it.Like a lot of ""Modern Marvels"" episodes, this shows the inner workings of factories.  There's a commercial of Honey Bunches of O's that works in the same.  Remember the ""Simpsons"" episode in which Bart and his classmates go to a box factory?  Well, a lot of episodes in this series are like that.  However, so much of this episode deals with fecal matter that it's funny seeing so many men put their hands in compost that I practically want to yell out, ""Do you know where that's been!?""The program doesn't start mentioning doodoo until about 15 minutes in.  However, the narrator stated that some South American countries fought a war to get access to bird droppings.  The narrator stated, ""Straight from the bat's behind and into the can.""  He also said, ""One more hard push and it's out!""  They seem somewhat conscious of the humor of the subject.For years, I've asked people online, ""Is there something that can be done with human doodoo?  I mean, we make so much of it.  Can it be helpful somehow?""  I love this episode as it partially answers that question.  However, the only use they assign to it is for golf courses.  What about keeping the Sahara from growing?  What about helping islands to stay around despite global warming?  There is an environmental documentary from PBS that said chicken doodoo is what's ruining all the water in the Chesapeake.  This program suggests that worms, cows, bats, and birds make useful doodoo, but the show ignores the doodoo that's bad for the world.So many environmental documentaries are about doom and gloom.  They make you want to close the curtains and hide, rather than fight to save the planet.  Well, this episode suggests that the stinky brown stuff may be the globe's ray of light in many ways.",1327190400,2012-01-22

This is a pretty good series if you like the spooky VoiceOver coupled with the regular person giving snippets of their version while better looking actors play them in a reenactment format.My only problem is that while this rolls along and can get very scary at times, some of the reenactment kind of makes me laugh...for instance demons in the mirror will simply be someone in really cheezy halloween makeup with a bushy wig...if you're going to all of the trouble to make it all seem real, why not go the extra step and make the demons and grim reaper characters not look so hokey?Aside from that these episodes can be pretty entertaining if not wholly believable.",1362182400,2013-03-02

It is however, very well done relating the story line without taking too much time in unnecessary (but there is some) sex scenes. Otherwise the graphic nature of the violence is the only other aspect to be aware of as it is not a normal t.v. show that holds back at some level.

The story makes zero sense at all, the characters are all extremely unlikable- especially the french woman who is supposed to be the main protagonist and to be perfectly honest- there is no chance any of these people would stick together within five minutes if this actually went down. The plot has ADD and skips all over, I watched this with some friends and we all went into this with an extremely open mind. There are many other good selections for amazon to pick up and I really hope this is not one of them. Don't be a sheep! actually *watch* the full pilot before you post a review please! we all love chris carter but this junk stinks.

5.0,"With ""Battlestar Galactica"" all wrapped-up, I was hurting for more hard core sci-fi! ""Caprica"" filled that gap until the season ended. Then to my surprise a new Stargate adopted the hardcore egde! I know that some people will hate this but I cant get enough. SGU starts out a bit slow and I think that's great.Early on the newly formed crew is desperately trying to find out where they are and what the hell happened! They learn that they're on a ship called Destiny very far away from earth. They must also find basic recources for survival but most of these people aren't trained SG military officers. Naturally lines are drawn and alliances are made. And like BSG and Caprica, no mercy is shown. There are military men and women with guns and more guns and there are civillians. They have no guns. Guess what happens when critcal life and death descisions need to be made and one side has guns and the other does not? Yeah - It gets ugly.As time goes on the crew finds a new star and planet that wasn't originally there back in the day. Some of the crew decide to stick around because they think who ever created the system will help them get back to earth! Really? Mabey these super-intelligent beings dont want filthy humans pissing on their brand new planet. Time will tell!...I love this kind of Ultra hardcore sci-fi. Im glad to see that the Stargate franchise went in this direction and I cant wait for season 2. Wether you like sci-fi or not this show is a great buy. It's the kind of show that's actually genre bending! Is it really sci-fi or is it drama? I had to ask myself that question about BSG. What do you think?UPDATE:The special features are top notch! It's all in HD and well put together. You get to see the actors behind the scenes as well as insight on the sets. There are also sit-down interviews with the actors, opposite the producer and creater, to discuss the psycology of their own character(s)! But for me seeing the actors outside of their charaters was eye opening. The most drastic difference was with Louis Ferreira. You quickly begin to understand just how good these people really are.UPDATE 2:It's been CANCELLED.",1283558400,2010-09-04
2.0,"This could have been a great show. But its not. What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small-town America. They get to be ""bad"" guys, but bad guys within real strict limits. Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs. To undermine the premise even further they create real ""bad guys"" in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the ""good"" Bikers can't do.The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos. We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money. Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something. He just comes across as a total wuss.Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang. But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire. The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works. Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they bitch at each other.Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey. When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble. But in Sons of Anarchy, Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk, it always pays off.One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters. There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.I really wanted to like this. And there were some things that I did really like. But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy.",1254268800,2009-09-30

Having I scientific bent and inquisitiveness, I always wondered how recipes were constructed and what accounted for the differences in techniques and how the ingredients reacted or interacted. Good Eats has done much to answer both of those questions. Some may find the illustrations a bit eccentric (sock puppets standing in for yeast cells, a frame with an elastic mesh for a gluten protein matrix, etc.) but all in allthat they demonstrate the point at hand well.

4.0,"This is a promising reboot of the Star Trek series, with the decided influence of JJ Abrams and friends. It's obviously hard to judge this one movie versus the existing Star Trek universe, but that's all we have for now.Skylar-Spock definitely stole the show as he was/is ideally suited to play a young Spock. Not quite as logical as Spock Prime - having an affair with a student is quite illogical after all. But as attempt #1 and playing a younger Spock one could not ask for a better performance.The rest of the characters need work in future movies before they establish themselves. New-Kirk was a bit too much 90210, New-Checkov was over-done with the geekery TNG-style, New-McCoy felt out of phase at times, and New-Sulu was not quite right. New-Uhura and New-Scottie are a step ahead of the rest of the main characters. Tyler Perry, talented and creative as he is, he was not very convincing as a high-ranking Star Fleet officer. It sort of stood out.The other issue with the movie is that the villain du jour was actually not particularly impressive considering the grand stage. Other than the scary-looking space-ship, this was a typical TNG villain. The best they could come up with was an angry miner with a mining ship destroying the galaxy?On the plus site, Abrams and Crew paid a lot of attention to a number of details from the original Star Trek universe, mini-homages to fans of TOS. Also very nice is the very efficient way they split the JJ Abrams Trek into a new timeline/reality, thus not risking the wrath of TOS fans. This clean-cut also opens up the possibility of more ""visitors"" from the original Trek timeline/reality in future movies without ""ruining"" TOS :)",1261785600,2009-12-26

Braces on his legs. But he charmed the pants off Nixon and won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retarded. Peter Sellers, ""Being There."" Infantile, yes. Retarded, no. You went full retard, man. Never go full retard. You don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, ""I Am Sam."" Remember? Went full retard, went home empty handed...""They have the wild card, the brains, the fool, the rebel they need the cool. Get a dumb joke, make him really good at reading people, add him to the mix. Three awkwars is too many. But aside from that, the Indian actor who plays that character brings down the entire show, look at his face it is soooooo forced. Just brings down the rest of the cast.Fix it. Remove the indian actor add the ""dumb jock"" archtype and you have a show.",1367020800,2013-04-27
5.0,"First, no television show could possibly recreate for viewers exactly how things are inside an OMC (outlaw motorcycle club). I think that SoA goes as far as it can in the re-creation but then, by necessity, stops. An example of that would be how the family atmosphere inside Samcro is overly sugar coated in some scenes. On the other hand, showing the sweeter side of the club members is essential to developing their characters. How well that is done may be reflected in the eventual success or failure of this show.Sons of Anarchy is good entertainment if you aren't too picky about occasional scenes that are just plain vulgar. You'll also have to be able to tolerate characters such as Tig, who is being revealed bit-by-bit as a more complicated character than many viewers would have suspected earlier in the season. I cannot forget or forgive that was Tig who said, ""No wonder I beat up hookers,"" when he was feeling exasperated by Gemma. But it seems the real threat from him isn't to hookers, it is the level of resistance he has against Jaz's attempts to legitimize the club. That may show an even darker side of Tig than we have already seen.I can't wait until next season!! By the way, in case you don't know, each episode of SoA is available for purchase for less than $2 here on amazon.",1227744000,2008-11-27

1.0,"I loved this show but Abbey is going over the top.  Her behavior is bordering on emotional abuse and bullying of children.  People were outraged over last Tammi on last year's season of Basketball Wives.  Abbey is getting pretty close and she's pulling her antics on CHILDREN.  What kind of example is being set for them??? Is this like Lance Armstrong syndrome, that you do whatever to win???? That they have to be in abusive situations to be on a winning team?  I'll have to pass on this show from now on.

In the end, Vic and Aceveda form an alliance that benefits each other -- for the time being.Even though at this point the series has run the gamut and is heading for an end, it is still 'must see' viewing.  Like a soap opera of life unfolding in front of your face, The Shield and Farmington Division are part of an effort for FX to provide very sharp work to the masses.Great job to those folks who were believers of the network before it had a chance to fold.",1397174400,2014-04-11

You don't go down a category 5 rapids with a boat you've never tried and without experience. I know these guys have done many stunts but I wonder if they are really trained for this.

4.0,"Prison Break returns for its fourth and final season, a season filled with the kind of high-octane action and wonderful characters that this show is known for. Prison Break is one of the best shows FOX has aired in a long time, and it was sad to see it go.The season opens with Michael (Wentworth Miller) tracking down Mahone (William Fichtner), Whistler (Chris Vance), and Gretchen (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) to avenge the death of his beloved Sara (Sarah Wayne Callies). However, once he finds Gretchen, the truth isn't what it originally seemed. Partial secrets are revealed, and a mysterious new player appears.Soon after, Michael and Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) are pursued by a Homeland Security agent, who wants to blackmail them into doing his dirty work for him. Michael and Lincoln agree to the agent's demands. The majority of the season then tells about the intricate operation they work on for the agent, and Michael and Lincoln's attempt to avoid being returned to prison.The show slowly grows to a thrilling climax, where many familiar Prison Break faces return. However, Michael's story doesn't end as perfectly as many fans would have liked.Every performance this season is amazing, as it is in the previous seasons. The characters leap off the screen with their lush, realistic feel. Every actor in this show completely embodies their character.  Miller is a hard-edged, driven actor who draws you into the character's world. His chemistry with Purcell is amazing. The two characters show strong bonds of brotherhood and help get another through the crazy happenings in their lives.This DVD set includes a decent collection of extras, such as two featurettes on the series and its ending and commentary soundtracks for some of the episodes. While I really enjoyed the commentary tracks that exist, it would be far better to have them on all the episodes. I know that there are 22 episodes here, but surely there could be more commentary for the final season? It is also a little surprising that there aren't any deleted or extended scenes from the season. Really, that's part of the reason for getting your favorite TV shows on DVD -- to see more of what was originally filmed for each episode.The biggest issues I have with this release is actually the packaging. I know that sounds a little picky, but the transparent, thin plastic seems cheap and tacky to me -- not to mention it doesn't seem like it will protect the discs very well in the long term. Of course, this new packaging does make the set considerably thinner and lighter, but I somewhat miss the look and feel of the older packaging styles (call me old-fashioned).Season four of Prison Break didn't make every fan happy -- in fact, some fans thought that the series should have ended after the third season. I think that this season was a good ending to the series, filled with edge-of-your-seat intensity, and amazing performances.  I definitely recommend it.",1245974400,2009-06-26
3.0,"I think Browsers could be a great musical movie, or maybe a Broadway stage production to later become a movie, especially given Bebe Neuwirth's stage experience, and she shows it well in this Devil Wears Prada for the online crowd.  It would make a good 2-3 hour stage play about the interns having a week or two to make it in the business, sort of a modern day ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"".  Unfortunately, this would not work as a TV series.  Cop Rock and Smash didn't last, but Dr. Horrible worked because it was a three episode Web series that lasted an hour in total.  And Glee?  Remember they do versions of popular songs and few originals.  So to write a new song or two per episode?  That is asking way too much and it will get tired fast.  So I would suggest Amazon not green light this show but those behind the show consider making a movie.  Raising funds through Kickstarter could make it happen.",1369008000,2013-05-20

5.0,"By now those who watch know who the judges are. But i will get to that shortly. The show is as they say ""the biggest cooking contest in the world today"".  Hell's Kitchen is in it's 11th season, and now casting for its 12th season. So I don't believe yelling or screaming has anything to do with whether it is a good show or worth watching or not.  In this country, they are so money hungry (tv stations), they take shows off just after 11 episodes no matter how great the show or actors (Monday Mornings, TNT).  The format is the same. You have Joe, Graham, and who is considered the best chef in the world today, Gordon Ramsay. Gordon presently has 21 Restaurants and 15 Stars if google was correct.The chefs seem to be better.  They seem to have really went for the throat in this season, getting rid of people who they thought were not meant for the contest even while they were still cooking in a challenge. Joe still getting angry and throwing out the people's plates right into the garbage.  Gordon, while not yelling, is as insulting as ever and it's great. Graham is just a really nice and great guy who just tells it as it is.The food seems to be more complex early in this season. And from the commercials, it seems they will have many more interesting challenges. The only thing that is very predictable is that they hardly ever give Graham the final word on who stays. Yes on some. But what they do is have for example, Joe says No, then Graham you just know is going to say yes to the contestant, so its up to Gordon. Then it goes the other way. Gordon says yes, Graham says no, then its up to Joe. I wish they would give more decision making to Graham.  He is young and and on fire with two Stars now, the second given for his take on Pea Soup, and he cooked for the president of the United States, so he is climbing fast as a chef. Not the star of the show, which is Gordon Ramsay himself, but He is one of the youngest best chef's in the country today. It was a great job for the casting.  They really needed Graham for this show to give it a ease, and some humor.I think if you have liked this show in the past you will really love this season. Everything just seems to be more fast paced, food more complex, and it seems to me that we are left with very good home chef's early in the season. Which i think will make for an interesting 4th season, and with all the shows Gordon has and the years his shows have been on, it's obvious the country loves the show and for good reasons.  enjoy and have fun with it...",1370217600,2013-06-03

1.0,"I thought this would be a nice little film about what to eat and how to get healthy as a vegan. Not so much. I should have known when they went to the grocery store and she was showing them what was and wasn't considered a vegan product. Did you know Oreo's are vegan? Yep! Wow, and so healthy for you...  That's when I realized the film maker wasn't so much interested in spreading a message about how to get healthy eating as a vegan, but was more interested in proving that eating animal products was contributing to animal cruelty. Yeah, and don't even get me started on all the soy crap they ""discover"". Soy is not a health food, people!!Personally, I already know all about how animals raised for food are treated. I read ""Diet For a New America"" many years ago and it totally opened my eyes. I was not interested in seeing that again. I understand that she wanted to prove a point, but I don't like the idea of forcing people to see that sort of thing without a warning to begin with. It felt like the filmmaker's only justification for being a vegan was the fact that animals raised as food are treated badly. It wasn't about health at all. The message I got was ""become a vegan so no more animals have to suffer"".And, if you don't know anything else, you're going to watch this and believe that ALL food animals are treated inhumanely.I had to stop watching this movie about half-way through, so maybe it isn't fair of me to give it a review, but I think it's important that other people know before going in, what's in store for them. It wasn't what I thought, and I don't want that message forced down my throat. I'd rather watch ""Food, Inc."" I thought it was a million times better than this.",1338681600,2012-06-03

No, it doesn't explain EVERYTHING, but with a little thought and insight, this movie can be greatly rewarding. If you only like movies that lead you by the hand to all the answers, or all the main characters (good guys anyway) live or at least save the day in the end, or have a billion dollars in special effects, then this movie probably isn't for you. I, for one, have watched it over and over, and I'm here now looking to buy a copy to download to my kindle fire so I can take it with me on a plane.

3.0,Glades is an enjoyable watch because the actors play interesting characters and do it well. The surprising thing is that after watching 4 shows I now know how to fully predict each story. The writer's formula is overly simplistic and repetitive.  Humor saves most scenes and in the middle of a weak thread we get to like the main characters and actually care about them. There just needs to be a bit more intrigue and mystery than currently exists.  We'll see how the seasons develop.,1403049600,2014-06-18

I watched the entire second season in a few days - watching 3-4 episodes at a time. That's when I found out it had been cancelled. I don't like watching shows, no matter how great, that only have a season or two. Alphas left me wanting more - I want to know how the characters continue to develop, what new characters come into play, where the storyline goes, and what happened after the season-ending cliffhanger. I'm disappointed, to say the least. But if you're in the camp of &#34;better to have loved and lost...&#34; then by all means watch Alphas.

5.0,"Though I was captivated by the series right from the start, as the seasons progressed it only became more engrossing. I thought that Season Three really took off, and felt that anything attempted beyond that would be a let down. Alas! Season 4 tops them all for the depth of presented ideas, characterization, and adrenalin raising action.THough there were, I believe, 77 episodes in the series, as I approached the final episodes I felt a close friend was packing and departing from me. Then, in keeping with that feeling of loss, the final episode brought, I thought, the reality of life for us all to the center, and that is exactly how any production that &#34;holds the mirror up to nature&#34; as well as this series did should have ended.

It wasn't funny and even as a dark comedy it just didn't interest me at all.  The characters were some of the most boring I have seen and don't care about any of them.  Terrible show!!!!!!,1391644800,2014-02-06

4.0,"While this series hasn't reached the level as its predecessor overall the series does grow in entertainment and quality per episode, especially as we get some screen time with some of the other background characters in the series as well.  While the Wraith remain the primary enemy on the series we also get some intrusion from past enemies as well from G'aould to the Replicators as well as some cameo time from some of the SG1 team members too.  While Shepard is no Jack O'Neill he has started getting his own personality it seems that fits the series well and while the super model leader Teyla still feels unneeded she has become somewhat less annoying in the series as well.  If you have the Stargate series I say for the price these sets are going for that it's a pretty good bargain to add the five seasons of Stargate Atlantis to the shelf as well....",1348704000,2012-09-27

2.0,"The show is based on a book series called &#34;women of the otherworld&#34;.  I'm assuming the novels are written for teenage girls-- it would explain why Elena is the center of everyone's universe.  It would also explain her terrible dialog: &#34;You raised an amazing son&#34; &#34;It's gonna be an amazing wedding&#34; &#34;Your outfit is amazing&#34;.  More on Black Hole Sue later.I actually liked the first episodes a lot.  It's an interesting idea to have people transform into wolves and not some horrible monster.  I also liked how they acted like a pack.  The meal couldn't begin until Jeremy had the first bite, and there was a scene where he's looking out a window, watching his pack &#34;play&#34;.  It was interesting sociologically to look at a group of people modeling their lives after wolves.  I also liked the idea of the Mutts.  Without an alpha, dogs and wolves are unpredictable and dangerous.  In other words, I bought in fully to the premise and I thought this may be my new favorite show.After the first few episodes, it became unwatchable, mainly because everything was about Elena and making her happy.  When Elena is in Toronto, the camera shows us what's happening without her in Stonehaven.  The pack is all &#34;What's up with Elena?&#34;  &#34;How can we get Elena back?&#34;  &#34;We need to give Elena her space&#34; &#34;How can we make life easier for Elena?&#34;.  Now the camera does indeed go to Toronto:  Elena is having sex with her human fianc&eacute;, and afterwards she engages in pillow talk. (one of the only times her constant whispering makes sense)  However, Elena has a secret and scurries off leaving the fianc&eacute; alone.  Now it's the fianc&eacute;'s turn to ask &#34;What's up with Elena?&#34;  &#34;How can I get Elena back?&#34;  &#34;How can I make life easier for Elena?&#34;And why are all the men obsessed with her?  She's self obsessed and is always threatening to leave the pack or disappear on Philip.  She seems to have no personality.  Actually, her personality is to wear pricey outfits, talk about herself all the time (in a constant whisper) and complain.  Elena is the most boring and self involved person I can ever remember watching.  She's basically a fourteen year old girl.And it's only fitting to put Black Hole Sue in a love triangle.  The fianc&eacute; has a high paying job, short and professional hair, a sculpted physique and is the &#34;safe&#34; choice.  Clay is dangerous.  You can tell because he has long hair.  Are such stereotypical love triangles mandated now?  Haven, Once Upon a Time after season one, Witches of East End.... Terrible shows I wouldn't be caught dead watching.The wolves look like the old star wars special effects.  However, that played no part in my rating.If Elena was a secondary character and the series was instead about the Pack, it'd be an interesting show.  It's comical how the show can't go five minutes without everyone obsessing over a chick with the personality of a door knob.  Even the diddler was obsessed with her.The diddler was probably the most interesting character on the show.  I actually found myself rooting for him to slay Clay, Phillip, and especially Elena.  I'm not at all surprised this got a second season.  Just like Once Upon A Time, the worse the writing and acting gets, the more people seem to like it.",1405123200,2014-07-12
5.0,"When an episode of ""Intervention"" covers two individuals, I usually find one person's story compelling and the other's negligible.  This episode showed two stand-out people.  I think a student could write a great paper comparing and contrasting the two.  Both interviewees have troubled and troubling father-son issues, but otherwise, they'll be seen as quite different.  Honestly, I think Middle America will relate to one and not the other.Josh is morbidly obese.  But he's a straight, white, probably middle-class guy.  Unlike many a lonely, fat dude, he does have a woman in his life though they are called broken up here.  Josh's father is one of those ""My house, my rules!"" tyrannical fathers.  The work never says anything about it, but it's funny to me that his father is named Rex, which means ""king"" in Latin.  A study suggested that although we fat men look jolly and good-natured, we're mostly angry and possessed with many a demon.  I soooo wanted to hug Josh, but also get him on a treadmill at the same time.  Josh's two younger brothers were thin and unfortunately it's never spelled out how they avoided Josh's and Rex's predicaments.I personally am fascinated about when biraciality and bisexuality intersect.  Ben is biracial and could be called bisexually-active.  I wish the show discussed his identity(ies) with him, but it didn't.  It struck me that he was passionate about books on European history, but I wonder if he'd enjoy ethnic studies or LGBT studies texts.  Unfortunately, Ben seemed like a terrible waste of gifts.  He has a 170 IQ, but his other traits present him as the stereotypical tragic mulatto.  We see him eating discarded food and laughing at garbage removal.  He sleeps in a damp basement.  Along with his unique identities, he was addicted to a unique drug, something called DMX which is over the counter.  Ben has a bruise near one eye and we never learn why: was he punched?  did he fall?  is it a lesion?  Speaking of tragic mulatto, he tries to sneak services from a prostitute and then acts surprised when her pimp retaliates.  Initially, I asked myself if this is an example of the furor in the African-American community about ""the down low.""  However, Ben spoke freely of prostituting himself and even his mother knew about it.  Ben is seen with a chubby, cute GBM named Todd, a former client.  As mentioned, identity matters are not discussed, but I wonder if Ben could turn his life around if he had more Black, gay mentors or peers like Todd.Again, I think most viewers would relate to Josh and not Ben.  However, I could list many ways in which it's the Bens of the world who are the most oppressed and need our support the most.  I saw another TV installment which suggested that Josh is really changing things and headed in the right direction.  However, in line with tragic mulatto tropes, this episode concludes with a lack of good news for Ben.This is one of my favorite episodes of ""Intervention.""  I really encourage everyone to view it and think deeply on its contents.",1310688000,2011-07-15

4.0,"This is what marks a well-crafted film and by that I mean developing your central characters at the outset (so that the viewer cares what happens to them in the following 90 minutes) then placing them within an interesting and credible situation, suddenly bring everything crashing down and next thing you know you're completely invested in a survival situation (reminiscent of those classic disaster films) only to introduce spooky events that takes it all careening sideways into bone-chilling horror.There is something fundamentally creepy about deep underground (an underused horror milieu) and I believe ""Beneath"" is extremely effective at placing the viewer in the moment; allowing us to feel just as cut off and occasionally claustrophobic as the people we're watching.  I also love a good group-oriented monster/disaster survival film (e.g. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or ""The Abyss"") and this movie definitely conveys that sort of feel as well, not to mention some exceptionally charged performances, which I suspect will go largely unnoticed in an under-the-radar horror flick.There may be lots of lurid and or disturbing films coming out of the genre these days but not much in the legitimately frightening department (""The Conjuring"" being an exception) but ""Beneath"" is very reminiscent of something from the glory days of John Carpenter and I personally could care less how big or small a budget this movie had because it's A-list horror all the way with some serious thrills and scares and a decent rewatchability factor to boot.

5.0,"Sure, we have the creators of this show that came up with the concept and, to be sure, there are the characters that bring the show to life... but who really have the brains overall? Believe it or not, even though they're total brainiacs, it's not Sheldon or his totally egotistic roommate Sheldon (who has issues galore), I do believe it's their blonde neighbor, Penny, who definitely knows how to portray common sense effectively. And in each episode, where misadventures fire up all the time, I couldn't help but laugh my jaw off at each antic, especially the failed tactics of the live person counterpart of Pepy Lepew- Howard Horowitz. Almost felt like I needed a death certificate for laughing so hard each time.As for Sheldon's attitude and cold, distant, nonpersonal way... I laughed real hard at what happens to him at the Physics Bowl (who would've guessed a janitor could actually be smart?). Not to mention Rajesh finding a way to actually talk to women (make that two, though I don't think the side effects will be wanted), oh, and can't forget Leslie Winkler and her forward, somewhat off-putting, yet very well-done character as the female version of the guys. And the chemistry between Leonard and Penny may be obvious, but it also works, very, very well. It's not blaring, it works equally with all the nerdish humor- his intelligence and awkwardness with her charm and ditziness. And if this is just the start-up, then let the bigger laughs begin when I get to season 2.",1342483200,2012-07-17
5.0,"Wow, what a pilot.  I found this show to be refreshing and well made and left me dangling with suspense throughout most of the show.  I can't wait for more shows to air.  Although this show seemed somewhat  similar to other story lines, the characters depth brought out an earnest desire to know more about each of them and how they will cooperate (or not) through this seemingly apocalyptic crisis.  I was uncertain about watching this pilot after seeing the first few minutes of an elevator scene that gets trapped with no power and harkened me back to many other movies with the same plot.  However, once I realized this wasn't going to be a &#34;Trapped in an Elevator&#34; movie I was doubly intrigued.  This show had me on the tips of my toes with me empathizing with the characters and finding a piece of society in each person depicted.  Please show more!

5.0,"Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: Yes, Scarlett Johansson is nude in this film. She is fully frontal nude. Ok, post-pubescent testosterone-driven audiences, go on the internet and find screen caps and then go see TRANSFORMERS for a fifth time, because if that's why you're watching this film, you're going to be one of the haters.However, if you're in the mood to see a proto-sci-fi film about the allegorical birth, life and death of an unearthly being in a very Kubrickian fashion, UNDER THE SKIN should be a perfect fit for you.As directed by Jonathan Glazer (SEXY BEAST, BIRTH) the film follows our protagonist, as played by Johansson, as she travels around the Scottish countryside in a white van to seduce men and abduct them for what seem to be extremely nefarious and alien reasons. Almost all of the seduction scenes are set against a completely black backdrop as the men sink into a black abyss all while she's protected and guided by a mysterious motorcyclist. She meets a terribly disfigured young man, and suddenly, this emotionless sexual predator starts to feel things that make no sense to her; feelings like compassion and mercy. This leads her off her mission and into the presence of another man who takes her in, not understanding who she is or what she's capable of. The film ends in on a very strange, almost TWILIGHT ZONE-esque note which is disturbing, but makes a perverted sort of sense when you think about it.Those who may have read the book might be very upset by this film as it seems to be, at least thematically, quite different. The film is very much about birth, life and death in both a very figurative and literal way. When we first meet our protagonist (none of the characters in the film have names, and much of the dialogue is improvised), she is nude (as the day she was born) and is undressing the body of a recently deceased young woman and putting on her clothes. As she journeys her way through the film, at first, she's just doing exactly what's expected of her, but once she starts to feel a twinge of self-awareness, she begins to stray. In the aforementioned nude scene, she seems to just be examining her body in an entirely unsexualized manner. Of course we're aware of her beauty, but this character isn't. And this plays unusually well to Johansson's strengths as a performer, considering that one of her main strengths, as proven by Spike Jonze's magical HER, is her voice. But she's an extremely physical actress as well, and using her body, face and eyes to let you in makes this one of her best screen performances.Glazer takes quite a few cues from Kubrick and directs the film with extremely minimal dialogue, with an incredibly unsettling and gorgeous score by Mica Levi, and allows the camera and the character's eyes and body language to tell the story instead. This is bound to be unsettling for viewers who are completely used to a standard linear narrative, and hence, many of the 1-star reviews of this film seem to be from viewers that just aren't on board with this kind of cinematic storytelling. I can't really argue with them; it's a very jarring and unsettling experience and for those who are fed on a strict Hollywood diet, they're going to be upset by this film.But for those who are willing to take the leap into what is an extremely unusual film experience, UNDER THE SKIN is a modern masterwork of minimalist cinema.",1405555200,2014-07-17

4.0,"While this is a review for the first and, sadly, the only season of J.J. Abrams' ALCATRAZ, this will also be, in part, a rant against Fox Broadcasting and how quickly they forgot their roots.Let's begin with the review though. First, a quick rundown of the plot: Back in March of 1963, Alcatraz officially closed. All the prisoners were transferred to other prisons. This is the official story, but it's not the way it happened. In actuality, 256 inmates of Alcatraz as well as 46 guards mysteriously vanished and no one knows where... until now, that is. Mysterious and shadowy Federal Agent Emerson Hauser (the terrifically underrated Sam Neill) appears in San Francisco just around the time that our main protagonist SFPD Detective Rebecca Madsen (the talented and lovely Sarah Jones, who doesn't have a lot of credits to her name) loses her partner to a fleeing suspect. Madsen comes into direct contact and conflict with what Agent Hauser is trying to do when two men are murdered in the same day by a man who was one of the vanishing convicts and also looks exactly the same as he did in 1963. Enlisted in the search for this killer is the cuddly, lovable and very intelligent comic geek man-child Dr. Diego Soto (Jorge Garcia aka Hurley from LOST) who is considered to have written the definitive works on Alcatraz and its inmates. Along with Hauser's assistant, Dr. Lucy Banerjee (the talented and lovely Parminder Nagra, who first made a splash as the co-star of BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM and then onto ER), they form something of a secret task force to find the rest of the missing ""63's"".However, as with LOST, we have flashbacks as well to when the prison was still active, and secrets aplenty during that timeframe, kept primarily by Warden Edwin James (a terrific Jonny Coyne), who is a man of seemingly infinite patience and a sadistic streak a mile wide. Also joining the cast from time to time is Ray Archer (the great Robert Forster), who is Rebecca's uncle and a former guard at Alcatraz who ALSO has some secrets in his past. The cast is terrific, and the characters as we come to know them are extremely engaging. The scene-stealer though is always Coyne as Warden James, who has a kindly and almost beatific smile while he's twisting the knife even further into his inmates. His presence alone is tremendously unnerving.The big questions, as with LOST (which is really the best analogue for this show), are who, what,  where and why: What is responsible for the disappearences; Who are some of these escapees working for; Where did they go; and of course, Why is all of this happening? Sadly, unlike LOST, this was a program that had a pretty big start but viewership cooled enough that by the end of the first season, despite a really terrific thirteen episodes and one heck of a season finale, Fox decided to drop it, leaving far too many questions unanswered, namely all of the ones I just listed.Now, I can understand that there are a few problems with this show that need to be addressed, and probably would have been improved upon in the second season. First and most importantly is that this show, while being a lot like LOST, wasn't quite enough like LOST. Over the past several years, there have been a glut of procedural crime thrillers/dramas that have come down the TV pipelines and one that has a sci-fi ""what if"" type of concept wasn't quite enough to differentiate itself from the dozens of others that are still on, for good (BURN NOTICE, PERSON OF INTEREST) or ill (any incarnation of LAW AND ORDER, CSI, or NCIS). Secondly, the show, being only 13 episodes, making way for a mid-season replacement if it wasn't up to snuff for the network that has the biggest show on right now and the lowest production costs (AMERICAN IDOL... argh) needed one of those answers answered. LOST was such a brilliant show all the way up through the end (despite the legions of nay-sayers) because it owned its strangeness and it gave us a large number of characters that we cared about. ALCATRAZ, because it took a procedual drama tack in the midst of all the bizarre goings-on, lost part of that edge and started to lose viewership because the characters were sparse and we just weren't terribly invested in Rebecca Madsen's life because the show wasn't invested either. One thing the show absolutetly did right though was understanding that this was a show that lived and died by its main characters, and while the life of Det. Madsen wasn't very interesting, the lives of Hauser and Doc were interesting enough to keep a forward momentum going. You didn't simply love Doc because he was Hurley from LOST; this was a new character with a new backstory and Garcia really makes the most of it. Sam Neill plays the hell out of Hauser as well. Being a cryptic and mysterious Fed seems to be a staple of J.J. Abrams TV, and he really works this character hard to the point where you care about him despite the fact that he's not very likable.So while I believe that this show didn't fail from a story, script or acting standpoint, the major letdown was that it didn't let its freak flag fly, like FRINGE or LOST did. ALCATRAZ was pretty darn good television, but it also just wasn't ambitious enough.Fox obviously has a history of doing this to better shows than this, such as EVERY program that had the name Tim Minear as a producer/creator (FIREFLY being the most glaring example, but also his other shows he was involved in like THE INSIDE, DRIVE, and THE CHICAGO CODE), and a great many other shows in favor of its more insipid programs like AMERICAN IDOL, SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE?, and any number of the other ""reality"" flavored brands it has out there. FRINGE was it for a really long time and that's getting axed too, but that could simply be because it ran its course. But what Fox doesn't remember is its roots. The show that really seemed to put Fox on the map and make it Stay-at-home viewing was THE X-FILES. It was the ultimate slow-burn show, ratings-wise, and it gave this network a name and a brand. Sadly, the show did decline severely in its last two years, but there's no reason that a show like SVU can stay on for 15 seasons and shows like ALCATRAZ only get one, and not even a complete one at that. This show might have found a better home elsewhere, but I guess we'll never know.All in all, for people who actually watched this show when it was on, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the episodes again, but for people just experiencing this for the first time on home video, ALCATRAZ might be an exercise in fuming frustration and leave you screaming for answers after you watch the last episode.That's not to say that it's not worth the scream.",1341100800,2012-07-01
3.0,"Following the success, warm reviews and award accolades galore for her debut feature Away From Her, actress Sarah Polley has return with her second feature as writer and director. While not a masterpiece like her earlier triumph, Take This Waltz still manages to have enough interest and ambition to make it a worthy, if not a remarkable follow up. The outer crust is rich, but I suspect the inside to be hollow. Which comes as something of a shame, but I think Polley will continue to grow as a filmmaker and should defiantly remain on everyone's radar.Set in Polley's native Toronto, and following Margot (Michelle Williams) and Lou (Seth Rogen), a young married couple old before their time. She, a bored wife writing tedious travel brochures, he a would-be chief working on a thriller of a book regarding the many ways to prepare a chicken dinner. Margot has a chance meeting with a handsome stranger (Luke Kirby) while on assignment, a meet cute that follows her onto the airplane trip back home ,and grows all the more awkward when they realize that they are close neighbors. He is Daniel and he leads a more carefree existence that easily attracts the attention, but more slowly is the affections of Margot. Not wanting a full blown love affair to bloom, Margot still finds herself being drawn to the more adventures and relaxed Daniel. Meanwhile Lou remains tamely unaware, with a further conflict developing involving his alcoholic sister, Geraldine (Sarah Silverman).Polley is a fine actress who hasn't always landed the plum juicy roles that she deserves, in fact it surprises me more than a little that she hasn't cast herself in any of the strong roles in one of her own films, yet. She is also a first rate director, one who understands how to direct actors, that was keenly evident in her debut feature, there is still a difference of opinion over weather Julie Christie was robbed of an Oscar win or not, but is even more so here.  This movie succeeds in spit of it's pretensions and often lumbering plotting thanks to the excellent performances.Michelle Williams is adorable as always, smart and assured playing the sort of character she's becoming a specialist in, I suspect that a lot of people will recall Blue Valentine when watching this film. The real kudos, though, must go to Seth Rogen, who is nicely cast against type, in a role that will seem familiar to many people. His Lou has done nothing wrong, he's just an observer in his own life story. The tenderness and sadness that Rogen brings to the role helps to show something I have seen before in the actor, but has largley been left neglected and that is that he's actually a pretty good actor. Also well cast is comedian Sarah Silverman who has finally found a film role worthy of her talent.The movie is also highlighted by a nifty soundtrack featuring a lott of indie rock and alternative music. Which should come as little surprise as the film was inspired by the moody song of the same name by legendary Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, it is not as richly texture or as poetic as the song. The movie is also unfortunately lacking in the wit that can often be found in so much of Cohen's beautiful and deeply felt music. A cool place to find inspiration for a film though, see what I mean about the keen insight that Polley brings to her films.The frustrations and boredom in Margot's life is the centerpiece of the movie, told in such a low key way, to the point of banality, which probably is the point. It leaves the events of the picture to unfold a little on the stodgy side. At almost two hours it is a little long as well, a censored version released  in Canada runs 91 minutes, one must wonder if that versions play better.Take This Waltz resembles nothing more than a big budgeted mumble core movie, you know those films that are famously underwritten and developed with amateur performances and dialogue thought up on the fly, but with everyone having sex and getting naked at the drop of a hat. The sex is toned down, and Polley's script is better than that,  but the characterizations are certainty more facile. There's often not enough to sustain a real interest here, but the emotional content is strong particularly towards the ending confrontations, most of which unfold to the contraire of expectations.An uneven film for sure dealing with issues familiar to the indie drama crowd, Take This Waltz fails to avoid clich&eacute;. I have already mentioned Williams' Oscar nominated triumph in the superb Blue Valentine, which I'm sure that this will conjure up memories of that admittedly superior film. Polley's film lacks the deep perspective of that film which helped to make it so afflicting and memorable. However, the cast rises above the material, and Polley has left her script rich enough for them to find something to say even when they have nothing left to speak of. This is the ultimate success of this small, but thoughtful enough film.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1359504000,2013-01-30

5.0,"This is the best buddy cop show on TV, hands down, and the future tech is a nice side benefit. Karl Urban is brilliant and Michael Ealy is close behind. The cases  they solve make good use of the future tech and society without becoming overly reliant on gadgets; in the end, it all comes down to good detective work. The show is smart, witty, and wry. Excellent writing, high production values. I hope it stay true to the promise it's showing this first season.",1388102400,2013-12-27
4.0,"I enjoy this show, although I think the romantic (or sexual) tension between the lead actors is not there.  The female lead is leading the male around by the nose.  I do not truly enjoy a weak man, but that's just me.  I like the detecting portion of the show, and the other characters are great.  The female boss, the intern and the morgue doctor are great characters.  The detective is fun, when he is not with the female lead.",1401321600,2014-05-29

5.0,"Note: Amazon first made Series 3&4 available via streaming (free for Prime members) several months ago, and another fan of the series made it known to me that Series One and Two are now available via streaming (free for Prime members).Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis on ""Inspector Morse"", is now Detective Inspector Lewis in ""Inspector Lewis"", a high quality investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).Season 2 of Inspector Lewis is quite an engaging series, containing many interesting episodes featuring DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) and DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox). Part of what makes Insp. Lewis a charming series for me is the banter between Lewis and the more cerebral, Cambridge-educated (in theology), Hathaway. There's lots to satisfy the discerning viewer in Season 2 - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast.Season 2 contains the following episodes:And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garrotted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.I'd recommend the Inspector Lewis series to any fan of quality British crime procedurals.",1333843200,2012-04-08

4.0,"This is a twisted movie, so don't go in expecting something thought provoking or a traditional horror flick. It's mostly a comedy. I was more amused than scared. It goes over the top quite a bit, but it's designed that way. Some of the characters are hilarious, like the two chain smoking priests, and the &#34;neighbor&#34; who lives in the crawlspace of the innocent couple who move into the haunted house. The main character is also quite funny. A super nice guy who tries to make the best of things, no matter how bizarre they get. This movie goes from absurd to ridiculous, and is a perfect fit for people who like this type of entertainment, like a Monty Python, or Team America fan.",1381536000,2013-10-12

4.0,"A trio of strong performances highlights this three-character thriller from England.  The film wastes no time in establishing its familiar kidnapping scenario.It's what happens once Alice is taken that elevates it beyond the routine crime caper.  There are some unexpected plot twists and an unexpected climax.  Gemma Arterton's Alice is a complex victim, and she does extremely good job in a difficult role.  Martin Compston is Danny, the ""gentler"" kidnapper dominated by his older partner.  He uses his boyish charm to belie his darker nature.  But it is Eddie Marsan as the mastermind who dominates the film.  Marsan's inspired performance gives us both the hardened pro and the softer, almost pathetic side.  A performance of depth and complexity.ALICE CREED is not always easy to watch but it is good movie-making.",1301356800,2011-03-29

5.0,"Did women really wear their hair this way in 1966. That sight alone on two of the lead females was worth the price of admission. The guys, too, while not quite matching the girls in quaintness to 2010 eyes, came in a close second with those shrunken fedoras they sport throughout.Starting with these laughs which were unplanned when the film was made, there are many more in this Bob Hope vehicle, which relies more on old-fashioned slapstick than on the typical Hope gags. While having little more to do than show her body, deliver a few accented lines, and be somewhat manhandled in closeups unsuitable to a stunt double, Elke Sommer still more than earned her pay by just being second banana to Hope. Phyllis Diller, a frequent support player to Hope in his various comedy venues in those years, does her particular thing well. True she was an acquired taste, as they say, but in this film, she does provide some fun. The remainder of the supporting cast do what is required of them to give the star his laughs. Hope, himself, nearing the end of his film career, has better material and, therefore, more laughs than some of the other films he made as it became only a marginal activity to being America's favorite comic here and abroad. At this time, he had something like one-third of the twenty all time hit shows on TV with his specials devoted to his entertainment of the troops, most recently in Viet Nam, where a bitter struggle was rapidly escalating.So for many good laughs, no irony or wit, no character development, no symbolic meanings, a story line just strong enough to carry the sight and sound gags, I can, still laughing, recommend this as feather-light, totally escape, viewing.",1273968000,2010-05-16
4.0,Pretty ridiculous but ultimately I laughed out loud quite a few times. It's not a thinker but very enjoyable. I'd definitely watch it again.

3.0,"Oh, man. This was a show I really wanted to love. It has two of my favorite actors, Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy. It has a solid supporting cast with the likes of Natalie Zea, Annie Parrise and Shawn Ashmore. It seemed to have a solid plot.However, in THE FOLLOWING, Fox's latest attempt to get more ""edgy"", it bludgeons the viewer with every single possible cliche in almost every episode. It's a veritable clown car of character tropes, red herrings, laughably bad dialogue, abysmal plotting, and narcoleptic performances.Here's the plot: Ryan Hardy (Bacon) is a former FBI profiler who was once involved with the chase, and ultimately the capture, of charismatic college professor and failed writer (and co-ed serial killer) Joe Carroll (Purefoy), whose killings have the shared theme of Edgar Allan Poe-style murders. Hardy is wounded badly in the capture and now has a pacemaker. Since the capture, he's drowned himself in alcohol and wrote a book about the Carroll case. Suddenly, Carroll escapes his maximum-facility incarceration and intends to continue his murder spree with his ""following""; a cult of various murderous misanthropes who have all been bitten by the crazy bug. Hardy is brought back into the fray, so that Carroll can continue his game of cat and mouse with Hardy, but with Carroll's followers, all who have impossibly played out various roles of importance to Hardy and the people around him, remain one step ahead. It's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS meets The Manson Family.Showrunner Kevin Williamson, who rightly made a name for himself with the SCREAM films, has very little faith in the target audience for a show of this type. It's a consistent insult to the intelligence of those who watch the show as the FBI and Hardy stumble around like the Keystone Kops, feebly attempting to quell the murders, but also to save Carroll's ex-wife (Zea) who Ryan is in love with, and Carroll's son. It's as if none of the pursuing forces have more than three or four brain cells functioning at any given time, EXCEPT when the plot requires them to suddenly become brilliant.With maybe the exception of Purefoy, every cast member, especially Bacon, seems to just be cashing a check here. Bacon has never EVER been as dull as his performance is in this show. Even he seems to be asking himself, ""Why am I in this idiotic show?"" as he lumbers from plot point to plot point. Purefoy at least seems like he's having some fun here playing Hannibal Lec... ahem... I mean, Joe Carroll as he chews his way through most of the scenery in the show.So why three stars? Because at the end of every episode, after I've been screaming at the television about how stupid the FBI are, I find myself taken with the idea that the series in and of itself is a long-form parody of these types of stories. Williamson was all about playing against the stereotypes while playing with them in SCREAM, and for whatever reason, I believe that this show is somehow totally aware of how bad it is, and is willing to keep making itself more and more idiotic and implausible as the season went on.Either that, or THE FOLLOWING is really one of the worst shows in recent memory. It's probably the latter, but I kind of hope it's the former.",1379548800,2013-09-19
5.0,"Only insignificant spoilers aheadGreat, adult oriented, show. Compelling characters, good acting and great reconstruction of Viking culture. Less bloody than you might expect, though nobody will ever accuse this of being a family-oriented show. The show is based (loosely) on the ancient viking tales of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Viking who may or may not have done all of the things he is given credit for in the writings of the monks and scribes who penned the tales. I warn you to not read too deeply into those tales before you see the series, as it will give you some unwanted (in my case) insights into where major plot lines of the story will go, and the fates of some of the major characters.I was especially pleased with the way in which Ragnar's character is played. He's not a particularly nice fellow - he becomes famous for killing a lot of, often, defenseless people and stealing their stuff. On the other hand, his home-life is shown in a mostly favorable light - good father and provider and such stuff. How can you really be a hero to a modern audience when you slaughter entire monasteries and then get a captive monk drunk and develop a sense of trust with him so that he tells you the locations of other targets to hit? Fortunately the writers don't try to clean up his life-story, or life-style and shows Ragnar and his people as the savage killers they are. Killers with a, sometimes flexible, code of honor, but still killers.Interestingly enough I have figured that this version is a 'cleaned up' edit of what has been shown elsewhere. Having read about the series on some other websites before deciding to watch it, I saw screen shots that did not appear in this version. Evidently it is ok to show axes splitting skulls, but we have to protect little Timmy from any potentially offensive sexual content.In any event, the series was great and my wife and I binge watched through the first season in a weekend. We are very much looking forward to seeing the second season once it becomes available.",1389225600,2014-01-09

It reminds me a bit of Fallen Skies in that we are plopped down in the middle of the story after an alien conflict.  Humans have settled in Saint Louis along with several different species of Aliens, and the show is seemingly about their struggle to survive.  it's mostly shown through the main character and his adopted alien daughter.

When his friend Corey (Peck) crashes his date and asks to stop at the ATM machine he is counting down the minutes till he can get Emily alone. After getting out the cash they turn around and notice a stranger starting at them. Their night takes a deadly turn. To start with this is not a bad movie at all. I like the movies like this where it takes an everyday activity and introduces terror into it. The big problem with this is that after a half hour it seemed to run out of ideas and kept repeating itself over and over. The one thing that really saved this and made it enjoyable was the end. This is not a typical ""Hollywood"" ending and that helped the movie a lot. If you liked ""Devil"" or ""Phonebooth"" then you will also like this one. This is worth a watch. Overall, a tense but also repetitive thriller that is worth watching. Ending is great & disturbing. I give it a B.",1337472000,2012-05-20
4.0,"Even a fantastic comedic actor like Nathan can get a little boring. I think the whole show is getting a little boring. The constant yakking over their wedding plans is just not that interesting. C'mon, even in real life when it's people we care deeply about, wedding plan angst isn't especially interesting. I don't care where Castle & Beckett's venue is. Just pick one and get on with it. This is just one of the situations that is making the show start to drag. To solve this, for starters, I think the writers would do well to involve the supporting actors in the main stories more often and more fully. Let's see Jenny get kidnapped. Let Gates disappear. Let a crazy person hold the precinct police hostage. There is a wealth of interesting possibilities involving supporting actors. Something else that would help the show would be the occasional hot scene between C & B, too, like when Beckett went to Castle's penthouse and they kissed so passionately. And dear God, can we be done with the teenage leering and find *something* alluring for Beckett to say besides, &#34;There's this thing I like to do with ice.&#34; We know, we know. Play up the sexuality of the characters more, especially Beckett. Let her do some undercover stints as a hooker in order to find a murderous pimp. That sort of thing. It's a bit tacky, but it sells, and it would help the show immensely. Writers, please don't let this once-great show become lackluster.

4.0,"This movie asks the question what happened to the ninth legion?  It's a matter debated by scholars which is ongoing and recent opinions of the legion's demise has resettled in Briton.  That said, this movie isn't big on historical treatise and instead focuses on beautiful landscapes (filmed in Scotland) and bloody, brutal battles.  The 9th gets mostly wiped out and then it's a mad escape for a few men from the vengeful pursuit of the Picts.  Fairly good use of a spear by the silent female tracker contrary to what people are saying on here and yes the women did fight with their men.  There are some logical issues in the tale but they aren't serious by the standards of most.  Very impressive that this entire film was made on only ten million dollars.

5.0,"The film captures the essence of the novel (1992 Booker Prize) with a fantastic cast and cinematography. Romance and adventure weave a storyline that can but capture the spirit of this genre. No lengthy review is needed. Complex with the beauty seldom found in a film's interpretation of a novel. 'The English Patient' follows the paths of those brought together before and during the Italian Campaign of World War II.  The relevance of the title comes at the end.  Desert archeologists before the war,  caught up by the events of war and those introduced before victory. Flashbacks tell the story in a way that flows effortlessly.

5.0,"A  nice change from typical TV and its brought back the musical in a sense.  Glee touches on all types of discriminations without focusing too much on the high school model.  In fact, the teachers are some of the best supporting characters, especially Sue Sylvester (who sometimes steals the show) a la Jane Lynch who first stood out for me in ROLE MODELS.  The creators tapped into Broadway stars to pull this one off and it worked.  The nice thing about the songs is that they don't stick to one decade.  In fact, they cover songs that all generations can remember them even if they're all updated.  This is arguably one of the hottest TV shows in several years and the visiting A list actors and actresses supports my stance.  MY GRADE: A minus to A.",1278806400,2010-07-11
5.0,"The other reviewers are absolutely right! This series is phenomenal, its got everything.You know, I expected a bunch of redneck, backward, unsophisticated Cajuns that were rippedfrom society about 50 years ago, man was I wrong. These guys are very bright, know theirbusiness, and use very clever methods to trap and catch their prey and have learned how tomaximize their profits in a short 30 day window where they are allowed to hunt gators. Imean these guys are so relentless one of the cast (Troy) even caught 39 gators in one day!The trick is to get them to market before the Louisiana sun spoils the catch, and for bigcash.One of my favorite episodes was when ""Junior"" agreed to take on a visitor from Italy, aclothing designer, who wanted to go on a hunt. This was pretty funny, as they just calledhim Itally Guy (thats how they spelled it), but he didn't cause too much trouble other thanthe catch was about 1/2 of what they normally expected. Anyway, at the end of the day Juniortold Itally Guy ""get the hell off my property"" in a very nice way and I expect we wont seehim again in future episodes.One of the things that makes this show so good is the sense of urgency, these guys aren'tplaying around and here's why...... at the start of the season, each hunter is allocateda certain number of ""tags"" for each gator they catch. When they run out of tags, theirseason is over. If they don't use all their tags, then the state cuts their allotment oftags for the next season. That makes for great TV!After watching Season 1, I have the ultimate respect for all these men, their families, andthe film crews that brought us this unique series. I've always loved visiting Louisiana, butthis is a part of the state very few ever see. I still hate LSU, but I love this show. lol",1311984000,2011-07-30

4.0,"So I rented this movie based on the fact that guy I met while on a business trip played the lead character.  I mean, how many times do you run into that???  So, based on those credentials alone, I rented the movie.  I've got to say, not half bad.  I've developed a taste for B-movies over the years and this has got to be one of the better ones.  Certainlly low budget, and some scenes are bad enough to make your cringe but I must say I was overall pleased.  I would actually rent this one again.  I knew I was in for a treat when the prologue crossed the 5 minute mark. With a &#34;setup&#34; that long, you know your movie is going to be full of HUGE plot holes.  Well...at least they recognized that fact and tried to fill them in for you!  Overall, great low budget flick.  Hats off to you Jay Laisne!",1391731200,2014-02-07

5.0,"Caution: Spoilers ahead (although I personally believe that most of the people who read the reviews on this series are fans, not newcomers).The Shield: Season Fivewas a shocker...while Season One opened with the details of Vic Mackey killing Terry Crowley, there's an unspoken ethic in this realm of Terry being a ""rat""...yes, Vic killed a fellow cop, ""but""......the same can't be said of Shane's grenade toss and the death of Lem. It was a senseless death, uncalled for...Lem spent most of the fifth season coughing up blood and drinking Pepto Bismol over the stress caused by his decision to ""take one for the team.""But in the world of all great Shakespearean tragedies / Greek dramas, it was the necessary catalyst for Shane's ultimate fate in the final season.In Season Six, we also get Vic's Stike Team ""replacement,"" Kevin Hyatt. I think we pretty much know coming out of the gate that Hyatt is a weasel (as is more than abundantly evident from his post-one-night-strand behavior with Paula Garces' officer Tina Hanlon, but we also see it much earlier in the season). We also see the irony of Forest Whitaker's ""Kavanaugh"" meeting his final downfall for becoming Vic in order to take down Vic, and Wyms (CCH Pounder) fall to the same behavior as she lies to Vic upon Hyatt's entry in order to keep him on board in his final days, believing he has a chance at keeping his job (he doesn't). It's the same behavior, but Kavanaugh falls and Wyms rationalizes her actions. In the final season, Vic has the last laugh...sort of.In short, virtually every member of the cast makes an ill-conceived, fateful decision in this season, leading up to the Season Seven climax. A lesser show could be accused of manipulative scripting, but when it comes to The Shield...with the benefit of hindsight...these were all carefully considered, logical moves.A powerful season no matter how you look at it.",1282435200,2010-08-22

5.0,"The acting is quite good. The cinematography and sets add nicely to the underlying horror in which the actors are surrounded.The aspect that makes the WD, especially season 4 work, is not the zombies, it is the people interactions in an unreal and dangerous environment - just as Romero's NOTLD made his movie very effective.It does not get much creepier than one human (Carol) killing a female child because that child has become so corrupted by the environment that she can no longer function.In NOTLD, the creepiest part for me was when Ben was killed by the deputies and thrown on a fire with other zombie bodies. This human interaction part creeped me out and has stuck with me for years, not the zombies who were rather cute. :-)The zombies? Well, zombies are zombies and are not the main show and are actually adorable when they receive a good head splat.",1395360000,2014-03-21

3.0,"Wonderful performances all around in a very original series.  Nothing on network television is going to cover this kind of ground any time soon.

Almost like they're waving a sign in your face declaring &#34;isn't this just so weird?&#34;Yes, it is weird.  Just not overly compelling.

5.0,"I admit that I found myself caught up in the TV whirlwind that is Bones.  But with good reason a show that focuses on solving crimes via skeletal remains mixed with humor, sorta romance and danger.  It all equals a wildly addictive TV show that has you coming back for more with each episode watched.It stars David Borenaz and Emily Deschanel as partners working together.  Along Dr. Brennan and her crew of coworkers who are just as important to the show as the two stars in it.  All kinds of things take place in the 2nd season with more storylines resolved and new ones opened up.  They are just as addictive and compelling as the first season and they even have an addition to the team as a whole in a new director (Tamara Taylor) for the Jeffersonian.I love the way the season progresses with the different members of the team reaching new personal goals and other things (marriage (sorta), promotion).  It's exciting to see a show this good actually stick around for more than a minute.  I can only hope that Season 3 picks up right where this season ended on a very high note and full of possibilities this time around.  That i'm sure will have even more people flocking to check out this all around well written, directed and acted show in Bones.",1242604800,2009-05-18

The film then explains how those steps were corrupted and/or omitted, so as to reach what appears to be an erroneous conclusion.Who benefitted from the apparently false, official explanation for this tragedy?If you believe that Oswald acted alone you probably won't appreciate this film.

3.0,"I didn't know if this film would be awful or not.  Turns out it's in the horror-parody genre, most reminiscent of ""Return of the Living Dead"" (the first one, not #2 or #3) which was an amazingly enjoyable film to watch.  A couple decades later, this film has similarities in its tone and in the sheer fun it has with the zombie genre.  It definitely pays homage to scenes from a number of previous zombie films.  It has a linear plot: virus in a secret govt. research facility escapes, infecting strippers in an off-site illegal strip club, and things go from bad to worse.  However it has a decidedly comedic tone to the entire film.  It used as a source material a French play about ""The Rhinoceros"" (a gentleman's nightclub), hence all the references to French and European existentialist philosophers, writers etc.  In what other film would you get a stripper quoting Nietzche, or a spec ops guy named Camus?  It also pokes fun (repeatedly) at the George W. Bush administration-be forewarned- and it deliberately overplays stereotypes like the ""crack special forces"", the for-profit corporate contractors, the East European Madame, the greedy but inept nightclub owner,and so on.  It's not really very scary, but there's quite a bit of blood and special effects depicting violence at times.  And the ""stripper"" actresses are quite good.  They do make some beautiful stripper- dancers.  There is female nudity in the film.There are a few holes in the plot but it's all meant to be fun, so you can't take the plot all that seriously anyhow.Bonuses to the DVD include a whole bunch of trailers for other films, quite a few cut scenes (some pretty interesting), commentary filmtrack, and two fairly short clips on the making of the film.  I enjoyed the extras.  If you like zombie movies and parody, then you will like this film.",1239408000,2009-04-11

She is a detective with the police department. A few bizarre incidents and they are tangled together. She is working to save him. He is working to save her. They are both trying to keep Vincent a secret.I loved the earlier episodes in this season. Watching the pair search for answers about Vincent and trying to maintain their facade all while the romance is heating up was fun and exciting. And each of them has a best friend that I really like.I ended up giving it 4 stars because the &#34;on again&#34; then &#34;off again&#34; thing with Vincent and Cat got pretty old. If it stayed one way or the other for a while I would be okay, but I felt like I was yanked around a lot and it started feeling a little too dramatic.",1398729600,2014-04-29
4.0,"Need for Speed is the feature film adaptation of the hit video game franchise of the same name that centers around Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul), who is framed for the accidental death of his friend. Then, after two years in prison, Tobey seeks revenge on Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper), the man who caused the death of Tobey's friend.The movie isn't nearly as bad as critics are making it out to be. I'd say (because so many compare it to the Fast and Furious franchise), it's better than the first four F&F; films. Firstly, the production. Zero CGI, all practical effects and stunts. It was with Scott Waugh's direction this was possible, the man who co-directed Act of Valor. The use of real cars and stunt-work was extremely impressive, and made the film all the more impressive and entertaining. But, it was the cheesy script that made Need for Speed simply a fun, fast-paced action movie. Happily, this isn't necessarily a bad thing; the emotional moments of the movie are well-done, and the fun moments are fun. But, the acting of two of the supporting actors was not that great, at all. Even Dominic Cooper's role as the antagonist was really over-the-top, which is too bad considering how talented the man is. Happily, Aaron Paul delivers in a generic but &#34;real&#34; character, and Imogen Poots was really good as Julia Maddon, an Englishwoman who purchased a car built by Tobey and his crew. The musical score was good (I did a separate review for it on the official Soundtrack page), the cinematography was captivating, and the editing was seamless.Overall, Need for Speed is not your generic blockbuster, it's not pure &#34;popcorn&#34; entertainment, but it's not great either. If you love the video game franchise, you will love this movie; it brings some of the iconic races to life on the big screen in a great way. But also what's really nice about the film, is that it's a classic action movie. There are no gunfights, no brawls, just straight-up action-packed car sequences.",1400198400,2014-05-16

2.0,"The reason I ever liked this show was for the mystery about whether or not the main character was actually insane. I didn't need it to be answered, but I feel like this show is at its best when it spends its episodes asking that question, and investigating the mystery.

5.0,"I love this movie. After watching and rewatching on Netflix, I purchased on Amazon Instant for download to my Kindle Fire. I have to say, I was shocked to see such a low rating here on Amazon. I have become rather picky in what sci-fi movies I like, and find most of them cheesy, over hyped and without plot. Monsters is a well thought out, well executed Monster movie. Monster's is, in my opinion, 100% better than Cloverfield, which I got 3/4 of the way through and flat out turned it off never to return. Its better than Promethious and even a little better than Super 8, which I enjoyed but had issues with cheesy animation. Monsters is as much social commentary, I think, as it is a sci-fi film, its more cerebral than viseral action. Its not in-your-face thrills and horror. There is more off the screen suspense and tension is created by atmosphere, character actions/reactions and dialogue that front and center visuals. I personally prefer this type of suspense and tension, through characters, plot and setting rather than one screaming blood and guts scene after another. I find it more convincing and realistic. Don't get me wrong, there is still some blood and guts, but its not a ram rush dash from one bloody killing to another with zero plot or character development. If you are looking for a monster/alien movie that is a little more intellectual, plot/character driven, atmospheric and suspensful, you might like Monsters as much as I did.",1363392000,2013-03-16
5.0,Since the loss of Stargate universe I have been waiting for a good series with a decent plot. This does show promise and I am looking forward to the coming episodes.

5.0,....do they take so many good shows off the air and continue the ones that are only marginal? King & Maxwell was a great show. I hate that it only lasted one season but that was a great season. Well worth the watch.,1389830400,2014-01-16

5.0,"In ""Awake"", L.A. police detective Michael Britten survives a terrible car accident to live in a bifurcated world, one in which his wife survived the accident, the other in which his son survives.  Every time Michael goes to sleep, he finds himself in the other reality.  He is under psychiatric counseling in each reality.  Amusingly, his respective shrinks insist the reality is a dream.The season only lasted thirteen episodes, which was far too little to enjoy Michael working his way through cases that seemed to overlap between his realities; clues from one helped solve crimes in the other, baffling his two different partners.  Viewers would learn that Michael's accident wasn't what it seemed to be.  He was the target, or the victim, of a conspiracy whose true dimensions were unclear until nearly the end of the season.  At the end, Michael's dogged pursuit of the truth risked both death and madness.""Awake"" sustained a complicated plot; the final episodes of the season were a masterpiece of misdirection and paranoia, as Michael's two worlds began to collide.  Highly recommended.",1337904000,2012-05-25

4.0,"If you enjoy a good deal of comedy with your SciFi you will probably enjoy Eureka. There certainly are plenty of serious events, but with a regular mix of comedy to keep things from getting to dark. Kind of like the X-Files which had plenty of serious episodes but then were visited by unusual people including ""The Lone Gunmen"" to keep things in perspective. The second season is a must have for anyone that bought the first. This season continues the investigation of the alien artifact along with the further emersion of Sheriff Jack Carter and Zoe into Eureka's community.Many of the budding relationships have now fizzled and new ones have began that may seem less odd or more depending on your perspective. This is not high brow SciFi for the most part although some of the ideas are based on conceivable research. Eureka is a town of Mensa types that have their own projects and inventions that they develop. It seems they aren't under the same rules as the rest the country so anything can happen when their experiaments go wrong. Good quality DVDs and excellent replayability, but I'm still not crazy about cardboard fold up cover.",1210118400,2008-05-07

My issues with 2 came from the the far-fetched points of the movie. Liam listening to everything around him while blindfolded, then being able to tell where his location was and tell his daughter later...pretty unbelievable. Other than a few things like this, the movie had good action and tense moments. Liam delivers another strong performance, he never snoozes through a role.

This season is funny, but I think season's 1-6 are much better.....just seems like the running joke of &#34;who is Ted's wife&#34; has gone on enough.

4.0,"So, basically it's another kind of ""found footage"" ""ghosts are real"" movie. In this case, a poltergeist, I guess? Of sorts... Not exactly a ""found footage"" movie, per se, since the characters generally survive.Basic premise is that a team of investigators look into paranormal activity at a family's apartment (they moved, and the activity followed them). Weird things go bump in the night, as it were.It was pretty decent. In the end, I don't know that it really amounted to all that much. Par for the course, for the genre, I suppose. It was pretty well-done. I don't know whether all the grain in the movie was real or put in there after the fact. Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of all the grain, especially on a large 60"" LCD, via Blu-Ray. But perhaps it was a conscious choice by the the film-makers to lend a certain ephemeral authenticity, rather than shooting all on high-def, reality-perfect 'video' rather than grainy 'film.' Still, I thnk that a well-made story and gripping effects could survive the 'video' problem and still end up with something that looks splendid on Blu-Ray.If you like this flick, I also suggestGrave Encounters(don't know ifGrave Encounters 2) is as good as its forebear or not?",1359244800,2013-01-27

5.0,I have to admit I have a soft spot for this kind of show when it's done well and this one is done very well. .  So many shows of this genre start off well then fizzle out after a few episodes.

I just needed to get used to it.

I prepared myself for battle, put my boots on, dragged out my cash and away my family went.  We went up against Barry, we threw down against Dave.  We watched Jarrod and Brandy steal lockers from me (Though I have yet to figure out why there is psychology here, I have 200 bucks, I bid 200 bucks.  I bid my max and stop)  At the end of the day I was exhausted - Filming usually lasts 4 to 5 hours and there are usually many lockers to check out.  When it was all said and done I have won, in my own little way, a bit of history.  I had outbid Barry on a locker and had a lot of fun.  This is a solid show, it is a lot of fun and you can be on it if you are in the area where they are shooting.  It is a good time and what you see on the show is pretty much how it is in real life.

4.0,"When Kevin Sorbo was spotting me in the gym the other day, he wouldn't shut up about The Santa Suit, a Christmas movie he made for the Hallmark Channel some few years ago (2010). I'd just broken my collar bone recently so I figured I needed that spotter on the incline bench press, so I let dude natter on. I didn't tell him that I'd seen the movie and had thought it pretty good.While using the bow flex, he told me the plot: In The Santa Suit, Sorbo learns about compassion and charity and good will towards men. Sorbo is Drake Hunter, mercenary CEO of a toy company who, even during the season of giving, is all about the bottom line. Drake has run Hunter Toys for the past five years, since his dad passed away. And in those five years, he's habitually mistreated his staff, he's condoned horrific working conditions. He regards Santa Claus as the greatest promotional image in history. Note his impatience when his impassioned personal assistant, Marge (Rosemary Dunsmore), who's been with the toy company for thirty years, blurts out: ""Christmas is about being over the top. You sing songs you don't sing the rest of the year. You hang parasitic moss on the ceiling so you can kiss someone you love underneath it."" Oh, it was a sad day when Christmas went corporate.Sorbo talked on while he kept the heavy bag steady (several times he asked me to take it easy; I got a wicked left hook): The premise doesn't coalesce until Drake attends a quality report meeting from the R & D Dept. There, he eyeballs the prospective mall Santas and eyeballs one in particular, him what's calling himself ""Kriss Krandall"" and bemoaning the toy company's calculating methods. What are the odds that Kriss Krandall is the real deal? And that he sets out to enchant Drake Hunter? Suddenly, Drake finds that no one recognizes him, that when others look at him, they instead see the beardy face and unsvelte figure of one of them mall Santas. Drake, whose body mass index is 20, is chagrined. It takes a while for this newreality to set in for him.Thought insane by his employees, thrown out of his own demesne, mistaken for a vagrant, he makes his way to a homeless shelter where cheery social worker Nancy Baxter (Jodie Dowdall) finds him a gig as a Santa for the Dobson's Toy Store at the mall. It's there and it's when in the company of Nancy, who adores Christmas, and that one uncommunicative little girl who keeps dropping in at Dobson's (and can't quite say what she wants for Christmas) that Drake at last stumbles onto the spirit of Christmas and so sheds his cynicism. And maybe even his weird co-worker, Sebastian the Lebanese mall elf (Darrell Faria), plays a part in Drake's transformation. Faria is the movie's darkly comic presence, an over-the-top aspiring actor who sees his mall elf more as an opportunity to indulge in Dark Elf cosplay, complete with wicked tears of blood. Except in Santa's Village, bloody tears on a Santa's helper is a big nuh-uh. Drake's parting advise to Sebastian as they go to greet the children: ""Don't make them cry or scream."" Heh.I like The Santa Suit, not that I confessed this to Sorbo. It presents all the sappy ingredients of a holiday picture, but it's well done and well acted. Sorbo toes that line between restraint and trotting out his comic skills, of which we saw glimpses back when he was playing Hercules. The only issue I have with the film is in how Drake's spell is lifted because of something he does (and then tries to excuse because he owns the company). To me, that was a jarring moment. Maybe you'll see what I mean. Anyway, it's a funny movie with enough warmhearted bits and a nice holiday message, and I do recommend it. Maybe I should've said as much to Sorbo before we parted ways. But he wanted to get on the thigh abductor machine and I had to tell him not to be ridiculous. When I left him he was on the yoga mat trying out the Happy Baby Pose. Kevin Sorbo, you so crazy.",1387584000,2013-12-21

5.0,"I knew nothing about this series except that Betty White was in it (and who doesn't love Betty); I found that I could watch it free through my Kindle Fire so I went to town. This half-hour comedy is the funniest show I have seen in a long time; a laugh-out loud, pee in your pants type of laugh. You will recognize all the main characters beginning with Betty White, Wendi Mallic,  Jane Leeves (Frazier) Valerie  Berlinelli (One Day at a Time and many Lifetime and other shows).The show starts out where these three lovely ladies decide to go on  a vacation  to France. The plane unexpectedly  has to land in Cleveland (CLEVELAND????) - (THEIR THOUGHTS EXACTLY). In Cleveland compared to the other women (not true Clevelandites) these three look like movie stars and are given a great deal of attention by the attractive -he-men- of the first bar they hit. Long story short they decide to move to Cleveland where their egos are pumped up every day with every man they meet. They rent a house but Betty White-the housekeeper for fifty years can be fired or they can keep her---keep her they did and the show begins with their life in Cleveland with some mention of their life in LA  (so you learn what they did in LA) and how different Cleveland was but they loved it.There are many guest stars including Regis Philborn, David Spade, Tim Conway, and many many more very funnymen and women - Joan Rivers plays Betty's twin sister....ya' gotta' see that one!Betty is absolutely without a doubt the funniest lady we have ever had; she doesn't have to open her mouth for her body language and her facial expression(s) say it all.The story of these four begins and every single show is a gem unto itself. Do not miss this FAB  sitcom.I don't usually like l/2 hour shows but on my Kindle Fire (did I mention the first three seasons are free to Prime members) I could not put it down and, as they say, laughter is the best medicine, 'they' are so right.Don't miss this one-you'll laugh your ass off and wonder how in the hell  Betty can remember all her lines; do all that she does and still remain totally in control, funny as all get out (anybody say that anymore?) and worth the price of the dvds.I couldn't be happier that I saw this show and because the fourth season is $1.99 per show I'm going to get the DVD or wait until it comes out free on my Fire.

4.0,"""The Eclipse"" is one of those movies that sort of defies description when it comes to pegging its genre. It is not a supernatural movie in the strictest sense though there are supernatural elements throughout the movie. It also has elements of a psychological thriller. I think I'm most comfortable with viewing it as a psychological drama. The movie attracted my attention as I'm a fan of actor Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me inPersuasionas the lead character, and also in his portrayal inThe Mayor of Casterbridge. When I read that Hinds had won the Best Actor award at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival for his role in this movie, I decided to check it out.Hinds portrays a grieving widower Michael in this movie. Michael had lost his beloved wife to an illness about two years ago, and is now a single parent with two children, a girl aged 14 and a boy aged 11. Michael lives in a small coastal Irish town, working as a woodworking teacher, and generally leads a quiet and unassuming life. But recently, Michael finds himself being plagued by disturbing dreams and 'ghostly' visitations that trouble him deeply. Is he merely dreaming/hallucinating or is he really being plagued by otherworldly visitations? Things get a bit more complicated when he meets a London-based author Lena, whose supernatural-themed work titled ""The Eclipse"" captivates him and draws him to the author. Lena is one of the authors who has been invited to read at the local literary festival, and Michael is tasked with taking care of her transportation, etc.To add to all this drama, there's another author, an American, played by Aidan Quinn who is obsessed with Lena. Amidst this, Michael finds his supernatural encounters increasing with alarming frequency and tries desperately to figure out what is going on.The movie moves at a slow yet steady pace, so viewers looking for fast-paced thrills and scares will be sorely disappointed. Those who like atmospheric human dramas and psychological-themed dramas might appreciate this movie, as I did.Warning (Spoilers ahead)Upon reflection, this movie can be interpreted in different ways - a straightforward haunting of a grieving man; or of a man so lost in grief and unable to let go of his late wife and all the shared memories of their life together that he finds death 'clinging' on to him;finally, Michael is also portrayed as an aspiring writer in this movie and is frustrated by his attempts to flesh out a credible story that he feels will be up to par - I saw the supernatural aspects in this movie as Michael's subconscious trying to make sense of these stories that he is attempting to write.This is why the movie appealed to me - not only is it atmospheric with the gloomy yet breathtakingly beautiful Irish coastal landscape, the lead actor as portrayed by Ciaran Hinds embodies a complex character who draws viewers into the story and holds us captive as we try to puzzle out what exactly is going on. The soundtrack with the choir music is effectively haunting, though I must say the jarring crescendo at each 'scare' got a bit tiresome after a while. On the whole, I enjoyed this movie, and found it refreshing and unique in its approach.",1280620800,2010-08-01
5.0,This is absolutely in my top 5 favorite TV shows right now.  This is a great dramatic show with twists and turns to keep you interested.  I am always amazed at the writing and acting as it continues to keep you captivated.  I don't know who the writers are for this show but they come up with some of the best plot twists imaginable.  I gobble this up each week when it comes out and can't wait for the next episode.  Truly an addictive show.,1394150400,2014-03-07
5.0,"This documentary does a good job of pointing out just how important where you are born and to whom you are born can be. Wealth and privilege more often than not trumps intelligence, hard work, and determination.

5.0,"I wasn't expecting much from this show.  While I love the movies based on comics, the TV shows haven't done so well.  This one excels because of the character development.  Who knew?  Character development in a comic?!?  Arrow is a conflicted human being who is trying very hard to work out his issues.  He doesn't always get it right and he pays a high price from time to time.  A hero who fails, see what I mean about character development?  The supporting characters are well rounded also and over time the viewer begins to feel that they know and either like or dislike these people.  The action is also good and the plot lines are interesting.  Although it is a show with violence in it; it does not contain the horrible graphic violence a lot of shows today do.  I'd recommend it.",1359849600,2013-02-03

Seems like you could have a beer and a laugh with them but the episodes repeat themselves and are a bit corny at times. Mostly about light drama and ribbing each other. I think every episode has brushed on family dinners at the table. It's just not that appealing really. My wife likes it more than me.,1398902400,2014-05-01
5.0,I wasn't sure if I would like this since it was a football show but figured for one episode I would try it. I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed the show.

5.0,"Five stars for the awesomeness of the Mike Weston character in this episode and for the discernible improvement of the show with the addition of Connie Nielsen.  I wasn't sure if the second season was going to be any good after I got tired of the cult followers getting stabby stabby in EVERY episode in the first season but I find the second season more likable and easier to watch.  In hindsight, this show has a secondary story about Mike Weston's growing awareness of the criminals and what is needed to take them down in contrast to Ryan Hardy's probably duplicitous weaknesses and prejudices such as shutting down Mike Weston's assessment of Joe Caroll's piquerism in the pilot episode.",1394064000,2014-03-06

3.0,"Yet another police procedural right out of the basic TV Writers Guide to Cop Shows. From the same source as Chicago Fire, it follows the same template.  However, that is a miracle of realism compared to this show.  Here we have an intelligence unit (maybe THE intelligence unit, even big departments don't usually have more than one) which seems to perform few of the functions of an intelligence unit.  The unit also seems darn small for a major department and is apparently populated mostly by former calendar models.  Then there is the usual hard-bitten, street smart, brutal when required sergeant who performs few of the functions of a sergeant.  We also have the now standard TV organization of mostly white people with a black guy in charge.  Now, it would not make for exciting TV to watch these guys trolling through databases and writing reports for 51 minutes.  But a little credibility wouldn't hurt a bit.",1390003200,2014-01-18
3.0,"The first season was quite good, but the second season is a downward spiral which just rehashes much of the material from the 1st season. Honestly, I didn't quite make it all the way the 2nd season (two shows short). Too many of the same people, too much of the same low budget graphics, too little new material. Frankly I'm surprised that this show could possibly survive beyond a third season; yet, surprisingly it's made it all the way to season 5. The personalities interviewed are bubbling over with personality, but the logic of their arguments often lacks... Logic. An O.k. show for one or two episodes, but I totally lost interest after season two.",1372550400,2013-06-30

2.0,"Odd mixture of Glee and slasher film has a few laughs, some decent gore and a lot of musical numbers.  Stage Fright has a fantastic trailer but the movie itself isn't nearly as good.  The problem is that Stage Fright wants to be a horror comedy but it isn't funny enough consistently to work as a comedy and there are too few suspense scenes for it to work as a horror film--the horror elements are pretty much concentrated at the beginning and end of the film and mostly ignored in the middle.  That leaves the singing and dancing.  The songs aren't bad and a couple of the musical sequences are even fairly clever, but the various elements Stage Fright is trying to juggle never really end up meshing all that well.  This might be worth a look if the idea of a slasher comedy with musical numbers appeals to you, but in the end Stage Fright is an ambitious failure.",1396915200,2014-04-08

4.0,"Those who grew up watching Johnny Carson will enjoy this the most. Its been 20 years since he was last on the air, and it brought back a lot of memories for me from the 80's and early 90's when I was growing up and my parents watched The Tonight Show nearly every night.Johnny was obviously not a perfect person, but his style of entertainment was so successful, most of us that watched him perform live will always be able to reminisce and realize that somehow the show became an important part of our lives, even if we didn't know it at the time. No matter how bad your day was, you knew you were going to come home, turn on the tv, and laugh. My parents have since passed away, but even something as simple as The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson was a large part of my life growing up, and I found watching this was both sad because its been so long since he was on the air and people like my parents were still around, and it also made me smile because I have so many memories from watching the show many evenings.People like Jay Leno and David Letterman have been extremely successful with their own shows and styles, but nothing will ever replace Johnny, and I feel bad that those who were born after he went off the air will never really know him or The Tonight Show. Overall this American Masters episode did a good job of giving us a small look into the imperfect life of someone that was part of many of our lives for years, and it brings back the memories once again.",1340496000,2012-06-24

Some say it seemed a little rushed but I actually think it may have been a bit too much to have an entire 22 or 23 episode season of breaking out of a prison in Panama that only has guards on the outside. They do a great job once again of keeping you on the edge of your seat with this one.A lot more is revealed about ""The Company"" and the massive conspiracy, and of course, Burrows and Scofield find themselves neck deep in it.

5.0,"The season 2 finale and season 3 opener featuring the zombie master were, in my opinion, a little disappointing if not downright campy however episode two of the current season sets the stage for a decidedly different turn of events.  What fans are being treated to is nothing short of an expanding universe as other legendary creatures, not necessarily Wesen, are introduced along with hints of Nick's deadlier powers and darker persona.  Everyone's favorite Blutbad (i.e. Monroe) continues to be an active consultant helping to lighten the mood but with a decidedly larger emphasis on his own story while the European intrigue sub-plot continues to become a more substantial and thankfully more interesting part of the overall series.Horror lovers will be pleased with the look and feel that Grimm continues to cultivate and given that it precedes ""Dracula"" on Friday evening is helping to give NBC a reputation as the place to go for legitimate, creepy thrills.  If you can't wait till season 3 is released on DVD but don't care for the commercials associated with television, then buy a season pass (includes a slight discount) on Amazon and you can watch new episodes that premiere Friday evening on Saturday morning.  :o)",1386979200,2013-12-14

3.0,"Here's what you get: the greatest of actors trying to bring to life a mediocre story.  There a few thrilling scenes that you will like.  But the heist plan is lackluster, unnecessarily complicated, with a poetic justice twist in the end that just did not feel that satisfying.The professional criminals make a few stupid mistakes that you probably will not be able to forgive.  Designed to characterize, these mistakes just make them look unprofessional, unpredictable, and kind of silly.  I won't spoil anything, but you'll see a couple when the counterfeiter works on a painting, the wheel man jumps a motorcycle, and the apprentice crosses a border.  Just a few examples.The movie cannot decide if it is a comedy or a heist movie.  The Interpol agent is not funny, but constantly tries to be,  It makes you feel NO TENSION WHATSOEVER that our criminals will be caught.  Jay Baruchel's character delivers some believable comedy--even at the border crossing, but on top of the fumbling Interpol agent, it is just too much.The writers seem to have forgotten that the best stories pit CAPABLE and threatening enemies against heroes.  They wasted a cast of acting giants to put on a semi-entertaining Bugs Bunny cartoon.There is a nagging question of trust plaguing the movie throughout, which starts as a point of tension but deteriorates into a eye-rolling, annoying situation that should be remedied with a gun.This movie MIGHT keep you attention all the way through, because you will want to see the ending once you get invested.  But it is worthy of a 3 ONLY because of the stellar performances within such an unfinished, unpolished, and sometimes stupid story.  The actors are naturals.  The story is forced.",1399680000,2014-05-10

5.0,"Having a conversation about Bryan Fuller's exquisite television adaptation of HANNIBAL, it became clear that this was one of the only occasions we could think of where two separate performers had taken the same character and created iconic performances of that character. Anthony Hopkins has the scenery-chewing in the films, and Mads Mikkelsen has his restrained, thoughful work on this show. And while the first season was gorgeous in its gore, amazing in its talent, superb in its writing, there was a restraint there because who could have thought that a show this mature and disturbing and intelligent would get a second season? Once they did, though, they must have thought there wouldn't be a third season, because they went for broke in this season, and it's breathtaking.The season opens with its most bravura mission statement yet: A fight, possibly to the death, between Lecter and Jack Crawford (still amazingly portrayed by Laurence Fishburne), signifying that Jack finally believes Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) that Hannibal is indeed The Chesapeake Ripper and not Will. Then, at a climactic moment of that fight, the show cuts to several weeks prior to that, beginning a countdown that has viewers on the edges of their seats until that moment actually happens. It's a startling way to begin the season, but it gives the entire show for the rest of the season a sense of urgency for the audience as we asked ourselves, ""When is this going to happen?"" But so many interesting, provocative and terrible things are happening in the interim as this climax builds that soon we find ourselves forgetting about what's to come, and give ourselves over completely to what's happening in the moment.If for some reason, any viewer thinks this idea seems like it wouldn't or shouldn't work, you'd be dead wrong.This season takes the ideas that were already turned on their heads from Fuller's adaptation of Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"" and turns them even further, which, like the wildly popular THE WALKING DEAD, works to the show's benefit because it leaves all sorts of room to deviate from the book. The main themes of this season are becoming and design. There has always been a duality between Will and Hannibal since the very first episode, but this season takes the duality even further into what the characters are becoming, usually by the design of Hannibal and to a much lesser extent by Will. As Will pushes Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas) farther away, he pushes her right into the arms of Hannibal. This is Hannibal's design. Freddie Lounds (Lara Jean Chorostecki) is becoming more and more of an interloper, and may have to be dealt with. This is Will's design. Dr. Chilton (Raul Esparza) is finding himself more and more prideful of his dealings with Will and then with Hannibal. This is Hannibal's design. Newcomer characters of the brother/sister team of Mason and Margot Verger (Michael Pitt and Katherine Isabelle, respectively) both have designs of their own, but are ultimately part of Hannibal's design. The fate of Miriam Lass (Anna Chlumsky) is revealed and is VERY much of Hannibal's design. Hannibal's psychiatrist Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson) is trying to help Will. All of these characters are becoming something, even Jack and his wife Bella (Fishburne's real-life bride Gina Torres) are becoming products of Hannibal's design. Every time you think that Will might finally have the upper hand, Hannibal is always several steps ahead. And when we finally do get to the finale, every moment of shock is piled on top of another until you realize that you probably haven't breathed for several minutes.Under the very imaginative eye of Fuller, and with directors like Peter Medak, Tim Hunter, Guillermo Navarro and David Slade, this is easily the most visually arresting show on television. The composition, the lighting, the depth of focus; all of the intangibles that go into making a television show are all acting in perfect concert. The murders are more grand and more beautiful (which honestly, they really are, if you ignore how horrific they are). The scale of the show has grown, but the majority of all the scenes are either at FBI headquarters, Hannibal's home or office, Will's home and the Psychiatric Hospital, giving the show a very intimate quality.However good the performances by the supporting cast might be, and they're all pretty damn stunning, the show lives and dies with Mikkelsen and Dancy, who have become so adept at their verbal chess game and seem so comfortable with each other that their relationship seems totally organic, which is something most shows aren't capable of doing. For me, the real tragedy in their relationship is that Hannibal really does care about Will. He wants Will to choose to be his friend. There's an innate sadness within Hannibal that Mikkelsen is able to flesh out and for the first time in this character's history, he's not just likable; he's sympathetic, and that's a huge testament to their relationship in the show.This show really is a niche show, but it has been growing steadily in popularity because of how amazing the show is, signifying yet again that with shows like HANNIBAL, BREAKING BAD, TRUE DETECTIVE, THE AMERICANS, GAME OF THRONES, LOUIE, JUSTIFIED, SHERLOCK, MASTERS OF SEX, HOMELAND and ORPHAN BLACK, we are living once again in a new television renaissance. And HANNIBAL is easily near the top of the best shows currently of this age.",1405468800,2014-07-16

4.0,"It's such a refreshing thing to find a kids' show that is intelligent enough to be enjoyed by adults. But I started seeing some resemblance to Harry Potter-the girl in this show seems to be smarter than she should be at her age, like Hermione; the other boy is the slightly dumb Ron Weasley; and Gortimer is the hero.  Nothing wrong with this, but a little disappointing that the creators weren't a little more creative.  (and being a nitpicker I have to mention that on &#34;the hottest day of the year for the third day&#34;, Gortimer's mom is wearing a long-sleeved shirt, and afterwards, when the temperature is supposed to have gotten back to normal, she's wearing a sleeveless shirt.)  I'll watch more episodes if they make more.",1392422400,2014-02-15
4.0,"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a  movie format, it is good to look at each part as one part can ruin an entire episode.The movie: Even though this movie is from the 90's, it basically ignores all movie advancements since the 50's (like character development, plot, camera angles, lighting, etc.).  Yes this is the man-turns-into-monster plot (or in this case about five men who turn into five different monsters) that was already over used by 1956.  I at first thought they colorized ""Mad Monster"" until I realized that the actors in ""Mad Monster"" didn't have such strange accents.  So yes the movie is bad although the accents and the nonsensical soundtrack are funny enough to make it slightly watchable.Segments: The last two with Mike and Crow were hilarious.  I did like the how Pearl presented the movie with a one word introduction - about the same effort that the producers used to make it.Riffs: No outstanding stingers but a good job by Mike and the bots from start to end.  They of course have fun pointing out that the monster and one of the character's hair are different in every scene.Overall:  Not a classic but a very good episode.",1316995200,2011-09-26

5.0,"I'd heard about this child's near death experience but didn't know much about it.  When the film came to town I decided to give it a try even though I've found most Christian films to be poorly made.  I didn't expect a lot.  However the fact that it starred Greg Kinnear was promising.  It was much better than I expected.  Kinnear was, indeed, magnificent as the  small town Nebraska preacher whose son had a &#34;lrip to Heaven.'  I didn't read the book but from what others have written here, apparently the book says that the boy did acually &#34;die&#34; while the film insists that he didn't.  I don't know what difference that actually makes.  In any case the child believed that he went to Heaven, saw angels, Jesus and some of his relatives.Much of the film is focused on the dilemma of the father, for whom this is a problem.  He is challenged by members of his community and even his church, who don't believe the child's story and feel that perhaps the pastor should move on.The film is well cast.  Kinnear is wonderful, the child who plays the boy is beyond adorable.  The members of the congregation add another dimension to the story.I credit the writer and director for bringing this story to the public in a time when Christianity is not popular in the mainstream media.  It is very well done, isn't really preachy and should appeal to any person who is open minded enough to admit that there might be things beyond normal belief.",1401062400,2014-05-26

3.0,Watched on the strength of its creator who was responsible for The Gilmore Girls which I thought was exceptional.  The same witty comments are heard but not delivered with same brilliance as the cast from The Gilmore Girls.  The initial premise was thin (a showgirl in Las Vegas is wooed into marrying a mundane man who actually still lives with his mother - Kelly Bishop who was Lauren Graham' s mother in The Gilmore Girls).  The showgirl inherits her husband's property when he dies only two days following the wedding.  She also inherits the studio where the mother teaches dance to a group of teenagers (the bun heads).  It is interesting enough to keep watching (seen only a few episodes so far) but hope for improvement from the cast overall.,1371945600,2013-06-23
5.0,"This is an excellent documentary about Detroit's economic collapse, crime, and heroism.  The camera follows a Detroit fire house for an entire year, going on a mad gushing stream of runs.  The city is shutting down (literally in places), and 90% of the fires are arson.  The firefighters thrive on the fight, but they also give up an awful lot for paltry recompense -- indeed the film says, most hold a second job too.  The local economy, fire service management, and personal struggles make a very human backdrop for the blazes and heroics.Five stars all the way.  I had seen a trailer for this during the Tribeca Film Festival in 2012, but couldn't get tickets.  I was waiting for the full.  Worth the wait.",1378252800,2013-09-04
5.0,The show is a great comedy but I am very happy to see it come to a close. I think the writers should have wrapped it up in season 8. It really could have been great ending a year earlier with Ted meeting the mother much sooner. I think the long stretch irritated the viewers. The show is well worth watching to laugh but the material ended about a year ago.,1392163200,2014-02-12

3.0,"This is a prequel to the Burn Notice series. It is designed to tell the story of how Bruce Campbell's character Sam Axe ended up in Miami. It is essentially an hour and a half long episode, which aside from a 5 min cameo from Jeffrey Donovan, involves his character exclusively. It definitely misses things like the character interaction, quick wit and even the voice overs you get in the series. It just makes it feel a little off.The story centers around Sam having to train a ragtag band of farmers in Columbia who are mistakenly branded a terrorist organization to survive an attack by a corrupt paramilitary organization who want their land. There are also the requisite North American aid workers who get involved in the story, and toward the end a couple bumbling CIA officers who show up in Season 7 of the TV show. The story kind of skirts the line between serious and campy, and does have some tie ins to the show (like the origin of Sam's alias Chuck Finley).While Campbell did a fine acting job and plays his character well, I just think it lacked what makes the TV show so great. I know there are some people who really dislike this, and if you were expecting it to be more like the TV show as opposed to a stand alone movie, I can understand that sentiment. It is certainly not something that you have to see in order to understand anything in the series. Aside from knowing who the CIA agents are when they show up in the 7th season of the TV show, there is nothing else from this that has been tied in.As far as extras, there is audio commentary, some deleted scenes and a feature on Jeffrey Donovan directing. Overall I think it is OK. Certainly not great, but for a $10 blu ray disc, it was worth the price.",1374883200,2013-07-27

3.0,"The movie starts out with a movie projectionist reading about the lost colony of Roanoke. Then the power goes off. When he investigates he finds empty clothes where people should be. There are eerie shadows and he too disappears. Hayden Christensen wakes up and finds the city in a similar state, with clothes, but missing bodies. 3 days later (apparently he was unable to walk out of the city in that time, Christensen is walking around the city in the dark scrounging batteries for flashlights (HEY! TRY THE STORES!) and discovering the city has been hit by a discriminating EMF that effects car batteries but not dry cells. He is not yet ready to embrace the dark side of the force.In the midst of it all he finds a bar with the lights still on (own generator) and decides he needs a bracer. People start to congregate at the bar one at a time. Outside, when your light goes out, computer generated blackness quickly swarms around you to eerie music. Sunlight becomes a thing of the past as Detroit becomes Dark City. Apparently these are not the people who know how to set the city on fire every Halloween.The characters discuss tons of reasons why this is happening and the best one was that God/ the universe hit the ""reset"" button and they are the stragglers.",1306022400,2011-05-22

5.0,"It is a well-done TV series that can absorb cast changes and continue to deliver excellent shows.  NCIS Season Two ended with the shocking murder of Agent Caitlin Todd.  Season Three opens with two major cast additions.  Cote de Pablo joins the team as the beautiful and dangerous Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David, while veteran actress Lauren Holly, as Jenny Shepard, becomes the new director of NCIS.The changes put iconic Senior Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) in the awkward situation of working in a new agent while getting used to a new boss who is a former love interest.  The rest of the team, still grieving for Caitlin, are slow to embrace Ziva but will be won over by her obvious competence, and by her hilarious efforts to master American slang.  Wisecracking Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)in particular will find that Ziva forces him to raise his game in a way that Caitlin never quite did.The exciting two-part season opener resolves the still-open case of Agent Todd's murder.  A two-part season ender places Gibbs' service with NCIS at risk.  The audience will learn more about Gibbs' past while contemplating another season-ending cliff-hanger.  In between, the team will handle serial killers, terrorists, and kidnappings with its usual mixture of brisk police procedural and entertaining repartee.  Six special features about the making of the show are included in the DVD set.  ""NCIS: The Third Season"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1249084800,2009-08-01

3.0,"TERMINATOR SALVATION: THE MACHINIMA SERIES was first launched as a web series comprised of six episodes, and chances are that if you've spent $1.99 per episode on iTunes, XBox Live, or wherever, then you may've thrown away some good green. For those in the dark (which was me, not too long ago), machinima, a term combining the words ""machine"" & ""cinema,"" is a cost-effective but still developing medium which utilizes video-game engines and characters to narrate its stories. In TERMINATOR SALVATION: THE MACHINIMA SERIES, the visuals are generated from the game engine of the Terminator Salvation video game. Regarding the quality of the graphics, the key words here are probably ""a still developing medium.""The super-sexy Moon Bloodgood lends her vocals to again play Resistance fighter Blair Williams, who in the live action film was either woefully underused or a mere afterthought. Here, she's fleshed out a bit and she takes on the kickasss action heroine role so prevalent in the Terminator franchise. Blair Williams is someone who remembers what life was like before Judgment Day, yet is still young and vibrant enough to adapt to her lethal post-apocalyptic environment and learn how to fight. In six episodes, we see her grit and resourcefulness and just how full of fight she is. I'm not clear on the exact timeline of this story. I've heard of this being touted as a prequel to TERMINATOR SALVATION, but I've also heard that this is actually set after TERMINATOR SALVATION but before the video game. Whatever the case, the story takes place in a ravaged Los Angeles sometime in 2016, with Blair Williams tasked with ferreting out the Ghost, an elusive entity which had been disrupting the Resistance's communication system.Die-hard fans may want to get this DVD to complete their collection, but others can probably make do without. Although there are tons of frantic chases and firefights with the Machines, the story itself isn't really that compelling and I don't think it at all enriches the Terminator mythos. But it's made even less relevant by the faulty animation. Not too surprisingly the look of the thing did make me feel as if I were in the middle of a video game. Thing is, the graphics don't really achieve, let alone maintain, a high level of quality. You know it's rough when the animators don't even try real hard to sync the lip movements of the characters with their dialogue.Bonus stuff on the DVD offers the Making Of TERMINATOR SALVATION: THE MACHINIMA SERIES featurette (which is an extensive breaking down of the machinima technology) and a Character Profile on Blair Williams which includes interviews with Moon Bloodgood who, I'll say it again, is super-sexy. 2.5 stars out of 5 for this one.",1260489600,2009-12-11

3.0,"Today marks the first day I've ever seen this show.  This is just an off-the-top-of-my-head review.The first scenario involved a husband who said his wife accidentally shot herself.  However, the forensics prove that she could not have done so.  The husband was a lawyer and he was having an affair with a judge.  That reminded me of the female astronaut who drove for eight hours wearing adult diapers.  The point is: people in prestigious professions sometimes do stupid things for love/lust just like the way a Jerry Springer guest would.I watch ""Forensic Files"" religiously.  I immediately began comparing/contrasting the two shows.  This show is twice as long, so I figured they must go into depth more.  However, they have two scenarios in many episodes.  So it's just like watching two consecutive episodes of ""Forensic Files"" which is ofte how it's aired on TruTV anyway.  In fact, the second scenario here was reported on ""Forensic Files.""  I could tell because they showed the white murder victim wearing traditional Japanese garb.  This makes me wonder if there aren't that many forensics-saved-the-case fact patterns in the world.  However, that may be a good thing if that means the murder rate is getting lower in this country.  This scenario showed a theme often relayed on ""Forencic Files"": single women who leave their doors open or are just moving in and violating men take advantage of them.  Single women: please lock your doors and windows as much as possible!  I think Polynesian guys are hot and they had a Polynesian interviewee here.  I also looooove butt chin and one interviewee has a butt chin so deep, he could compare to Kirk Douglas or Andy Dyck.This show is quite similar to ""Forensic Files"" and sometimes there's not too much of a good thing.",1320192000,2011-11-02

It's one of those shows where while you watch it you forget about your problems because it's one of those sitcoms that is easygoing, funny and you just have a good time watching it. The cast works so great together, and the show is funnier than ever, they were some episodes where I was laughing like crazy. But there's also some seriousness: There's love for both girls (FINALLY MAX!) while we still see them go through life while they're still ""broke"". I also love that this show falls into being bizarre but it stays so true to reality at the same time. Kat Dennings still steals the show with Max's one-liners, but Beth as Caroline is awesome too!I can see myself in the future watching the episodes of this show over and over again without getting tired of them. That's how good the show is to me. The jokes are never ""tired"", and if you love the humor of the previous seasons you will love the show even more, it's even better!

4.0,"For those that have missed it, this is a re-inventing of Sherlock Holmes.  I don't agree with all the creative choices that have been made, a father that is never seen but apparently has unlimited depth of pockets ($$) seems... I don't know, easy.Some of the plots push the limits of credibility, but still and all and considering the competition that is out there it's a pretty decent show.  The actors play their parts and the plots don't necessarily take the easy way out.  Watson could be the constant &#34;Oh Sherlock, you can never do this or that&#34;, but they avoid that and provide Lucy Lui with intelligent input into the whole detective process.  Sherlock himself, major flaws, definitely a different take where his mind shows a childish side a lot of times (periods of frustration), that grow on you.Season 2, they introduced Mycroft, and I love the actor who plays that part.  I disagree with the way he was handled  (Michellin star restauranteur instead of a deductionist himself), which to my mind precludes him being an active player in more than a couple episodes.Still that episode in particular, and towards the end, there's one scene that had me laughingIgnore the bits of weakness, let it grow, it's good now and I think it has potential going forward to be something really good.Assuming of course they can still come up with imaginative ways of killing folk off.",1381190400,2013-10-08

5.0,"Amazon Unbox rocks!! Do not listen to a bunch of mad mac fans. Mac sucks and that is why nothing supports it. The Unbox service is easy to use, easy to download, and you get your episodes a day after they air! I am very happy with it. If a mac user is waiting for it to go to iTunes, forget it! Mac messed up again and thought their service was going to be the only one on the block. Now I can buy .mp3 songs (unprotected) and video files with being stuck with crapmac software. By the way if you buy a song on itunes it is in .mp4 format and can ONLY be used with crapmac software. So who is Propriety? Unbox 5 stars itunes 0 stars period!",1208995200,2008-04-24

5.0,"Each episode is a unique twist of an iconic murder case. The characters are so fully formed you care for them as you would family. But the lead, Rupert Penry-Smith is so fascinating you can't look away. One either wants to adopt him or bed him, the emotional attachment is so strong. That too is the writer's idea of what a modern man should be, full of strange weakness, compulsive behavior but with an endearing gentle heart. When will you include the 4th series?",1386720000,2013-12-11

5.0,"While everyone would love to be a Neal Caffery, few humans could ever have one let alone all of his skill sets, thus the magic of film/video.  Neal exemplifies and allows us to relate with the  criminal mind in all of us tempered by moral standards keeping him one of the good guys.  The characters are easily liked and endear us quickly.  So much so that you feel like you know them, can anticipate their moves and thoughts, and relate to their concerns.  Once again hats off to the cast and creative writing.  This series is a lot of fun and worthy of a few more seasons.  I am anxious to see where it takes us next.",1391040000,2014-01-30

5.0,"After years of what felt like a collection of stale broadcast TV sitcoms, I was introduced to How I Met Your Mother. While I've never been a big fan of any particular sitcom, this show got me excited about the genre for the first time ever. I was introduced to it by my sister, who brought a borrowed copy of the third season on DVD home with her from college. I ended up watching a few episodes and was very pleasantly surprised by How I Met Your Mother -- it was absolutely hilarious. While I always thought that sitcoms were just full of overly used jokes and cardboard characters, How I Met Your Mother was not only funny and fresh, but felt like it had more depth than the typical sitcom. I was hooked.How I Met Your Mother has a unique storytelling style that continues into season four. The overarching story is being told by an older Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) to his children. The series consists of a series of flashbacks from Ted's 20s and 30s about the lives of himself and his friends living in New York City and, ultimately, how he met his future wife. This frame may seem complex, especially if you haven't tuned in from the beginning, but it's done in a breezy, comfortable manner that feels natural and doesn't confuse viewers. I felt like it was a story that my father could have been telling me because sometimes there are flashbacks within the overarching flashback and scenes and timing are not perfectly linear, which is more like how a person would share memories -- as they are triggered by something else, rather than chronologically.In season four, the gang continues to mature as they enter their 30s. Ted successfully proposes to Stella (Sarah Chalke), but is left at the altar. Ted fights to come to terms with it, and later reenters the dating scene after becoming roommates with ex-girlfriend Robin (Cobie Smulders). Ted is later laid off from his job, and he decides to begin his own architecture firm. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) struggles with growing feelings for Robin. While Barney continues his usual womanizing ways, tension grows between him and Robin as Barney's feelings start to come out. Meanwhile, Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) move into their new apartment and struggle with whether or not they're ready to have children. Each character's world changes throughout the series, building up for more antics in season five.The cast of How I Met Your Mother does a perfect job of playing off one another, making the jokes and punch lines feel snappy and well-utilized. While many comedies run the risk of overdoing jokes, How I Met Your Mother does a fantastic job of balancing the joke surrounding an episode with all of the characters. By far, the best (and most hilarious) character in this show is the awe-(wait for it...)-some Barney Stinson with his unnamed corporate job, endless supply of suits, and constant bedding of various women. Barney is always up to something off-the-wall and funny, no matter what's happening in the lives of the other characters.The season four DVD set includes all 24 episode on three discs in widescreen format with English 5.1 Dolby Surround sound plus English, French, and Spanish subtitles -- not to mention a great selection of bonus features. These features include a recap of season three, episode commentaries, a gag reel, ""A Night with Your Mother"" special featuring an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences panel discussion, a hilarious gag video about how awesome Barney is, and an extended scene from ""The Fight.""Season four is another great chapter in the How I Met Your Mother saga. The series is just as humorous as when it first began, and the characters continue to be interesting and funny. The amazing thing for me about this series is how it can cover such a range of emotions in just one episode. I don't usually respond to TV or movies emotionally, but How I Met Your Mother can make me roll around laughing and takes me to the brink of tears in the same episode. I can't wait for the new season to start.",1253491200,2009-09-21
1.0,"One of the few good things on this show was actor Stephen Dorf.  Although this show had plenty of flaws, I kept watching primarily for him.  However, this was his last episode on the show and with that, I had completely had it with this reincarnation of one of my favorite shows, the original LAW AND ORDER set in NYC.  The problems with this show are manifold.  The worst is that it is trying to be a hybrid of the original show with a CSI show.  So instead of the excellence of a team which had Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston in the gritty New York scene, there is this technicolor mess of a show trying to infuse us with the coolness of the hopped up LA scene.  All this is missing is the Horatio from CSI Miami with his sunglasses to cement it as a truly unbelievable show.  The CRIMINAL INTENT version of this show was also ruined by constantly reinventing a concept which worked.  It too became unwatchable with Jeff Goldblum at the helm.  My recommendation is to skip this show and stick to the reruns of the original, especially the ones with Waterston and Orbach in their primes.",1302825600,2011-04-15
5.0,"While the series is very loosely based on the events of the life of Henry VIII the performances by JR Meyers, Sam Neill as Wolsey, and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More really make the piece.Natalie Dormer is pitch perfect as Anne, even if we can see through her and her family and find her annoying! Maria Doyle Kennedy as the Queen is superb. She is warm, human, dignified and we actually feel sorry for all the king is throwing away for a woman who ultimately proved to not be worth it. And how much he will destroy in England in the process.Henry as a 'sleeping lion' is wonderfully portrayed. The series starts and ends looking like a 'bonkbuster' but there is a LOT of interesting stuff that will pique your interest in the real history if you can get past the nudie bits.Squishing his 2 sisters into the one who marries his friend Charles Brandon was silly and pointless, and it is amazing they never once mention Scotland in the whole 10 hours! Margaret Tudor married the king of scotland, Mary the old senior King of France, not Portugal, and he died 3 months later.The Thomas Tallis parts were just silly, and partly for shock value and more sex, but I think they were trying to show a bit about the 'common man'.The scenes between Henry and Anne light up the screen--it is interesting to see the contrast with the second series, when they are barely in the same county, let alone room. (GREAT acting in both).The costumes, settings and acting make this, while not perfect, certainly an excellent way to savor history and the period.",1239408000,2009-04-11

5.0,"I watched this twice, to make sure I really got it and to test my perceptions of it.  The first time, I watched it in big blocks of three hours over consecutive days and got very tired of it, kind of waiting to get to Caesar's assassination for it to end.  The second time, I watched each episode separated by a few days, and it was much much better that way.  Like all good films, I saw much more and am sure that it will get even better with subtleties and nuance on repeated viewings.The plot follows Caesar as he ends the Gallic War, crosses the Rubicon as a revolutionary (or demagogue or psychopath or whatever), and becomes dictator, ending with his murder.  However, rather than a single character, such as Claudius in I Claudius, the story omnisciently follows several lives of those revolving around Caesar.  You have aristocrats (supporters and opponents), soldiers, and the normal riff-raff of Rome.  In many ways, the main character really is Rome itself, as Caesar is at best a shadowy figure, while the others appear and reappear suddenly.The principal characters are the honorable Centurion Vorenus and his troublesome sidekick, the brutal legionnaire  Pullo.  They are entirely fictional, and while the actors that portray them are very good, they came off as a bit of a plot device, to get the viewer into certain places and to illustrate things that were occurring.  They pop up in Caesar's last major Gallic battle, scramble for work in ROme, join Caesar's civil war effort in Greece and Egypt, then return to seek new careers in Rome.  They stumble across Pompey, Cleopatra, and Octavian (the future Augustus), all the while rather oblivious to the true meaning of events unfolding around them, even though Vorenus becomes a Senator.  That being said, the intrigues that weave their way through the story are quite fun, and while embellished as all historical fiction must be, accurate in the outline of events as we know them.  You also have the aristocrats (actual historical figures, though with added fictional details) of Atia and Servilia; they are mortal enemies, both connected to Caesar and intriguers that are as cold as they come.I did not need to watch this to learn the history, though it would definitely be good for that.  For me, the greatest pleasure is the painstaking accuracy of the portrayal of Rome and life at that time.  The viewer is served a host of wonderful images, vivid colors, and very well drawn characters.  You can not only smell Rome, but feel the chaos and fear that convulsed the city at this time.  Then there is the manner in which people lived, evocations of their non-Christian religious beliefs and rituals, the conditions in which slaves lived, and the character of the Roman aristocrat, who would resignedly accept death for the sake of honor or as the price for risking political gain.  It is truly wonderful, and the bonus disk has excellent mini-documentaries that explain much of it.  (I did find inaccuracies, such as the claim that ""anything goes"" sexually - the Romans were notorious homophobes, for example - but these were very few.)Warmly recommended.  While the story and drama are not as tight as in I Claudius, it is an absolutely first-rate evocation of a vanished world.",1232928000,2009-01-26

5.0,"A very solid offering from a slightly freer Russia than the Russia I grew up with twenty years ago and before.  This is the story of a young woman who seeks to improve herself with a cheap gimmick that causes all kinds of problems.  Suddenly the government and the police are after her, and suddenly she can do things that she wasn't aware she could do.Part Matrix, part Brainstorm, but all Russian, this very innovative animated film has a very sleek look and finish to it.  Production design, character design, action sequences, and even the dialogue are all top notch, and what's even more is that even though it is a Russian product we don't get the usual dour dismal fatalistic and pessimistic outlook on life that permeates classic Russian literature, film and story telling.  This is a vibrant, gritty, and dynamic production with, dare I say it, an optimistic outlook for the characters and story.A total turnaround from previous films I've seen from what used to be the Soviet Union.  If you're an avid sci-fi fan, then do yourself a favor and give this film a chance.  You won't be sorry.Enjoy.",1372550400,2013-06-30

5.0,"How our ancestors suffered, even a bare hundred years ago, whether they were the patients or the staff of the biggest charity hospital for the poor in turn of the century London. Medicine was advancing in 1906, just not fast enough to stem the tide of suffering brought on by injury and disease aided and abetted by poverty. Asepsis (sterile and clean conditions) had been discovered and developed as had chloroform and ether as surgical anesthetics, primitive (and dangerous) x-ray technology, but antibiotics, intravenous solutions, imaging technology that didn't kill the patient on its own and a simple sugar and water solution to keep people from dying from dehydration were decades in the future, along with many, many other things.The body had been well anatomized and diseases were documented and described. The problem was the paucity of treatments that worked. The brave men and women who tried to turn the tide are everyday heroes and should remind us of the nurses who still take care of us.People suffered from birth defects, malnutrition, infectious diseases, diseases of aging and poverty, industrial accidents and gang warfare all of it grimed in a coat of dirt and vermin that the nurses struggled to stem. Every, every, everything was dirty at a time when cleaning required ten times the work it does today. Nurses were also expected to be married to the hospital, not allowed to marry or see a man romantically and this went on to the forties.The stories in London Hospital are all taken from life be it newspaper articles, hospital records or personal memoirs. The producers have also gone to some trouble to make the procedures and illnesses real in a stomach churning, toe curling manner. Other reviewers have criticized this as an attempt to shock. I agree it is shocking, but it is necessary to have even a prayer of taking the viewer back to the genuine suffering of this era. Drama with the staff is interspersed with the cases but London Hospital is a piece of medical history that is profound in its depiction and its implications. Very highly recommended but not for the faint of heart. Many of the medical scenes are truly grisly and watching the dead die all over again is affecting. I loved Call the Midwife, but I have never seen anything like London Hospital. An original.",1360454400,2013-02-10

5.0,"It was a long wait to get SMASH on dvd but here it is and the wait was well worth it.  I fell in love with this show from the first second of the first episode with Katharine McPhee singing the intro to SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW.  I love the theater and was so excited that a tv show was actually going to honestly display what went into the production and making of a musical.  This show is different than any other on tv.  The cast is amazing.  Debra Messing, Angelica Huston and Jack Davenport are stars known for other tv roles and these roles are like nothing they have ever done.  And we get Megan Hilty and Christian Borle direct from the Broadway and theater world.  All shine.  Borle and Messing in particular have a great chemistry.The plot takes many twists and turns and will keep you totally enthralled.  What holds it all together like glue are the amazing musical numbers.  There are some current songs performed but the best are the songs written for the musical MARILYN that the show is about putting together.  And for me the true star here is Katharine McPhee.  I have always been a fan but the dimensions of her musical talent are astounding.  Her voice is strong, beautiful, powerful and emotive.  When she sings BEAUTIFUL tears will come to your eyes.  But what is most exciting is how well she meets all the demands of music within a Broadway show.  Her singing of the show tunes in combination with her superb dancing is the highlight here for me.  She's definitely got the IT factor.  Each episode has shining moments and the whole cast is exceptional but for me the whole season builds to the superb final episode and in particular the closing song.  What a high note to end the season on.  There are only 15 episodes here but they perfectly build a story of relationships, drama, dreams, fears, trials and tribulations while showing all the steps in the making of a musical.My only disappointment is that the show was only released on dvd.  I was waiting in high anticipation for a blu ray of this.  The show with all its glitz and glam and superb musical numbers definitely merited it and I also think all true die hard fans would have gone with the blu ray.  But I will settle for the dvd.  I've already rewatched the entire 15 episodes twice and I highly recommend getting this show on dvd.  And don't think you have to love the theater to like this show.  As stated the acting is superb, and the music will pull you in.  The rivalry between Hilty and McPhee is a fun factor in the season but just a glimpse into the whole story line there is.  I can't wait for season 2 in February!  Ane more McPhee!",1358467200,2013-01-18
4.0,"After the huge cliffhangers of the season 2 finale, season 3 seemed the beginning of an awesome season. This first part of season 3 is not the exception. Season 3 makes some big changes (for good), and the story just grows more and more with each episode. With this part of season 3, I felt like it was a little weaker comparing it to seasons 1 and 2, that had exciting episodes all the time, but I still think season 3 was solid enough to keep me entertained as a viewer, We get to meet new characters that have huge parts on the story (Kali, the twins, Jennifer, Cora), and that keep this season moving as we see the main characters dealing with new issues that come along with the new characters. The cast is definetely good. But I felt there wasn't enough Lydia until the last 5 or 4 episodes of the season. She needed more screen time! The Decaulion plot felt a little weak sometimes, but by the last episodes they finally give it the quality it needed since the beginning.But anyway, the quality of the series is still good, the plot twists and the little jokes are still there and overall, the show is so unpredictable.

4.0,I liked Justified since season one so four was basically more of the same. I'm not a hick from the back woods of anywhere and I don't care for &#34;duck dynasty&#34; but this a good viewing. My only negative is the producers are making the main character seem stupid when it comes to the relationship with the ex. Real men are kind of dumb when it comes to women and their emotions but eventually we get it so dumbing Raylin down takes away from his character in my opinion of course.,1389484800,2014-01-12
4.0,"The main plot of this series is great.  The acting is far from perfect and the script makes me cover my face in shame once in a while, but there's enough good in the series to make it watchable.  The character of Ichabod is fantastic, even if he's ridiculously progressive for a guy from the 18th century.  I wish John Cho got more screen time.I recommend skipping episodes 2-5 if you don't like filler.  Sure, they contain some information that's relevant to the plot, but for the most part they're boring monster-of-the-week stories that fail to excite.  Several of these episodes are filled with bad/pointless/boring/just plain stupid dialogue, often between Abbey and Ichabod (&#34;I don't believe anything unless I see it, though I saw crazy supernatural stuff last week--hey, I must have imagined it&#34;) and Abbey and Irving (&#34;don't even bring up that horseman, detective&#34;--&#34;But sir, something weird is happening!&#34;).As of episode 6 (and continuing through episode 8), they're back on the Headless Horseman plot, which I hope plays through nicely to give us a satisfying season finale.  I also hope the writers wrap up the show in one season, instead of trying to get a few more seasons by bringing in bigger baddies (where do you go from Moloch?  Could Abbey and Ichabod just work through the list of Judeo-Christian demons?  Would the show even get approved for another season?  They're supposed to spend seven years as witnesses but I can't see how that could possibly happen unless they do a few time jumps between episodes).",1385337600,2013-11-25

4.0,"Basic Idea, Sherlock Holmes redone for our times.Watson has a sex changeHolmes is just getting out of rehab.And they all moved to New York, where Aiden Quinn serves as some high placed police detective or what not.Gone is Mycroft, instead there's Sherlock's father who is never seen, nor heard from, only emails to Watson that we never get to see.  (Plot mistake in my mind)To give it credit it gives a nod to the Sherlock of old, but the plots aren't the same derivative mutations of classic plots that I've seen in the past (granted it's been a good 40 years since I read the original stories, many of my little gray cells have died since then (apologies to Agatha Christie).)Still plots are intelligent, the puzzle of the murders are decent and they don't cheat overly.  If you pay attention you have a good chance of following along.Character interaction, which is something that I really prize in a series gets off to a shaky start, but has progressed and gotten considerably more solid as episodes have progressed.It's taking it awhile to evolve, but I think there's a lot of potential if they keep taking it in the same direction and as of right now, episodes are quite enjoyable.Not as good as Sherlock (BBC Series) yet, but there's a lot more of it to enjoy.And from what I'm reading, there may only be a third season with 2-3 episodes if you're lucky and an end to that whole thing.Bottom line, up and coming, recommended",1353369600,2012-11-20
3.0,"The Bay is a message hidden within a film, similar to 2008's the Happening, The Bay tells of the consequences of destroying our environment. In this film, dumping into the Chesapeake Bay has caused a harmless fish parasite to evolve into a human killer. What makes this film unique is the way in which it was shot. The film is shot as a documentary that was posted on a fictional Wikileaks type site, and tells the story of the outbreak in a small Maryland town, on July 4th. The cinematography is made up of everything you'd see at a small town festival, camcorders, cell phone cameras, news footage, police dash-cams, and security cameras. Through a collection of footage from the day, we are told the story of the outbreak by one of the only survivors, who had to let the world know of this tragedy that was covered up by the U.S. government. The different angles and the fact that their really weren't any main characters also make this film unique. The story really isn't much, as it just like a million other horror films. Everything is normal, until people start getting sick, and chaos ensues. It's not the story or even the actors that keep you interested in this film, it's the different pieces put together in documentary form by the narrator, Kether Donohue. Without the narration, it's just a collection of web clips, but there is some interest in finding out what happened to each of the people we see and in seeing them figure out what's going on at the same time that we do. It's not a great story and there aren't any stand out performances, but the film itself is done in such a unique way, that it will be like nothing you've ever seen before. Yes, The Bay is another way of telling us about the dangers of not caring for our environment, in a story that is severely lacking imagination, but it's worth seeing, simply from a stylistic point of view.",1377734400,2013-08-29
5.0,"I really enjoyed this TV series, and I found it superior to season one.In season two, the relationship between Dr. Brennan and Booth is well developed, albeit unpredictable, especially with the newly introduced and sexy new boss. There are a lot of tensions, thrills, passions, conspiracies, and sex in this season. Some episodes were extremely well though-off and intriguing. I did like the most the episode on the astronaut. Are there aliens from outer space, and did one just fall down to Earth? Watch the episode to find out.This series will teach you a lot of medical terms as well as how crimes are committed (and how not to commit crimes).",1215302400,2008-07-06

4.0,"Despite a somewhat tepid critical reaction, I was still looking forward to the British crime drama ""Welcome to the Punch."" The movie is loaded with a tremendous cast that includes James McAvoy, Mark Strong, David Morrissey, Peter Mullan, and Andrea Riseborough. This, along with stylish action and beautiful cinematography, made the film a lot more involving than I had anticipated. Trust me, nighttime in downtown London has never looked so glorious! At the heart of ""Welcome to the Punch"" is a weathered cop (McAvoy) and the seasoned criminal (Strong) that haunts him. We've seen this obsessed cat-and-mouse dynamic played out in countless other films, but the evolution of their relationship still seemed quite fresh. As they both get involved in a dense plot of corruption and murder, they may have surprising common interests. And as the film progresses, I was more and more caught up in this developing bond. In the capable hands of McAvoy and Strong, this tenuous alliance has more impact and tension than a dozen well choreographed shoot-outs.The movie begins with a rather improbable chase through the deserted streets of London. McAvoy pursues Strong relentlessly and single-handedly before being shot through the knee. With Strong escaping, McAvoy's knee injury remains a physical reminder of this fateful night that changed his career irrevocably. Fast forwarding three years, McAvoy is distant and surly. Paired with Riseborough, the two are investigating a recent shooting that is leading nowhere. When, however, Strong's son is apprehended with a gunshot wound, department attention shifts to the potential to draw his father out of hiding. As Strong returns to action to find out what happened to his son, a reinvigorated McAvoy sees a chance at redemption. What neither of them expect, though, is that both quests will uncover a much bigger picture. There is nothing particularly new in the plotting of ""Welcome to the Punch."" Questions of greed, police corruption, and political maneuvering paint a familiar story that has frequently been portrayed in films of this type. Ultimately, though, this one is sold by its actors.From an action standpoint, ""Welcome to the Punch"" has plenty of fire power. It is a stylized violence, however, so over-the-top at times that it wouldn't be out of place in a John Woo epic (minus the requisite doves, of course). You might wonder in a hotel shoot-out why Strong can't hit a guy in the same room with an automatic weapon, but can slide across the floor under fire and hit a much smaller canister target. But such is the nature of these scenes. Instead of exploring the complicated back story in too much depth, the finale instead results in an uncompromising gun fight. By doing so, many of the plot threads are left twisting in the wind. I'd have preferred the screenplay to satisfy more of these unanswered questions. And for this lack of real resolution, I'd rate ""Welcome to the Punch"" at 3 1/2 stars. I will round up, though, for the central performances. I quite liked this one despite my reservations. KGHarris, 7/13.",1374192000,2013-07-19

5.0,"I was not sure I was going to stick with it initially, but once the 2 dimension part came into play it was gripping. The first part seemed like a bunch of disconnected plots that the Fringe team had to solve. Over time, it became apparent that these were linked and it comes together several episodes into the story so don' give up if you are a SciFi junkie.The characters are interesting and compelling although the Doc can do some pretty good mental loop-d-loops on a frequent basis.I like the contrasting character and character interactions between the same people across the 2 dimensions.",1356393600,2012-12-25
2.0,"Yeah, well, I have no idea what I just watched.  It was like a drunken conversation come to life.  A monster who looks like he escaped from an 80's horror flick like Ghoulies or Troll crawls out of a guy's ass--literally--and kills people who may bring the guy harm or undue stress.First, thank GOD Michael Bay did not make this film.  The plot is up his alley, but I think no one would be able to take his obsession with explosions.  If you get me.Secondly, I have no idea why you might WANT to watch this movie.  You have to be REALLY bored, 12 years old, or just love butt horror.  (Is that a genre now?)Here's why:I love a couple of the cast, so I thought it might be funny.  Unfortunately, it is just slow and silly.  What is funny is that the acting is pretty great!  I guess, if it had been written well, Bad Milo might have been a comedic hit.Instead it is a smirk-fest.

4.0,"I'll admit it. I watch Hoarders for just one reason, to get motivated to declutter and clean my home.  &#34;Hoarders&#34; is among the very best for that.  While most hoarding-type shows are sensational and consistently extreme, this series often features people who started out just a little over-the-line in terms of owning too much stuff.Those are the shows that get me to hit &#34;pause&#34; and go weed out the kitchen cupboard, or under the bathroom sink, or that stack of books that won't fit in the bookcase.It's a reminder that we often lose sight of how cluttered our homes are... how easy it is to say &#34;I'll find a place for that,&#34; or &#34;I might have a use for that, later,&#34; and end up with stacks of unused items.  They aren't trash, but that's what makes them difficult to let go of.Anyway, I'm really enjoying this series via Amazon Prime, and it's keeping me ahead of the clutter.",1371686400,2013-06-20
3.0,"I read the book a while back--all 1,000+ pages of it--and as a long-time Stephen King fan, I enjoyed his verbosity and virtuosity.  The TV version promises to be as long-winded as the book, since it will be coming back for a second season, so I wonder what exactly King will add to it to make us care that these people are still trapped under the dome.This take on UTD is soapier, sexier, and with nastier bad guys.  I kinda sorta like it--it's entertaining enough for a summer evening--but it is what it is:  an escapist TV series, soon forgotten.  I'm feeling more claustrophobic every week just thinking about all those disparate characters trapped together.

4.0,"Imagine a cross between ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Murder She Wrote,"" set in a quaint Maine town where weird things happen every week.That's the best description I can come up with for ""Haven,"" a paranormal crime show very loosely adapted from Stephen King's novel ""The Colorado Kid."" The first season starts off on a rather mediocre note with a string of one-off ""troubles,"" but slowly develops a mysterious arc that grows more intriguing and powerful as time passes.FBI agent Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is sent to the town of Haven to find an escaped murderer... but as soon as she arrives, she finds that the guy is dead... and his death was physically impossible.Not only does Haven have some bizarre people and strange weather patterns, but Audrey finds that she has a connection to the place -- an old photo with a woman who looks just like her. So she decides to stay in Haven, and partners up with local cop Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryan) to solve local crimes while she searches for hints to her past.However, it turns out that the ""troubles"" are returning to Haven after thirty-ish years -- mysterious aging, outbreaks of madness and sanity, spontaneously rotting food, horrible deaths related to artwork, a shadowy ""Dark Man"" (no, not the one Stephen King fans are thinking of!), a deadly shapeshifter, fiery deaths, a poltergeist and countless ground cracks.""Haven Season 1"" takes a little time to bloom. At first the acting is stiff, the one-off plots are ordinary, and there's no strong overarcing plot except ""the troubles are back!"" But as time goes by, the stories get darker and the writing becomes more compelling -- especially since only some of the mysteries center around stuff you can arrest people for.Each episode introduces a new bizarre occurrence, and has Nathan and Audrey trying to unravel whose powers are going out of control. These mysteries are fairly clever, and there are some funny moments sprinkled in every episode (""I need a HUUUUUGG!""). And despite being based on a King novel, most of it isn't horrifying -- there are some creepy moments, such as a poor guy's eyes, ears and mouth slowly sealing up before our eyes. Eww.Emily Rose is kind of stiff in the first few episodes, but she becomes a really likable heroine by the halfway point of the series -- she's strong, compassionate, playful and has some shocking secrets of her own. Bryan plays Nathan as reclusive and quiet, mainly because he can't physically feel anything. And there are some solid side performances by Eric Balfour as a charming smuggler, Nicholas Campbell as the gruff sheriff, and Anne Caillon as Nathan's girlfriend.""Haven"" hasn't fully unfolded into the great show it might become, but the first season shows it starting to really bloom -- and leaves you wanting more.",1302480000,2011-04-11

4.0,"I'm a sucker for Sherlock Holmes. I was shamelessly addicted to the Granada series starring Jeremy Brett and the BBC's 'Sherlock' is one of my favorite shows still running on TV. Needless to say I'm enjoying 'Elementary' so far, even if I think there's room for improvement.One big thing 'Elementary' has going for it are the main characters. Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are a terrific team as Sherlock Holmes and Joan Watson and their sober-companion relationship (both are recovering drug-addicts) gives a unique dynamic to these familiar characters; Watching Holmes explain his brain functionings to Watson after a sober meeting only to have her counter his ridiculous logic (""the brain doesn't even work like that!"") was a hoot in this episode as well as seeing elements of the traditional Holmes (Watson finding his violin) shine through. I hope there's more familiar elements to come though; I like the idea that Miller is the traditional Sherlock who's completely fallen off the wagon but is now trying to put himself back together.While the character-work by the leads is first-rate in 'Elementary' the mysteries are all over the place, as is Holmes' deductive process. Perhaps it's an attempt to separate itself from 'Sherlock' and 'House' but the randomness (and unlikeliness) of 'Elementary's solutions makes everything feel cheap and artificial. That the supporting cast seems to be phoning it in doesn't help (and while I like Aidan Quinn and Jon Michael Hill I wish they had more to do than butt-heads with our detectives).So two episodes in I still like 'Elementary' even with my gripes. I love watching Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu and it gives me something to look forward to each week. I do hope the show gains a bit more confidence with it's stories and dips a bit more into the Sherlock Holmes canon (we have hints of Sherlock's father....perhaps an alias for his brother Mycroft?). But for now it's a fun enough show with two great main characters (and one awesome opening sequence!).",1351296000,2012-10-27

This season was very funny, with some great stories, and some of my favorite episodes, but saw a show that is losing its focus.  For instance (spoilers) the introduction of Holly was great, she worked well and the show and was a great foil for Michael, funny, dorky, and very likable.  But after only a few episodes she's gone.  Similarly, we get the Andy/Dwight/Angela love triangle come to a hilarious peak, but without any real consequences or fallout.  The story just ends without a whole lot of mention.  Then we get one of my favorite story lines, the Michael Scott Paper Company, which ends as quickly as it began.  (End Spoilers)  I guess that was the biggest problems with season 5, lots of great ideas that aren't fully realized.  That being said the show is still very funny, and the overall melancholy of season 4 is long gone.

The young actors are great - not cutesy, not overdone.  Dialogue was what I'd expect from kids that age - not adult dialogue stuffed into the mouths of kids as in so many network shows.  I had to laugh about Ranger substituting names of fruits and vegetables for curse words, to cure himself from swearing as I can relate to that!  I think I'd actually watch this show myself, even without kids!",1391904000,2014-02-09
5.0,There is nothing bad or off about Justified. Season 5 is the best so far.  The entire cast rocks it!,1397088000,2014-04-10
4.0,"The Rebels is an Amazon Original Pilot.  The show stars Julie (Natalie Zea) who is in over her head when her husband suddenly dies leaving her as sole owner of The LA Rebels, a pro-football team.  The supporting cast is also very good and the show has some real funny points.  I think this show would benefit from a full season treatment from Amazon.  I enjoyed this show and would definitely recommend it to others.Thank you for reading my review.",1393113600,2014-02-23
5.0,"I recommend all of his programs. Alton Brown does an excellent job of teaching, preparing food and entertaining! I think of him as the &#34;Bill Nye the science guy&#34; of cooking. He lures me in with humor and the next thing I know I've learned something new!",1379289600,2013-09-16

5.0,By today's standard violent/graphic TV fare- This series is a little bit restrained. That is exactly why I like it! You can watch and have a nice pleasant feeling at the end when Father Brown solves the mysteries. You do not feel upset by violent criminals and &#34;everybody's an FBI agent&#34; or &#34;sleazy lawyer&#34; type of TV.This is great entertainment!! Set in England around1974-75 the stories invole quaint small English villiages and their interesting inhabitants. I recommend highly!,1400889600,2014-05-24

3.0,"""Rome"" is almost like two different productions smashed together. One of them is a classic well-acted account of the politics and history of Rome in the days of Ceaser. The other production involves ""history of the common people"" and enough graphic sex 'n violence to get a mass audience to watch it. The first production would get five stars from me but the other would get one star. So in the end, it gets three.At the top of the production, there is an excellent cast playing out the classical story of Julius Ceaser from the point where he decided to return from Gaul to his assasination in the senate. The portrayal of Ceaser is incredible. Its really able to get across the concern about what Ceaser's intentions really are and how he is using everyone around him. The other characters in the civil war are equally well done. Pompey is rightfully portrayed as Ceaser's equal rather than a fool or a loser. The personalities of Mark Anthony and a very young Octavian perfectly set up the inevitability of what is to come. The only character whose portrayal fails is Brutus. Rather than an idealistic leading man of Rome, Brutus is written as an immature fool. The writers were obsessed with making Brutus the scorned illegitimate child of Ceaser and explaining everything about the historical character from that point of view. It doesn't work at least for me.Attached to the production is a modernistic ""everyman"" history in the form of two soldiers. They are supposed to weave into the plot to show the lives of everyday romans. But for me, it doesn't really work. They are inserted into key events in every episode in really clumsey ways. Having one of them trigger the civil war and then later be the actual father of Ceasar's child by Cleopatra is just silly. There is also an adultery plot that runs the entire season that just isn't very interesting. It would have been better to ditch the two everyman and bring in character actors for single episodes to play the roles that common people might play in the plot. Both actors are excellent though. They are actually playing far above the material they are being given.Nobody can deny that violence was a part of Roman life. Where the production gets it wrong however is when it does ""look at me"" sorts of sex and violence that don't in any real way advance the plot and are just there to draw in a certain kind of audience.The accurancy of its portrayal of ordinary Roman life is up for question anyway. The reason most productions on rome focus on the top layer of society is that we have books from the period written about those people. We don't have much as far as accounts of common rome go and all too often, archelogy combined with imagination gets substituted for solid history. And all too often, the view of sexuality in roman society is based on a couple writers who wrote tabloid style scandal material either for the political opponents of the elite or for the people in every age who consume such things.Properly edited down, ""Rome"" would be a first-class production. As it is, like most of the material funded by HBO its flawed by an attempt to draw in a bigger audience through salting in lots of sex 'n violence.",1172016000,2007-02-21

5.0,Sci-fi fans have been waiting for Chris Carter to have a follow up to the X-Files for a long time. The After is that show.Something has happened that has shutdown all of the power. We later find out that the water has been shut off also.

5.0,This is a much watch because you can probably identify with the various characters in the show and think of someone you have in your league.  This is not a show to watch with the family (some crude references).But it is a must-see.Randy,1396569600,2014-04-04

5.0,"Finally, a family friendly comedy that is both funny and original. Eddie Murphy, an ambitious financial investor, comes to believe his daughter's blanket can give him sound financial advice! Meanwhile, his competitor, Thomas Haden, uses Native American mysticism and animal aphorisms to woo clients. Add to this the adorable Yara Shahidi, who plays Murphy's daughter, andImagine Thatmakes for the first truly enjoyable comedy I've seen in years. The ending got a bit cliche, but at least it was done with style (Eddie Murphy's final wardrobe is quite fashionable!).

I think a sequel would be nice.

5.0,This show is hilarious. I love Tim Allen he truly plays a great part in this show. The writers have done an amazing job creating situations to make all of its cast shine. If you want to just crack up and watch a heart warming family comedy I encourage you to watch this show.,1383436800,2013-11-03

5.0,"In case you aren't familiar with the show, this is the final season DVD set.It's a TV show that lasted 10 seasons and gave the viewers a realistic world of science fiction that often made you think if it's really fiction.Imagine finding an ancient artifact that allows you to travel light years away to another planet and explore the unknown. What you discover is fascinating, exciting and dangerous; We are not alone and we are not as advanced species as we once thought.I've been a Stargate SG-1 fan since the beginning.This DVD will complete my collection as I already seen all the episodes.  This is for my personal archive of what I consider the best Science Fiction show.I have been a long time fan of Science Fiction.  I watched various Star Trek Series, Space 1999, The Avengers, Doctor Who, just to name very few.I loved them all for what they gave me; a momentary escapism.  They all have given me a place where I can immerse myself and enjoy the wonder of another place and time.Then came the Stargate SG-1.  I'm sure many will argue what is the most influential SciFi of all times.  But if you ask me what show gave me the most satisfying and lasting impression as the best SciFi, it's Stargate SG-1.I have to thank the writers and the chemistry of actors who made it the most enjoyable show.",1187827200,2007-08-23

I only wish my family could be just a smidgeon of what this family is all about. I know this is TV but I have many cousins and their families and they are very similar to those depicted in this show. Communication, love, help, caring, trust, it's all there and more!

5.0,"I didn't expect a lot out of this Onion News comedy. It's like HBO's ""Newsroom"" meets ""Airplane."" Very funny, very quick and enjoyable. It is an absurd kind of humor with a lot of slide-in scenes -- kind of like Family Guy. I just liked everything about it.",1368057600,2013-05-09
4.0,"I'm not the first to mention that SGU looks a lot like Battlestar Gallactica with a stargate. The sets and lighting are dark. Characters are in conflict much like BG. A lone spaceship is up against long odds, surviving on its own without friends ... check.Yet the writers have done a good job of creating a compelling story arc with believable and interesting characters. There is a nice variety of stand alone adventure to go with the continuing plot, and the problems faced are entertaining. Throw in a touch of Gilligan's Island as the voyagers occasionally have ephemeral prospects of rescue dangled before them, and the show has borrowed from just about every popular sci-fi/marooned cast series you might be able to name. Despite this, I find almost every episode to be an interesting watch ... unlike Santuary, which teeters precipitously between fascinating and boringly tedious (and is still in production anyway).SGU may signal the end of the very long running Stargate franchise. That's a shame. I've enjoyed it since the first episode of Stargate, which in a change from the normal circumstance was so much better than the movie it wasn't even close. I'll miss it, as I miss new Star Trek.However, this first season doesn't have to worry about cancellation. It built a premise and built it well. Its a good rendition of the desert island theme, with the marooned crew making do with what they have, discovering what their tools can do, and developing new ways to find supplies and survive. However, I'd look to watch the reruns on cable before I plopped down the cash for the DVDs.",1305072000,2011-05-11
4.0,"I very much enjoyed the lead actress (Natalie Zea) in this role.  The concept is not overly original, but I still liked everything about it.

I would actually make a point to come back for more of this one.",1392854400,2014-02-20

5.0,"Some spoilers......This show remains as dark, gripping, and challenging as ever.  The Cylon rebels break away from the others, while the humans still struggle with the fact that any one of them could be revealed to be a Cylon--at any time.  The cast gives powerful performances all around, and the revelation to Adama by a certain person was wrenching to watch.  Olmos showed the anguish and shock that any one of us would feel upon learning that a trusted confidante was never a human at all.Richard Hatch, from the original series, is great with his delivery and timing.  He should be given more employment.  James Callis as Baltar leads us into uncharted territory as he becomes a religious cult leader, while Mary McDonnell shows how hard it is to maintain grace and hope while battling cancer.Then they get where they wanted to go, and....oh, I can't tell you, but of course they had to leave us hanging there!",1231804800,2009-01-13
5.0,"Wonderful series, wonderful Doctor, and a great Christmas special.  I really hope the Specials will continue to come out and we will get to see more of Matt Smith as the Doctor.  He filled all the previous Doctors's shoes and stretched them out a bit.  If you can ignore the 1 star reviews from short-sighted customers, get this.As fas as the 1 star reviews, I would have agreed that amazon charging for the sneek peek for the Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe was insane, but they figured it out as customers pointed it out to them, and they confirmed it was a mistake.  For the day it took them to fix this, I find that those that were so quick to complain openly instead of just reporting it to amazon and getting a refund, are way out of line.  I bought it, received a refund, didnt lose my tv pass, got the sneek peek back, and understand that things go wrong at times. It seems people forget that Amazon has the most amazing customer service out there and whine openly as soon as one thing goes wrong.  Your reviews complaining and giving one star are completely redundant now, but oh well.",1324857600,2011-12-26

5.0,"Alton Brown is informative and Quirky and it works!!! I love how he takes an educational, often scientific approach to cooking.  He shows us why those ingredients when mixed up in a pan or bowl do what they do and TA DAA, they become food.  It sounds like magic but it's not, it's chemistry.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a sleeper coarse-he is so entertaining while doing what he does. He offers new approaches to classics and new ideas that the classics simply weren't able to touch upon! His shows are based around single main ingredient and he offers various ways to use it.  He educates, briefly, understanding everything from simple chemical reactions to government regulations and so much more.  Believe me, his information may sound like it is not useful once you are in the kitchen, ready to cook, but it is because 1 word difference in a supermarket can mean the difference of  $5. or more!

3.0,"Have seen a lot worse, and a lot better. This is one of those SciFi Saturday Specials that falls in between; not quite a pile of crap - but a far cry from the smelliest pile that's ever been produced.What I would have appreciated was primer, something a lot more clear than what's provided to us at the beginning of the film. So that's what I'm going to do for you here. If the premise sounds ridiculous - it is. So you need to make up your mind as to watching it based on the primer itself.Ready?Okay here it is: For some unknown reason an alien enemy has decided that it needs to destroy mankind. Now, normally that would be via war or invasion. But in this case the aliens have decided to use a manufacturing plant that pumps out humans converted into zombies.These zombies are very difficult to kill, very strong, and come equipped with their own arm pike/blade/pick-axe. Their mission is to destroy humanity, and those that somehow survive their initial rabid assaults, are then pulled back to the manufacturing plant for conversion to new zombies.Got that so far?So when this first happened mankind was nearly destroyed. But with one last ditch all-or-nothing supreme effort - humanity fought back and won a stalemate by burying the manufacturing plant and sealing it off.We now jump ahead a few thousand years. The previous global destruction bought about vast changes in civilization and (importantly) most of what happened before the aliens attacked has been forgotten; mankind has rebuilt themselves to a version of the world circa 1915 - a time when we are literally reliving World War I. Trench warfare, doughboys, kaiser inspired troops, gas attacks, etc, etc. A few notable differences are that the world is run by corporations not governments and they have steam powered flying ships.Got that?Okay, so during this continuous corporate battle for resources - battle troops accidentally release the seal holding back the zombie manufacturing plant and then all hell breaks loose - literally.Again on the verge of being wiped out - a small band of heroes sets off to end the threat once and for all, led ostensibly by a monk/priest of the old order. The same ones who led the battle against the aliens the last time. They are the only remaining believers - the rest of world, especially the corporations, think they're quaint ridiculous religious nuts. But they held onto the records from the last battle and are the only ones who have the secret to ridding themselves of the zombie machine.That's your primer. Now it's on you to decide whether or not you want to watch the film.I will add this - the director seems to have borrowed much from the same team that brought about the Angelina Jolie film ""Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow"" in that much of the film is digitally created with real actors working against a green screen. But that's not a bad thing. The CGI driven scenes are surprisingly good and mostly believable.The storyline is an another thing altogether. I will say that Thomas Jane does a pretty bang-up job as the hard drinking, war weary veteran enlisted to stop the aliens.",1286755200,2010-10-11

5.0,"This is a very fast-paced show with an interesting topic: can you tell if someone is lying to you? Sometimes there are minor problems with certain episodes such as continuity issues (the good doctor sustained significant facial injuries in the previous show but there is no sign of all that now), and I do get a little tired of Dr. Lightman's abrupt start to just about every confrontation or even just a conversation with his daughter, but the premiss keeps me coming back, and binge watching this series is less fattening that binge eating that bowl of potato chips, plus I think maybe I've learned something about human nature. All in all, the program is well done with intelligent problem solving and high tension episodes. I do wonder why the Dr's scruffy face always looks as though he might have shaved 2 or 3 days before, no matter the time of day or night that the episode starts. I know that's the current style for &#34;manliness&#34; but I wouldn't mind if he did start a show or two clean shaven, and we could see his beard grow during long periods of time. Instead, he just looks slovenly. Can't tell if he ever showers or changes his clothes.

3.0,"This would have been a fairly boring medical show, if it was filmed in average USA town with working class or middle class patients. But what makes it watchable is the fact that it is filmed in the beautiful Hamptons and all the scenery and people are opulent, super rich and pretty. But even then, the show follows a predictable formula, and since Dr. Hank Lawson was an ER doctor, now turned concierge doctor for the rich, every case he deals with is a baffling emergency case. The syndromes and symptoms the patients have are new in every episode and very uncommon and bizarre in real life. Have you ever heard of &#34;a foreign accent syndrome&#34; for instance? You will, if you watch this silly medical show.",1401321600,2014-05-29

5.0,"Note: I just saw the entire first season with XFinity On Demand.Alcatraz. The most infamous prison in the world. The worst scumbags in the United States Of America are housed here. On March 21, 1963, a convoy was sent to pick them up, as Alcatraz officially closed due to unsafe conditions. But when the guards arrive, no one is inside. Why? Now, in 2012, the inmates are returning. One by one. Why?These questions, and more, form the unique premise of Alcatraz. Sam Niell (who could very well have also played James Bond at the same time Pierce Brosnan did) stars as Emerson Hauser, an FBI agent bent on catching all of the prisoners. Jorge Garcia (""Lost"") also stars as Diego Soto, an expert on Alcatraz. Like Hauser, he is also baffled by why the inmates are returning. Sarah Jones stars as Rebecca Madsen, a cop who unwittingly has a connection to one of the prisoners...And Parminder Nagra (""Bend It Like Beckham"") stars as Dr. Lucy Banerjee, a colleague of Hauser who may or may not be connected to Alcatraz...The series is engaging, from the two-hour pilot to the action-packed and emotionally gripping two-part season finale. Equal part drama and action, the series deftly balances both. My only question is, did they have to cast a fat guy as Rebecca's partner? Some romantic tension in the series between the two main leads would be nice.I hope the series is renewed for a second season.EDIT-5/11/11I found out last night that Alcatraz has officially been closed...for good. Which is unfortunate, as it was good from the two-part pilot episode until the two-part season finale, and the mysteries just kept coming on strong. Bad move, FOX.",1332892800,2012-03-28

2.0,"As a classical music lover, one who is well-informed, I found this show to be a tasteless exaggeration of issues in the dying classical world. I was particularly put-off by Bernal's ridiculous appearance (I think a stab at Gustavo Dudamel) and at the misuse of the wonderful Malcolm MacDowell, who is made to over-enunciate, when I've seen him command the English language like a fine musical instrument in the past.

The show doesn't do goofy cheap special effects but really works hard to make the show and it's characters believable. But what would one expect when Steven Spielberg is involved, even sometime's hands on. Overall the show is well worth watching, the only sad part is unlike a soap opera type show or ensamble type show, the show does have a shelf life, there is only so far that a show of this nature can go.

4.0,"This series started as one of the best 10 new TV series coming out but then again so did the Playboy Club which only lasted three episodes. Pan Am lasted 14 episodes with high ratings at 11.06 million but by the 12th episode it was down to 3.74 million (Wiki source). The cast while mostly not known big time (with the exception of maybe Christina Ricci) were attractive and charming and mostly suited for the period. So why did a TV series that opened it's first season with a $10M budget fail to keep going? One stewardess became a spy for the CIA (which was partly based on fact), another ends up dating an Arab prince, another is a liar with a past she doesn't want exposed and still another is the hot blonde who is trying to find meaning in her life. Amidst all of this are romances with various male passengers and pilots as well as the historical scope of the 1960s, including JFK's visit to Berlin and his later assassination. Sexism, racism and many of those others things we see in Mad Men are apparent but more subdued by comparison. And then there were some of the radical movements for the decade, like focuses on interracial lovers and posing nude for the sake of it being art, not pornography. The costumes and set were impressive and one of the executive producers had a background as a Pan Am stewardess. Nitpickers will note that the pilots are too young to be flying but you have to remember this was something of a ""Mad Men"" add on and they were trying to get younger viewers to watch a recently historical period. Well, maybe they should have tried harder because it didn't work. I suspect ""older"" Americans didn't want to watch a new TV show and the younger crowd saw it as a period of time that was charming but not engaging enough when there were so many other choices out there.I personally felt it was too safe and the issues it covered while radical back in the 1960s are now mainstream and mostly not controversial for people watching it today, especially those who weren't really around in the 60s as adults like myself. The quality of some of the subplots dipped in the middle, too. All said, though, I suspect it had more to do with the creators not pushing this series forward enough and making it edgy. Pan Am played it too safe and that's why it eventually had to be grounded.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; THEMES/FOCUSES OF THE 1960s: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 2011 to end of March 2012 (streamed).",1332460800,2012-03-23

I love to see the kids dance but the behavior of these Moms are making it difficult for me to continue watching.  I would get rid of Christy and Kelly and leave Nia's Mom and Asia's with a new group of Moms.  What happened in New Orleans was unbelievable, especially because these women are supposedly wealthy enough to have had some education.  Although their grammar is horrendous.

3.0,"It's a bit too early as of yet, however, all 3 stories that were shared in both the free preview, and the first episode, were stories that I'd already seen covered by other Paranormal/Ghost television series such as: My Ghost Story or A Haunting. I am NOT saying their stories may or may not be true. In fact, they were very believable and....frightening!  What I don't believe; is this is original material for this ""New"" upcoming fall television series and, that's a big disappointment. I was really looking forward to seeing this new show every week but now I'm not so sure. The first episode was not much of anything, especially when the  preview seemed to  boast of so much more! Not only was old material presented, it was presented very poorly. I was almost bored to tears. There was no excitement at all. It was like watching a tennis match....between cutout paper dolls.

5.0,"The two episodes that comprised the Pilot were wonderfully a mix of American and European flavor. The case was worth watching, had a wonderful flow, it was actually interesting. The choice of criminal... well the actor was not quite up to the role, in my opinion. Or the choice was a bit wrong to make the character as he was, viciously goofy is the best way I can say it. He came across as more pathetic than anything else. Was there an intent to show that murderers are pathetic little creeps? I wonder. Some intensity was lost because of the murderer's portrayal.I can not explain exactly what intrigued me so much as a show without a compelling villain is usually doomed. Perhaps it is the actors and the beautiful chemistry they have as a group. The loss of one agent/officer, the oldest woman on the team was difficult. She was easy to watch, she captured my attention when she was on the screen. I was sorry to see her character go.Louis is a damaged but charismatic leader, he also has a great command of the screen. His ability to tie into, seem close to, people he has just 'met' is remarkable. The tragedy of his son's death and his wife's mourning rings through him, he is a man in pain, yet a man with purpose as well. He has lost much, but not everything. He is portrayed with an undercurrent of power and pain by an actor of great skill, Marc Lavoine. There are several scenes with Louis and Carl which show these two men are quite close, intimate. Beautifully acted.Carl Hitchner is an addict, clearly going through physical and emotional distress after being shot and disabled (by a child molester?), barely able to use his hand at all, and his frustration is bursting through. The morphine he takes is both for that chronic injury and for the emotional scars that riddle him. he is a man who needs a purpose in order to really live again. I was surprised at the ease with which he came off his addiction. Aside from that, the motivation was he had let his partner go into a situation without him backing her up so that he could take his pain medicine, that was credible as a reason he was determined to give it up or get it under control. It is not until the third episode that we see he is on a lesser opiate with the intimation it is helping him come down from the morphine. (My guess). I like this actor, he is brilliantly in character, has an air of ragged desperation that is well shown, but he remains a man with a talent, a gift at seeing what is around him, what clues that other might miss.Sadly, the woman who died, Sienna, the interrogator, is the most compelling of the female team members. She was quietly intense. I think that keeping her would have been a good decision. But I am interested enough in the show to continue watching despite her death. The bonding between her and the younger, sarcastic, defensive Tommy is entirely believable and is one of the wow moments in the series so far.The young man, Tommy, who is a bare knuckle fighter and some kind of gypsy by birth, is surprisingly charismatic. Also so intense, wounded, with a huge chip on his shoulder as well as a contract on his life, bought by his father. He is probably the manifestation of heart and courage in this show. Of course I am speaking just from watching three episodes. His meanness is never truly nasty, his well of anger, deep and wide.Ann-Marie is easy to watch, fluid and of course quite beautiful. I do not quite understand why she hides her injury, or why anyone would. Doing so not only puts her at risk, but her team as well. I hope there will be further explanation of this trait. It seems to sit oddly with her very responsible, intelligent character.Sebastian. I like him. The IT specialist and also a huge fount of knowledge. The combination of his high tech toys, what he knows and Carl interacting with him is fabulous.Eva is again, beautiful, She is also kind and determined and gives off a great sense of compassion in the right moments. In the third episode she stays with the woman witness who is dying in hospital and remarkably, managed to convey her sympathy without going over the top, not abandoning the woman in her time of death. I hope this will continue to be a part of her character.Donald Sutherland's character Dorn is as wonderful to watch as any role he has ever played.Setting the series in Europe makes the difference. It would be a good show if set in America, a legal ""Leverage"" perhaps, but watching the European locations, the glimpses of other cultures adds depth and more interest. I have bought the season on the basis of watching the first 3 episodes. While the well-oiled flow of the 2 part Pilot was best, the shorter third episode seemed a touch rushed, bam and done. It was still enjoyable to watch.I have high hopes the chemistry between the characters will continue to enhance the series, and that future episodes will be have me watching with as much pleasure as those I've seen so far. As long as the characters aren't paired up in romantic twos I think this will be good entertainment.I do curse the 43 minute episode rule. But what can you do? I hope for more two parters.Addendum: I have watched the subsequent episodes. It seems that in order to make things more interesting there has been a move towards making sure each character has a flaw, a painful history, etc. Hmm. I thought their expertise was quite interesting enough, but I see that there must be redemption arcs for some of the specialists within the team. Now, the question is..will your (or my) favorite character succeed or fail in their redemption? What havoc will be wreaked as they continue to spiral into the depths? Can they be forgiven?In the most recent episode a very pretty young man is taken, held for ransom, his parents hating each other with great venom, so naturally one of them uses their son to get revenge. Daniel is set up to look at the case in one certain way, perhaps because of his own wife's reaction to the death of his son. But we mustn't forget this is the second kidnapping. Dorn is traveling in Russia, seeking Dmitrov in order to avenge the Daniel boy. He needs to know Dmitrov is not involved in the kidnapping. Why? Hmmm, well, Daniel assures Dorn that he was not. But what about the first kidnapping. Was Dmitrov involved in the first one? Because the parents of the current boy taken, did not do that one. Is Daniel wrong? I am left with the question as well, is there a reason that it matters if Dmitrov is involved?By the end of the case... there is the question, will Hickman give in to the offer of taking a payment from the father as a reward? Did Hickman ask for money, was he joking? Is there a reason he shouldn't take it? I mean who could blame him for taking the father up on the reward, he lives in a ratty little trailer (complete with attractive women waiting to bed him). Really? OK. But... Hickman was joking(?)... while another team member, who we learned earlier had a foul vice, overheard and was not. 30,000 Euros. The team is already crumbling. Who is objective? Who can you trust?",1372723200,2013-07-02

5.0,"This is a quiet, contemplative film about two artists: one young and just starting out, the other old and dying.  It examines the nature of the artistic life, whether it requires sacrifice or selfishness or a little of both, and whether, when push comes to shove, you can have it all--family and a regular life as well as your art.  Frank Langella, as always, takes charge, and the story revolves around his character.  Highly recommended.",1397865600,2014-04-19

I still miss the father of the cop character from the first season , but other than that you have a fine ensemble cast. In this one 'audrey' must stop a troubled person from killing off people by drowning them. Is that person evil or is it not their fault that their trouble is killing people off? You never know with this show , as the mystery has played out over the seasons we learn more but there is still more to learn. Which is a good thing. I miss the chemistry between the two leads; parker and the cop. And the mysterious new big city detectives storyline is intriguing.

3.0,"The first two seasons of Ancient Aliens, along with The Pyramid Code, were an epiphany to me, and my paradigm for ancient history has been completely rocked.The third season, despite my highest hopes, is at best a rehash of ideas from the first two.  At worst, and for the most part, they push the package so far past believability, that it's almost as if they were set up by Zahi Hawass and the rest of the established liars to make themselves look as if they need to be wearing foil hats.This season is as disappointing as the previous two were ground-breaking.  I don't know how much more information is currently available because Egypt and other governments seem to be hampering further digging and questioning of established theories.I have always taken a dim view of Biblical stories and other basically silly and unfounded ideas preached by religion about the origins of humans.  However, there are gaps and inconsistencies in the more mundane views of human evolution.  When we see parallel civilizations compared, which may have been highly evolved 20,000 years ago, or more...When we think of how the human brain has tripled in size in a few thousand years and when we see no concrete link between Neanderthaloids and modern humans, to the extent that we would be our current species, the questions only begin.The answers just aren't there in history, archeology, paleontology and absolutely, biblically as to why we are the species we are and moreover, why civilizations evolved so dramatically with technologies we can't approach today in such a short time, and why they devolved almost as rapidly in dark ages, which then redeveloped in entirely different directions.I have seen three different UFOs and photographed one I didn't see until I processed the photos.  I know what I saw, and I know these were not the crafts or technologies of humans, although a great black triangle I witnessed flying over the Front Range near Denver in November of 2002, was no doubt the same craft that had become known as the Phoenix Lights, and has been spotted and photographed many times over the years, could be a terrestrial ""Black Op"" of some sort.  It's sheer size mkes me doubt that hypothesis.I have photographed petroglyphs in Sego Canyon and other areas of Utah and the Southwest which represent characters that although resembling humans, resemble figures in protective suits far more, not to mention glyphs showing floating animals people and hovering craft.There are so many inconsistencies in what we are told, and what we can also see with our own eyes denies those lies.There has to be more, and more cogent arguments than are presented in the third season of Ancient Aliens.  If there is a fourth season, I hope they return to building on what was presented in the first two.This season has some merit, and food for thought, but it is not presented with the revolutionary force and logic of the first two.",1327190400,2012-01-22
4.0,"I seldom review TV shows because there can be so many of hours of material to sort of sift through and contemplate.  HOWEVER, once in awhile, I either feel compelled to add my voice to the chorus of praise, or I happen to see a season in a very compressed timeframe and can articulate something resembling a coherent thought.Such was the case with Season 1 of CALIFORNICATION.  I saw the brief first season in about a one week time span, and here are my thoughts.CALIFORNICATION pretty much  hinges on the ability of David Duchovny to make an insanely unlikeable person likeable.  He plays Hank Moody, the smuggest of writers, a best seller who loathes the movie made of this work.  It is the making of this movie that brought him, his long-time lover Karen and their daughter Becca from NYC to LA.  Upon arriving in LA, Hank and Karen grew quickly apart.  Hank now lives alone and wallows in self-pity, self-loathing (which he turns on everyone around him) and enormous amounts of sex, booze and smoking.  He has an almost magical touch with women wherever he goes, and each 30 minute episode may find him bedding several different women.His only bright spots are the times he spends with his daughter Becca (a stone-faced girl of around 13 or 14 who plays rock guitar, has her father's smart and observant mouth and longs deeply for mom and dad to get back together).  Hank also spends an awful lot of very hot & fraught time with his ex, because we feel that while she has found the love of a stable and rich man who plans to marry her...she is still very much drawn to the exciting & dangerous Hank.Duchovny mostly pulls it off.  If you only know him as Fox Mulder, then his performance here is almost a revelation.  He's disgusting, foul-mouthed, and always unshaven.  I told my wife, ""it strikes me that he would smell bad.""  He's also super-smart and tosses off the most amazingly tart observations on everyone and everything around him.  Duchovny is a smart enough person himself that we actually believe he understands what his character is saying.  (Given the recent revelations about Duchovny and his deteriorating relationship with HIS family...there may be more of him in Hank than I'd like.)  Most of the time, Hank is despicable.  We laugh at his antics and at his credulity-stretching ease with picking up women (although some of the sex scenes are among the funniest parts of the show).  But we also feel the genuine love he has for Karen and Becca.  He's mostly a good father, in a casual California way...and his love for these two women in his life is obvious and believable...thus his character is redeemed to some extent.  He is a man tormented by the mess he's made of his life...but also a slave to his passions.His closest friend is his agent Charlie, played by Evan Handled (Charlotte's husband in SEX AND THE CIY).  Charlie is married to Marcy...but there relationship has tamed down and he's acting out his S&M; fantasies with his secretary Dani.You might get the idea that CALIFORNICATION is not for kids...and you'd be correct!  It is foul-mouthed, contains much explicit sex and generally depicts degenerate lifestyles.But the writing is tart, and much of the acting is first rate.  Duchovny is very good, even if you don't care for the guy he is playing very often.  He balances the role neatly.  Karen is played by Natascha McElhone (the only person in the show, it seems, who won't do nudity).  McElhone has the most ferocious cheekbones!  She does a nice job, although her character seems to be stuck at roughly the same spot all the time.  Evan Handler does well at letting his freak-flag fly and Pamela Adlon, who plays  his wife Marcy, is a revelation.  She reminds me a little bit of Suzie Essman (from CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM) but far racier.  I look forward to seeing her character's progression in Season 2.  Less successful are Madeleine Martin as Becca (I hate, really hate, to say something bad about a child performer...but Becca may actually be more annoying than Hank because her face is virtually incapable of expression, her hair is horrible and her rock vocals are unbearable) and Madeline Zima as Mia, the woman Hank sleeps with in episode one, who turns out to be the 16 year-old daughter of Karen's fianc&eacute;.  This leads to many awkward situations, as you can imagine...but Ms. Zima is unconvincing in the role.  Also disappointing is Rachel Miner's Dani, who plays Charlie's kinky secretary and only manages about 2 expressions in the entire season.Overall, I recommend the series for adults who don't mind some really rough material.  It is witty (seldom laugh-out-loud funny) and the debauchery is sometimes jaw-dropping.  Duchovny earned a Golden Globe for this role, and while he might not have been my first choice for the award, he is certainly perfectly up to this complicated role.",1235779200,2009-02-28

4.0,"Michael Fassbender really gets his (perfect) teeth into this role as a centurion caught in a battle with the Pictish inhabitants in the far north of what was the Roman Empire in 117AD. The real stars of the show are the Scottish countryside and what I believe to be the woods around Buckinghamshire, not far from London. You can die of hypothermia just looking at some of the shots of the Highlands. This is a gore fest of the first magnitude, like Warlords with Jet Li in terms of sheer splatter of blood and brains. Dominic West has a short but telling role in the movie and David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham are first rate. Talked about scarred old soldiers.  Great. JJ Feild does not get to do much, but what he does is important.  The female tracker Etain looks like a young Catherine Zeta-Jones, especially with the woad on.  It is not historically accurate and their Scots Gaelic dialect needs work, plus that is not likely to be what the Picts would have spoken; we have very few records of their language. But for a rolicking adventure with excellent music, scenery and a life and death struggle, there are many worse ways to spend a couple of hours.

3.0,"I was a big fan of Season One of ONCE UPON A TIME and I eagerly anticipated Season 2 on DVD. Season 2 took my by surprise and not in a good way. A fun take on classic fairy tales has become a constant shift of characters and plot lines. ONCE UPON A TIME has put a lot of actors to work as nearly every episode introduces a new character or re-introduces one who has gone missing. The problem is there are so many characters and so many story lines that things are getting beyound silly.The basic theme is good versus evil. Emma, Mary Margarite (Snow White) and David (Prince Charming) have an alliance against Regina (the Evil Queen), Cora (Regina's mother) and Mr. Gold aka the Dark One aka Rumplestiltskin. When good is about to triumph, evil kicks in and the never ending story continues. Back stories keep going on and nothing is linear in time. The modern day was a consistant but that is no longer true as time jumps for the present back 28 years ago.The taking peoples' hearts was over the top this season. Enough of all this! Please!! Tell a story and develop a character and story line. Much to my disppointment a new character with an interesting story appears and is dead in the same episode. Why bother? And the puff of purple magic smoke that is used over and over again by Regina and her mother is used over and over again.There are some great actors in this series but there are so many stories going that it's hard to keep track. Mr. Gold and Regina both try to go ""good"" but nothing good lasts.Portals open and ""humans"" come to Storybrooke and the city's inhabitants are in danger. To confuse matters more, these fairy tale characters are joined by literary characters such as Hook (as in Captain Hook) and Dr. Frankenstein. Are classic TV show characters next.I was disappointed in Season Two but the season finale caught my interest so no doubt, I will be watching Season 3.",1378166400,2013-09-03

There's some kind of plot involving Beast's attempt to steal Lindsey from Ben, but really that's just an excuse to showcase some apocalyptic humor/sight-gags as well as the movie's fairly impressive array of comedic talent.There are quite a few problems here, however. Foremost among them, the script -- by the same guy who brought us Bill & Ted lo these many years ago -- doesn't have the steam to stay interesting. Second, although I've often enjoyed her in the many supporting roles I've seen her in, I'm now convinced Anna Kendrick just doesn't have the chops to carry a film. Her portrayal of our leading lady, Lindsey, has all the riveting depth of a glass of water. (Her boyfriend, Ben, is also about as boring as characters get -- his passion is sandwiches -- and the actor who portrays him is immediately forgettable.) Likewise, I love Craig Robinson, but his Beast is so cartoonishly one-note that it becomes tired pretty quickly, not to mention it robs his character of what little menace he's supposed to have. And he's definitely supposed to have some menace. He's the Anti-Christ, for Pete's sake. Add some story twists that make no sense at all (you know a movie's gone off the rails when it sacrifices coherency for the sake of an easy laugh), as well as a constant (and completely unnecessary) voice over by Lindsey that becomes more and more annoying the longer it goes on, and you've got all the ingredients for a flub.However! All is not lost. The comedians they got to work on this do their damnedest and the results are not without their merits. Rob Corddry, Thomas Lennon, Ken Jeong, Paul Scheer, John Higgins, Rob Huebel (probably my favorite of the film), Ana Gasteyer, and even Robinson when he isn't mugging it up all turn out some pretty solid and laugh-worthy performances. Ignore the uninspired and rote story-telling and focus on the tested comedy muscle, and this film won't be a total wash for you.",1377302400,2013-08-24

3.0,"Horror anthologies have made a triumphant return. With ""V/H/S"" and ""The ABCs of Death"" being released in 2012 and being surprisingly good, these modern takes on the horror anthology are in the same vein as ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""Creepshow,"" and ""Tales from the Crypt."" Less than a year has passed since the release of ""V/H/S,"" an anthology revolving around the handheld perspective, and here we are getting its sequel ""V/H/S/2."" ""V/H/S/2"" won't sway those who hated the first film, but is bound to appeal to those who did.The wrap around story, known as ""Tape 49,"" has Larry (Lawrence Michael Levine) video taping a husband cheat on his wife before getting caught, barely escaping, and then meeting up with his partner Ayesha (Kelsy Abbot) to investigate a missing college kid. Going through the window of a broken down apartment, Larry and Ayesha find a multiple TV setup similar to the one in the first film with the same stacks of video cassette tapes lying around and the addition of a laptop computer. Naturally, Larry has Ayesha watch the tapes to try to find a lead while he investigates the house.Stories include an eye injury leading to a bionic eye implant with a recording chip and glitches that allow the recipient to see the dead, a bike ride in the woods interrupted by zombies, a man promising that he's found a way into paradise, and the pranks of teenagers thankfully being put to rest by an alien abduction.The eye injury story, ""Phase I Clinical Trials,"" has an interesting concept, but a lame execution. It just feels like more could have been done with the glitching aspect and the climax in the pool is underwhelming. The zombie bike ride, ""A Ride in the Park,"" is intriguing. The main character is bitten while wearing a camera strapped to his head, so you basically see the life cycle of a zombie from his perspective. Victims are infected, change rapidly, and throw up a nasty black liquid. There's also an up close and personal shot of the victim eating intestines that is just disgustingly great.""Safe Haven"" is the crowning achievement of ""V/H/S/2."" A man referred to as Father (Epy Kusnandar) leads a cult that is promised a trip to paradise and a journey to immortality. Watching the horror that unfolds is unreal and it's particularly strong. The ending is both outrageous and completely satisfying in the sense that the blood never stops flowing, but the final scene is likely to make you roll your eyes and snicker. Closing out the tapes is ""Slumber Party Alien Abduction,"" which is a rather disappointing effort from ""Hobo with a Shotgun"" director Jason Eisener. Seeing the pranks the kids play gets tiresome very quickly. Its most inventive concept is the dog's perspective, but there's a particularly creepy sequence on a pier and the loud commotion featured whenever the aliens appear is unsettling.Featuring returning ""V/H/S"" directors Simon Barrett and Adam Wingard and uniting them with new directors Eduardo Sanchez (""The Blair Witch Project""), Timo Tjahjanto (""The ABCs of Death""), Gregg Hale, and Gareth Evans (""The Raid: Redemption""), ""V/H/S/2"" is a smorgasbord of horror and violence filled with a variety of ups and downs that is sure to whet the appetite for those craving a bloody trip through hell.",1374192000,2013-07-19

2.0,"The third season of ""Heroes"" was a complete mess.  The season started off in a fairly strong manner, with the heroes targeted by the government and having to work together to escape.  However, this compelling idea was abandoned after a few episodes, with the heroes once again scattering all over the globe with separate (and uninspiring) plotlines.  What the producers and writers consistently fail to understand is that the fans of the show enjoy seeing the heroes work together, and not in the same predictable pairings (Ando & Hiro, Peter & Nathan, etc.).  By the end of the season, I really had no idea what the main plotline was and why I should care about any of it.""Heroes"" started as a fresh, clever series filled with interesting characters, and the producers showed a willingness to add new characters to help prevent things from getting stale.  Unfortunately, the producers and writers really lost the thread by the third season, stubbornly sticking with the same cast of heroes, long past their expiration date.  Particularly frustrating was their stubborn insistence on focusing on Sylar as the main villian; I enjoyed Sylar during the first two seasons but having a nearly unbeatable foe makes the rest of the cast look weak.  Instead of introducing new heroes, each week brought new alliances between the heroes that quickly dissolved before they really could be explored.  One week Noah and Sylar are working together, then they're enemies; the next week Nathan and Peter have reunited, then they're enemies; shampoo, rinse, and repeat.  Keeping up with these shifting alliances was dizzying and tiresome.  Likewise, all pretences of continuity have been abandoned in favor of ending each episode with a ""shocking"" conclusion.I'll watch at least the first few episodes of Season 4 of ""Heroes,"" as I feel a certain obligation given the time I've already invested in the series.  Also, I do still care a bit about a few of the characters, despite being jerked around by the inconsistent writing of the series.  However, I find that I can no longer recommend the series as a whole to new watchers, which is something I did prior to this season.",1249603200,2009-08-07

The mystery continues into season two despite some denials from the protagonist that the agent is not his daughter.

Even tho I purchased the complete first season on Amazon, the pilot episode was SO bad I couldn't watch any others. Why is it so awful? In the first 5 minutes of the show we see the 'Rookies' (everyone looking like a GAP model) drinking & partying like total idiots, having their graduation in a bar. Then we cut to their first day on the job where they spend 90% of their time with their guns drawn saying ""don't make me shoot you"". AWFUL, STUPID, HORRIBLE! This show is an insult to anyone in law enforcement and to the public they serve. Mind you I have no problem with 'pretty actors' doing soap opera/drama. But this show is like watching a bunch of adults run around 'playing' cops & robbers but with real guns instead of toys. With all the great cop shows out their (the new ""Southland"" is terrific, the ""Shield"" was awesome, Patick Swazey's last show ""The Beast"" was great), you don't need to waste your time on this poor excuse for entertainment.",1311465600,2011-07-24

2.0,"This show is very entertaining. HOWEVER, IF you like ""historical"" shows you will HATE this one because it goes so FAR OFF the mark of factual events of that time to such a point that its a laughable joke. First of all King Henry, didn't have a bastard and/or mistress who lived in the castle (which in that time would of never happen), and in REAL history: Mary married Francis once arrived in France; Francis did die around 5 years after their marriage and she remarried in Scotland to rule. She was executed years later by Queen Elizabeth for plotting her assignation. Queen Mary of Scots was NOT this sweet innocent girl they make her out to be in real life. This show goes against everything people of that era believed in. They put 21st century humans with 21st century liberal beliefs in this TV show. This show would of been better if they ""made up fictional characters"" (like in the Game of Thrones) and it would of been accepted and just as popular. I give it 2 stars because, even though I am ""entertained"" by it; I strongly dislike the writers/creators of this show who completely circumvent and PERVERT historical facts. Also, SOUNDTRACK ISSUES: the ""teenage"" pop music might be ""ok"" in selected scenes but it's overkill. In most cases, the soundtrack it doesn't fit. It's like listening to Brittany Spears in really violent horror show (ex. SAW 2, Hostel, etc). LOL! You'll get a good laugh!",1396656000,2014-04-05

It's very unpoliitcally correct in a bad way , but it also does depict how nasty some people are. Meth of course is destroying whole communities , so the writers picked the most offensive drug they could for the character to fall into. After all breaking bad pot man wouldn't be that offensive would it?  The acting is great , with  emmies' won by cast members over the years.

2.0,"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction. When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety. It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes. When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing. Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two. I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect: how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Now here's a leap backwards for ""American Pickers,Volume 4.""I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package), it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!  It's not the price (which is in line with the contents), it's the lack of information that bothers me.I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has eight episodes, a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box?Season Two: (1) Fairlane Fever, (2) Too Hot To Handle, (3) Trading Up, (4) The Emu Chase, (5) Keep Out!, (6) They Boldly Go, (7) The Possum Trot, and (8) California Dreamin.  There are no special features, but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two ""pickers"" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way. Some of the items may have historical significance.  That's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup. In truth, the show has similar appeal to the classic ""Antique Roadshow"" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of ""Storage Wars"" with a dash of ""Hoarders"" thrown in for good measure. It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard. Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.  An interesting show, but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases.  KGHarris, 8/12.",1344297600,2012-08-07

5.0,"I have enjoyed watching MasterChef since day one. The competition is fierce, the food (for the most part) looks amazing, and I'm a big fan of all three judges. (Joe's eyes... WOW!) But what I DON'T like is the trash-talking, backstabbing, immature nonsense that goes on between the competitors. I understand that this is a competition, but their behavior on the show is ridiculous. I'd go so far as to call them childish, but then I'd only be insulting the children! And trust me, after watching only two episodes (so far) of MasterChef Junior, I can honestly say that the children act more mature than the adults. I've seen these young people give each other high-fives, compliment each other, encourage one another, and I've even heard one of the children remark about how another young contestant 'deserves to win' a particular challenge! And even though they sometimes have a difficult time hiding the disappointment from their faces after losing a challenge, (they ARE children... and human), they don't act like sore losers. It's truly wonderful to watch! The adults should pay attention and take notes!And as for the food? I can't believe what these children are preparing! I think my biggest culinary accomplishment, at that age, was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. These children are truly amazing. After witnessing the talent, ambition, and drive that these children possess, I have no doubt, whatsoever, that they will grow up and open their own restaurants. They are an inspiration!

4.0,"With its smarmy, campy over-the-top-in-all-departments verve, Among Friends feels more like the movie Clue (ah, Clue, Leslie Ann Warren, Martin Mull, Christopher Lloyd, Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn...sigh, where have they all gone?) than it does of its torture-porn-as-sick-game siblings, Die and Would You Rather... And Jennifer Blanc is a ringer for Jennifer Anniston. Uncanny! Love the way Alyssa Lobit as sociopath Bernadette keeps cracking her neck, love the way the film starts with Polaroids of all the  key actors (except one) dressing up in gaudy formal, and it's only a few minutes in that you realize that they're going to an 80s-theme whodunit murder mystery party, the kind I avoid at all costs. And glad I do because Bernadette is pretty merciless when it comes to reckoning. It's a little odd that the sins she punishes in a pretty much equal way range from furtive masturbation to downright rape...and then the two minute homily about the &#34;epidemic&#34; of &#34;bystander apathy&#34;, while noble, felt like it had been cribbed from a social worker's favorite brochure. But don't let that detract from the fun, or you might tune out before actress Dana Daurey appears all of a sudden as Lily, who we all forgot about. At least I did! Very nice touch, and Daurey is a comic gem! And cute to boot! Where did she come from? Wait, I know, heaven.",1404086400,2014-06-30
3.0,"Season 2 is essential viewing if you enjoyed season 1 or even if you came to the series late like I did and wanted to start from the beginning to fill in the character back stories.  However, there are some flaws that make it less impressive than the seasons 1, 3, 4, and 5:1. While season 2 has some great moments (particularly for Ben, John, Lydia, Sammy, and Nate), it is clear that the writers probably planned to spread the story arcs out over more episodes than 6.  Most of the arcs get resolved by the 6th episode, but the resolutions don't feel earned, particularly for Sal and Chickie.2. I don't like how Amazon Instant's digital version has all the curse words bleeped out.  I know this is how the show aired, but seasons 1 and 3 have all the curse words unbleeped, so why not the same treatment for season 2?  The bleeps are distracting. I'd rather have no curse words that all the bleeps.If you can put up with these minor flaws, stick through season 2, because seasons 3, 4, and 5 are excellent and will be enhanced by knowing the starting points for the characters.",1367107200,2013-04-28

2.0,I'm always disappointed when a TV show starts out with a fantastic first season and then fizzles in the second.  It's almost like all of the creative energy was used up making the first season and then there's nothing left.  Or maybe they just ran out of things to say.  Either way it looks like it's happening with Revenge and I'm pretty bummed.  Looks like I have to find a new favorite show.,1351123200,2012-10-25
4.0,"Apparently this movie can be seen here on Amazon's Instant Video service, but I just saw it this past weekend in the theatre (at the Landmark E Street in Washington DC). Didn't know too much about the movie but I had seen the trailer for it at some point, and what I saw was intruiging enough for me to check it out.""Deadfall"" (2012 release from Canada; 94 min.) starts off with two parallel opening scenes. In the first, we meet siblings Addison (played by Eric Bana) and Liza (played by Olivia Wilde) as they are in the car after a successful bank heist somewhere in Michigan in terrible weather conditions (heavy snow). The car flips over, leaving the driver dead, and for good measure Addison kills a state trooper who came to check out the accident scene. The car accident itself is brought in a very eye-catching, almost stylish manner. Addison and Liza split up and agree to reunite at the Canadian border. In the second story line, we see Jay (played by Charlie Hunnam) released from jail and meeting up with a boxing buddy of his. An argument ensues and Jay accidentally knocks out (or kills?) his buddy. Fearing a return to prison, Jay flees the scene, and eventually picks up Liza as she is making her way up north as Jay is  driving up to meet with his parents for Thanksgiving. By now the storm is a complete white-out. At that point we are about one-third into the movie and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience.Several comments: this movie felt like a 'film noir' B movie all the way to me, and I say this as a compliment. The movie is action-packed throughout. The acting performances are pretty good, but I really had to do a double-take when seeing some big names like Sissy Spacek and Kris Kristofferson (in small roles are Jay's mom and dad) and even more so Treat Williams (as the town sheriff). How did they end up in a small movie like this? There is no ""message"" in this movie, what you see is what you get: a mindless hour-and-a-half of crime drama, filmed beautifully (in Montreal and surrounding Quebec, substituting for Michigan). Nothing more, nothing less.",1355788800,2012-12-18

5.0,"TV feels inundated with sitcoms, but Modern Family manages to rise about most of the crowd with its interesting characters and unique brand of humor.  From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.Season 4 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season.  The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting, but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work.",1397520000,2014-04-15
3.0,"Zombie Strippers (2008) is a horror comedy that as you might guess from the title, involves a number of women working as strippers who are transformed into zombies.  Reality is pretty much off the table early, as besides taking a few shots at George W. Bush, featuring half naked women getting violent, spilling blood, and engaging in some outrageous acts, is the main point of the film.Sometime in the future, a private company working with the government has developed a Chemo-virus that re-animates the dead, and turns them into relentless fighting machines.  A soldier infected by this formula while on a mission, winds up at a strip club where he attacks a dancer named Kat (Jenna Jameson), turning Rhino gentlemen's club's star attraction into a zombie, who covered in blood, becomes an even more popular performer.Club owner Ian Essko (Robert Englund) sees his staff of strippers gradually being transformed into infected homicidal zombies who murder his clientele, however he isn't too concerned, since profits are way up.  The talent includes Gaia (Whitney Anderson), Lilith (Roxy Saint), and an innocent newbie named Jessy (Jennifer Holland), a Christian fresh off the farm, seeking to earn enough cash to pay for an operation for her grandmother.  When the zombified clientele gets loose, Essko arms his staff.  Eventually the army gets on the trail, and raids the establishment with chaotic results, as the violence reaches extreme levels, featuring outrageous gore, and some pretty radical special effects.Zombie Strippers features cartoonish violence, gory kills, lots of blood, crushed skulls, and half-naked zombies engaging in some radical dance numbers, in between infecting the club's mesmerized patrons.  The zombie makeup gets more extreme as Jenna Jameson and Whitney Anderson evolve into rival creatures who do battle on the dance stage.  Jameson's character even goes on the attack with vaginal launched projectiles.For zombie fans that are also Prime members, Dead Snow (2009), Brain Dead (2007), and Aaah! Zombies (2007) are among the current offerings that might be worth your time.",1336780800,2012-05-12

3.0,"My children have been fans of the Dr Who reboot since the very first Ecclestone episode ""Rose."" The first episode of the Matt Smith Doctor was a brilliant tour-de-force, far superior to Russell T Davis' transition from Ecclestone to Tennant. But... Moffat seems unable to perform the job RTD performed. Each episode feels rushed. The Doctor is invariably manic, the action races by, and... we don't really care. The emotional depth that was present with the two previous incarnations has been abandoned in favor of a more cartoon-like approach that frankly doesn't live up to the standard we hope for with this iconic show. The latest episode Cold War was closer to the spoof alien movie Paul than to anything worthy of the Doctor's imprimature. At one point I almost expected the Ice Warrior to offer Clara a splif - it was really that bad. It's instructive to re-watch the earlier series, especially Series One and Series Three, to see what this show is capable of becoming at its best. At its worst it's nearly a parody of itself, which is a very unwelcome echo of the old days, the end-game of which was cancelation due to audience fatigue. It may be time for the BBC to recognize that while Moffat was capable of creating some very superior individual episodes under RTD's reign as show-runner, he's apparently not capable of handling responsibility for maintaining quality across an entire series. And while it was brave to assign the role of Doctor to such a young actor, it may be time for Smith to pass the baton to someone with greater dramatic range. All in all, this feels like dog days for the Doctor.",1365984000,2013-04-15

The dialogue, the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting, locations and cinematography and characters are top of the line. The staging is staggering in the first six seasons; the quality control falls off in some episodes later on. Perhaps because you get used to an exquisite product watching the first six seasons. Agatha Christie would be proud; maybe intimidated by the way her stories have been brought to life.  Every detail is spared no expense and continuity is unmatched. I can watch these over and over in spite of the fact that I know the ending and who the villain is. If you have never see a Poirot episode it&#8217;s well worth your time to watch. John Strickland is an excellent director and Suchet, and cast is top notch.

This is the story of a comparative Rome from both ends of the social spectrum; Julius Caesar as he rises to dictator and defeats Pompeii miserably, graphically and definitely vindictively. Mark Antony rises to power as well, the spoiled underling of Caesar whose desire for power in every form is graphic throughout the first season. In contrast, the life of a simple soldier, Lucius Verena and his sidekick Titus Pullo live complicated lives in Rome as they try to return to civilian life after the Gallic Wars.

5.0,"Judging from the pilot, the chemistry of the ensemble characters and the potentially huge and intriguing mystery leaves me to believe that this could be a great TV series. I am going to admit right off the bat that what brought me to watch this in the first place is because Chris Carter (creator of X-Files) made this show and that may have biased me in some way. But, that's just what brought me to the door. The actor's interactions and the central mystery is what is going to bring to episode two. There was some impressive special effects and immensity in this pilot, although kind of tame compared to other great action/sci fi/fantasy series, but this is only a pilot. There are also some problems with this pilot as well (which I will be honest enough to admit since I want this to be picked up to series) including some of the expositional and stereotypical dialogue from the actors, especially by the character &#34;D&#34;, who I know as an actor is capable of a lot more. Also, the look and feel was a bit off. It's look didn't match it's story and the seriousness it should have. It kind of looked like a Syfy Channel show, with a potentially AMC TV series story premise. It's needs a darker and grittier style of filmmaking...shoot on film! Now, I don't want to compare this to The Walking Dead, but I will compare it but only for the reasons that I saw a lot of the strengths of ensemble acting, set-up of a long-form story, and great size and scale that I saw in the pilot for TWD.  Overall, I want to see more!",1391644800,2014-02-06
2.0,"He's a video voyeur, she's deceitful, he's a 3rd wheel and together they're....unsympathetic.  He's arrogant, she's snotty, he's a tool and together they're... obnoxious.

4.0,"I watched all available seasons of Being Human (the UK show) - available on Amazon Prime, by the way - and enjoyed them all.  The premise of the show is beyond credibility (ghost, vampire, and werewolf roommates), but the episodes are interesting nonetheless.  Each episode is wrapped around several storylines (typically, one for each of the primary characters) and how they intersect (or not, in some cases).  Most are resolved within the episode, but there is some carryover (i.e., hanging suspense that requires viewing the next episode).  I believe this show is still on the air.  If you watched the British series, you will see quite a lot of similarities (some duplicate storylines).  There are quite a few differences though, including storylines that do differ.  Some basic premises change - such as vampires being visible by camera - which eliminate a number of the British storylines from consideration.  Good, semi-mindless viewing.",1393027200,2014-02-22

5.0,"I have known women who stripped and most of them drift into drugs and prostitution.  some don't , in this case we had a girl ready to please  her husband , who was abusive to a degree.  Of course drugs come into the picture and as in most lives that spells a downward fall.  The acting in this one is excellent ,  this is a engaging film filled with tons of great songs in the background. many of them are by black artists. when hearing this it reminded me how far black artists have fallen today.  rap  crap music and hip slop hop?  man they were good back the seventies though.  anyways , the film does a good job of telling her story. I would say that if she had just stuck with porn and didn't do dope , it would have been a happier situation for her.  Of course she did clean up her life and move on , only to die in a car accident in Denver , in the 00's.  But this is a good mostly true story and that's good enough.  it's not a great movie but it's a honest movie in feel and texture. of course most women should avoid the porn industry, some might like it though and if they are not on dope they will not spiral downward. this is worth catching.",1387065600,2013-12-15

On February 16, 2012, Syfy announced that the show's fifth and final season would premiere on April 16, 2012.

3.0,"In Monsters, we take up the story 6 years after a NASA spacecraft has crash-landed in northern Mexico.  ""Something"" on the craft has infected the local vegetation, and it morphs, somehow, into an organic ""terrestrial octopus,"" about 3 stories high.These things really come out at night (do they hide in the water during the day?) and attack people for some reason (do they eat them?  the ""monsters"" certainly need more food than this).It seems like most of the ""damage"" attributed to these creatures is collateral damage caused by airstrikes and chemical attacks (you get a sense of this is the first 2 minutes).The story follows a news photographer (Scoot McNairy) who is given the assignment of getting the daughter (Whitney Able) of his employer out of Mexico (the quarantine zone is expanding).  You never find out what the daughter is doing there, but, surprise!  They miss the last ferry, and have to hoof it out (why the publisher father doesn't send a jet down is undetermined).The movie really is about the social and sexual tension between these two.  The ""monsters"" are really a minor part of the story, although they are the background for the plot.  Now, this doesn't bother me too much, because I'm not a horror film fan.  I was more interested in the sci-fi dimensions.McNairy is a very believable photographer.  Able comes across as naive and needy.  The trip to the US border is eventful, with the viewer constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.  But will it?The gigantic barrier at the US border seems more appropriate for Jurassic Park than for this movie, except it has no gate where the road cuts through.  Weird.Fundamentally, this human story, and the alien angle, weren't the best match.  I don't regret the time I spent watching it, but I think there was more potential here.",1299369600,2011-03-06

4.0,"Although I can&#8217;t remember a Chiller movie I couldn&#8217;t stand, their entertainment value and production qualities do vary. I always try to go into a film without any sort of pre-conceived notions, but let&#8217;s be honest. That&#8217;s nearly impossible to do once you&#8217;ve read any type of publicity material on a movie. I was carefully optimistic as I placed the Scream Factory&#8217;s Blu-ray release of &#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw&#8221; in my player and sat down to review it.As many of you may know, &#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw&#8221; is an updated version of W.W. Jacobs&#8217; supernatural short story from 1902. Three wishes are granted to the owner of the title object. Unfortunately, the wishes come with a terrible price.Director Brett Simmons and Writer Macon Blair did a great job of establishing a group of engaging personalities through quick character development. It's a simple and entertaining tale that keeps your attention as it plays out. The solid camerawork for this independent genre piece also came as a surprise.&#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw&#8221; boasts an ensemble cast of stars to help draw in their individual fans. Some of them fully committed to the movie, while others appear to have been paid as much as the budget would allow to get them for a day&#8217;s work for name recognition. Charles S. Dutton plays a detective who pops up a few times before making his dramatic exit. He might be in the movie for a sum total of ten minutes at the most.Corbin Bleu continues to shake his Disney stigma by taking on a more mature role for &#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw.&#8221; He plays a blue-collar factory worker named Catfish. It&#8217;s much different than his roles in &#8220;High School Musical&#8221; and &#8220;Free Style.&#8221; He also looks like he&#8217;s bulked up a bit over the years. This isn&#8217;t Bleu&#8217;s first genre film, as he was also in &#8220;Nurse 3D&#8221; and &#8220;Scary or Die.&#8221;&#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw&#8221; was given a 1080p high-definition transfer and is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. The video quality is clear, clean, and easy on the eyes. 5.1 surround sound puts the viewer right in the thick of the action. There are no recognizable issues with either the video or audio transfer of the movie.Scream Factory included a minimum amount of bonus material for &#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw.&#8221; Audio commentary is provided by Director Brett Simmons, Cinematographer Scott Winig, and Actor C.J. Thomason. The featurette &#8220;Making &#8216;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw&#8217;&#8221; includes interviews with the cast and filmmakers. A trailer for the movie is found as well.&#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw&#8221; is unrated, although I would consider it PG-13. You won&#8217;t find anything out of the ordinary for supernatural horror films. There&#8217;s some violence, gore, adult situations, and language. The one thing we don&#8217;t get surprisingly is any nudity.If you like supernatural thrillers, &#8220;The Monkey&#8217;s Paw&#8221; will provide some entertainment for horror hounds looking for an old-fashioned tale in a new package. Some might find vague comparisons to &#8220;Pet Semetary&#8221; are in order. I found it to be satisfying and was pleased by its overall quality and level of suspense.",1405468800,2014-07-16

3.0,"First, I love Veronica Mars. Cleverly written, generally well acted, good production values. Not to mention that Kristen Bell is a little doll! I would rank the first two seasons among my top 10-15 all time favorite shows. It started out strong in season 3 as well, but then began fading. By this time, several interesting characters were gone- Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter)and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin)most important among them. Another problem with the third season is that there were too many threads left hanging and unexplained subplots, perhaps to have been picked up in the 4th season, which never materialized. I suspect that late in the 3rd season, cast, crew, and writers knew they were not to be picked up for another season, and everything started going downhill. If you haven't seen this series, you may be able to find some episodes online to see if you like it. I was poking around free TV sites (legal sites, paid for by advertising, of course)when I first found this series. But then if you do like it, I would say the first two seasons are probably a buy, but could only marginally recommend the 3rd season.",1312934400,2011-08-10

Throw in a generous bunch of victims and perps, both repulsive and sympathetic, and you get an excellent drama that will satisfy all your voyeuristic needs. Good writing plus good acting plus good production values create a memorable series.

5.0,"The idea of meeting your own doppelg&auml;nger or clone has been explored in movies many times before, one of the most current being the excellent thriller ""Enemy"" from earlier this year. But that's certainly not the first time that the concept has been delved into with some of the more popular examples being 1988's ""Dead Ringers"" and the Oscar-winning ""Adaptation"" from 2002. Each film that has touched on the subject manages to be completely different from one another, and they all seem to have their own agendas. But a new flick that may be a bit harder to figure out is Richard Ayoade's darkly-funny ""The Double"".Set in what appears to be the near future, it follows a lonely government clerk named Simon (Jesse Eisenberg) whose unpleasant life is made worse by the arrival of a new co-worker who is both his exact physical double and his opposite in personality. Much more confident and charismatic, he begins to take advantage of Simon and slowly take control of his life.With an astounding performance from Eisenberg playing both of the contrasting characters (his scenes primarily consisting of lengthy monologues) the film has a sort of Hitchcockian feel to it. The cinematography is breathtaking and its style is well-refined making it easy to get yourself lost in it. Plus, due to the great supporting cast - Craig Roberts, Chris O'Dowd, and Wallace Shawn - it succeeds in providing subtly comic moments throughout.Challenging your perception of other people and making you think deeply about what makes you unique, it's an absorbing and ultimately satisfying movie experience. It may not be for everyone, but I found ""The Double"" to be a nice surprise and a break from the normal.",1402272000,2014-06-09

3.0,"Who says an indi-film can't be a run of the mill soap opera?  That's pretty much what we get here in this brief (85 minutes) look at sexual desires, infidelity and questionable morality.  The best thing director/writer Ry Russo-Young (""You Won't Miss Me"") has going for her is the cast.John Krasinski stars as Peter, a Hollywood sound technician who is married to Julie (Rosemarie DeWitt), a therapist.  Julie has a teenage daughter (India Ennenga) who has a crush on her step-dad's assistant (Justin Kirk).  A twenty- something documentarian named Martine (Olivia Thirlby) shows up to get some help with special effects and sound for her film about bugs.Martine is a friend of a friend and once Peter first meets Martine, everybody's hormones kick into high gear.  Like all good soaps we've got the hunky ex-hubby (Dylan McDermott) coming around for dinner.  We've got Julie accepting flirtatious advances from a patient.  The daughter has her eyes on the assistant and the assistant is goo-goo for Martine and Martine for Peter.  Whew!While there is at least one scene of a sexual nature, nothing is overly graphic and little skin is ever shown.  The script is OK and while I was buying all the coy looks for a while it just started to get a bit silly.  While the film has its moments, it will likely be forgotten pretty quickly.",1354665600,2012-12-05

4.0,"&#34;Pompeii&#34; came and went in theaters while not making much of a splash along the way. Many blame the release of &#34;The Lego Movie&#34; at the same time for this misfortune. Others blame it on poor word-of-mouth and a lack of interest in the subject matter. Either way, it's arrived on Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Download guarantees many will give it a second chance in the comfort of their own homes.On the eve of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a slave named Milo (Kit Harington) is brought to the great city of Pompeii to participate in the gladiatorial arena. Upon his arrival, he catches the eye of the daughter (Emily Browning) of the city's ruler (Jarred Harris). As the arena battles rage on, the towering volcano begins spewing molten lava and raining fiery rock onto the citizens of the ancient metropolis. In the midst of all the confusion and destruction, Milo escapes and finds himself leading the ruler's daughter to safety as the city crumbles around them.First off, if you're walking into &#34;Pompeii&#34; expecting complete historical accuracy you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Keep in mind that it is a Hollywood film. Although Director Paul W.S. Anderson went to great lengths to make the eruption of the volcano and the layout of Pompeii as authentic as possible, he himself even admits that the story and other scientific elements aren't completely precise.What Anderson and Writers Janet Scott Batchler, Lee Batchler, and Michael Robert Johnson do is build up a few characters the best they can in a movie with a running time of an hour and forty-four minutes. If this were an old-school 1970's disaster film, they would've made it over two hours long and spent the first hour and a half getting the audience acquainted and invested in all the lives of the people seen onscreen. In a world where there has to be an explosion every four to five minutes or viewers lose interest, that's just not possible.The cast of &#34;Pompeii&#34; seems legitimately interested in participating in the movie. Leads Kit Harington and Emily Browning both fit their roles of star-crossed lovers quite well as they gaze into each other's eyes from afar and Harington risks life and limb to save Browning from certain doom. Kiefer Sutherland chews the scenery every chance he gets as the deplorable Roman Senator Corvus.All the explosions and fiery destruction is beautifully enhanced by a high-definition transfer for &#34;Pompeii's&#34; Blu-ray release. The surround sound puts the viewer in the middle of all the mayhem, leaving little to the imagination as earthquakes rumble loudly and flaming boulders scream through the sky before crashing into the city. Movies like this are what home theaters were made for.The Blu-ray for &#34;Pompeii&#34; is packed full of bonus material that will educate viewers on what went on behind the scenes of the film. Filmmakers provide commentary for the feature. Six featurettes focus on the special effects, cast and characters, stunts, production and costume design, and a historical view of the last days of Pompeii. Deleted and alternate scenes are included as well.&#34;Pompeii&#34; is rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences, disaster-related action, and brief sexual content. Plenty of people die horrible deaths in the movie for all to see. Some die bloody deaths as gladiators while others perish from being buried in volcanic debris. The &#34;brief sexual content&#34; refers to scenes of women shopping for slaves to have their ways with them and some passionate kissing between characters.As a fan of disaster films, &#34;Pompeii&#34; successfully met my expectations. It's not often you can find a way to blend together the destructive elements of &#34;Armageddon,&#34; &#34;The Poseidon Adventure,&#34; &#34;Earthquake,&#34; and &#34;The Day After Tomorrow&#34; into one movie. When you add a hefty spoonful of &#34;Gladiator&#34; to the concoction, there's not much more you can do to satisfy the hunger of action movie fans anywhere.",1402876800,2014-06-16
5.0,"John Cleese is possibly the funniest man on the planet. His writing is funny, his way of speaking is funny, his movements are funny. There is an awful angularity to him, he bends at all the wrong places, his knees are up too high. To watch him try to open a bottle of wine is to watch an exercise in uncoordination that is funnier than the entire output of every stand up comic since the Greek guy with the rocks in his mouth. And the situations and dialogue he created, because it was Cleese who wrote the scripts for Fawlty Towers, are even better.Basil Fawlty is wonderful to watch. He is craven and bullying at the same time, a pompous suck up, utterly incompetent, a blowhard who blames his shortcomings and failures on the world. Cleese has the character down pat...that supercillious little git of a hotel manager or railway station clerk, the middle manager who is in over his head, with steam coming out of his ears, convinced that the world is out to get him.  In real life, they're horrible. When they are running Fawlty Towers, they are a thing of wonder to behold.Basil's wife is beautifully underplayed by the incomparable Prunella Scales. Sybil Fawlty is a woman inured to Basil's tantrums, shenanegans and schemes. She tells him what to do, then spends the rest of her time on the phone, saying ""I knoooooow"" and ""Reeeeeee-alllllly"" to her friend at the other end of the line. She gets more humor out of those phone responses than most TV sitcom characters can get out of an entire script. Basil cannot, will not, do what this sensible little person says.  When Basil looks at Sybil with his gimlet eye and mumbles ""Coiffed Shrub,"" if you don't fall out of your chair and drop to the floor, convulsed with laughter, you must be Swiss.No offense.Connie Booth, who is American, was married to Cleese and co-wrote the show with him. Booth has a smaller role as the hotel chambermaid...and the voice of reason who plucks Basil from the edge of the abyss only to find he knows another route.Even if you are from the Bunderstadt, you will have to laugh at Manuel, the Barcelonian waiter (played by Andrew Sachs). Manuel's blank and totally mindless stare, his utter lack of comprehension as Basil--hair sticking out above his temples, sweat on his upper lip, eyes blazing with rage and madness, body bent in some impossible configuration that has his torso and hips and knees zigzagging away from one another at impossible angles--tries to get him to perform the simplest task, must surely cripple you with laughter.No offense.If you are among the six people on the Earth who have not seen Fawlty Towers, drop what you are doing and watch.  The show ran so briefly, there are very few episodes, but they never get old and never get stale.  Even so, in a perfect world, George Bush would not have invaded Afghanistan. He would have sent our troops to London to get hold of Cleese and force him to write one more season.  At least he would have found one good use for his waterboarding.No offense.",1347408000,2012-09-12

5.0,"I was skeptical when I first heard about this series.  I am a fan of the original movies (even Manhunter) and didn't think this would be a very good interpretation.  Wow, was I wrong.  The cast is incredibly strong (Mads Mikkelsen is charming, sympathetic, and yet terrifying at the same time) and the atmosphere of this series is unnerving, but in a great way.  It doesn't flinch too much from the subject matter and it is far more graphic when it comes to the deaths, then I imagined it could be.It it well worth your time, especially if you are tired of the usual procedural television.",1395187200,2014-03-19

The show could use more energy--and yes, I get that it's the tail end of a heatwave and everyone's worn out, but still, the whole episode felt somewhat lethargic.  The show could also use more visual flare.Nonetheless, there storytelling, acting and directing here are light years above and beyond the pathetic and mean-spirited crap that Disney cranks out.This show has soul and charm to spare.

He can't figure out to car pool with someone, take the bus, or get a bike?  Give me a break.  I've worked lots of jobs.  I haven't seen lots of people who work real hard, but don't get recognized.

5.0,"Even though I was completely satisfied with the finale of Season 1 Under the Dome; based on its initial premise I figured that was The End of the series. Now it seems there is some 'fleshing' out of the original show that appears interesting enough; hopefully, the production will continue to raise my inquisitiveness  enough. I haven't read the book, so I can't really compare continuity. I find it is worth while to check out the written page after watching the series, at times. For a 'made for tv' serial; this one is worth trying. Check out Series 1 first if you haven't already.",1405036800,2014-07-11

There's many twists and turns as the season goes on. This last season certainly doesn't disappoint and it's probably the best next to season 1. The season was packed with action and drama. The series finale was one of the more satisfying ones to any show. The only thing that bugged me a little was the very end but I can't really say it didn't work.

3.0,"Pilot of the new Ironside has a new few twist to an old formula. Blair Underwood brings a nuance performance to the lead role. His cast of characters are good in their supporting roles. But overall their is nothing earth shattering or ground breaking about this series. With AMC, Netflix, HBO and Showtime raising the bar by challenging the audience it's become harder for network TV to compete.It's not impossible, CBS does a really good job with The Good Wife, Law and Order SVU does some risky things, and there are other shows out there ie The Vampire Diaries, Fringe, and The Following that while not my taste seem to have a large following. Ironside may be able to capture some of these people in the latter group. But unless is a slow night I think I'll take a pass-though I wish Underwood and the new crew the best of luck.",1380067200,2013-09-25
5.0,"This has been one of my favorite shows since it's inception but the ending of the last season left all of us fans in a bit of a shock.  I can hardly wait to see where it goes from here, the picture looks to be a much darker Nick than we have been seeing.  This promo about Monroe and Rosalee is great, the two of them add depth to the show that it would not have otherwise. I have to say I am NOT the biggest fan of Juliette but maybe they can change my mind this season, I was tired of seeing her last season since she did not seem to add much to the show.UPDATE:  Watched the first episode and still don't think Juliette adds much to this show but they are going to keep trying it seems :)UPDATE:  9 Nov - Tell me they are not going to mess with the basic plotline and make this more ""non-violent"" the basic plot for this show has already been set but it seem they want to screw with it.  I subscribe to the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" in regards to this program.UPDATE:  6 Apr 14 - Since I don't want to do any spoilers, I can say this season has exceeded my expectations and this last episode has blown the doors off of anything I could have predicted, well done it seems.",1381190400,2013-10-08
5.0,"I was in Rome in December of 2007.  It was an amazing experience.  This is one of the reasons I so much enjoy this series.  It is not filmed on sets designed to look like Rome.  The city itself is one of the major characters.  I love seeing the camera pan by some of the places I visited.  I love seeing the city as it is, horrible graffiti and all.  I think the whole look of the program is just way above some of the other detective programs out there.  Although corruption and subterfuge are major plot points, the mood of each show is not dark and grim. The acting is superb.  I've always enjoyed Rufus Sewell's acting.  I'm not familiar with the Italian actress who plays Tania, but she's done a great job.  I like the fact that they're not beating you over the head with the romance.  These are mature adults, not young twenty-somethings trying to steal a moment in a storage room at work.  I also find it interesting that Zen, who is the ""hero,"" lives with his mother.  Normally, that's a red flag.  But Rufus Sewell makes it OK. I also like the music.  I was so disappointed that the BBC decided to cancel the series and not make any more.  Imagine how overjoyed I was to find that Amazon put it on Prime Instant Videos for free for Prime members.  Now I can watch it on a lazy weekend whenever I want.  It's kind of like me and Star Wars.  Yeah, I've seen it a thousand times.  Yeah, I pretty much know every line.  Yeah, I absolutely know how it's going to end.  But, I still like watching it anyway and it never gets old.",1351296000,2012-10-27

Now in season 2, the story with Rusty continues to warm my heart and Sharon continues to demonstrate how a woman can be strong, moral and smart.

2.0,"There is a lot going on in the heavily stylized three part British miniseries ""Blackout"" and I don't always mean that as a compliment.  I was drawn to this presentation due to the involvement of Christopher Eccleston, an actor that I almost always find fascinating to watch.  While he gives a largely successful performance, the actual adaptation is overwrought and even borders on preposterous.  It may seem like an unusual feat to make something that is simultaneously over-simplified and over-complicated, but that's just what ""Blackout"" has done.  As a study of addiction, of infidelity, and of political machinations, ""Blackout"" is a show that had a lot of interesting themes to work with.  But nothing is explored in any real detail or depth, so there isn't much with which to emotionally connect.  And it doesn't help that the political side story is just plain silly!  To compensate for some of the plot's shortcomings, the show is fashioned as a quick-edited and jarring nightmare that leaps around in time.  While this disorientation might be a good approach in an addiction drama, it doesn't disguise the implausibility within the narrative structure of the program.Eccleston plays an alcoholic City Councilman who is caught up in corruption with a local builder.  After an intense confrontation kicks off Episode One, Eccleston awakes with only a vague memory of the previous night's events.  However, something seems amiss as he's covered in blood and the nefarious builder is in the hospital.  We see the scene repeatedly in short staccato bursts of memory, but can Eccleston piece together what happened and stay out of trouble?  A young woman. presumably a prostitute, was also on hand and her involvement with Eccleston is something that the viewer has to decipher with time.  As Eccleston's world seems to be crumbling, an unexpected act of violence brands him a national hero.  And this deeply flawed man has a chance to ascend to power.  Is this a time for cover-up or is it a time for redemption?  While this twist literally made me laugh out loud, I never believed it for a moment.While loud and over-produced, I did enjoy the set-up of ""Blackout.""  And the ridiculous twist was mightily entertaining. But I had a couple of major issues with the remainder of this three-parter.  The mystery is never particularly compelling, and the political power Eccleston wields never rings true.  Originally set up as a puppet leader, he grows more resistant and altruistic.  SLIGHT SPOILER:  As the show needs to come to an end, in one miraculously scene, he ends contract corruption once and for all within the city!  Easy as this, one man made a decision in one night and revolutionized the entire city government!  That's how things work, right?  END SLIGHT SPOILER.  In the end, I just didn't think ""Blackout"" was smart enough to work as a great political thriller but it also lacked the humor necessary to make it a pleasing potboiler.  An exercise in style over substance, you will have to overlook a lot in the plotting of ""Blackout"" to get much enjoyment out of the rather dour affair.  KGHarris, 12/12.",1356220800,2012-12-23

5.0,"After watching four seasons of ""The Office"", what I was consistently amazed at was the show's ability to stray away from the formula in order to cultivate new territory. For example, during a large portion of the third season Jim and Pam (the emotional backbone of the show) are separated and lose that incredible chemistry. However, that separation ends up bringing in the Andy Bernard character, who has been a wonderful addition to the show.This fifth season did much of the same. It started off great, especially when Michael Scott finds a new employee, Holly, who catch match him step for step in the craziness department. Each episode contains at least one absolutely hilarious moment (and some come once every few seconds!), even despite the fact that the ""same old"" cast is back again. However, as the seasons approaches roughly the 2/3rds mark, there are some major changes that take place, primarily for Michael and Pam Beasley. This creates a run of 5-6 episodes that, to be honest, just aren't as hilariously funny as the rest of them (as Jim Halpert's character cannot hold the show in lieu of Michael).However, as they so often do, the writers take that disturbing change and eventually make it work out for the better, as the emotional sides of many of ""The Office"" workers are touched on more than ever before, what with all the changes occurring. When the show finally gets back to its original pattern/format, it feels like slipping into that old familiar spot on the couch again...you might take it for granted while you have it, but removing it from your life will just want it back that much more!Thus, I once again give this season of ""The Office"" my highest approval for its ability to be incredibly funny and still develop characters in a meaningful way.",1263340800,2010-01-13
4.0,"this reminded me of old time horror flicks. The fact that much of the film wasn't in English actually added to the spook factor for me.

Here comes along an independent film that I've never heard of, I take a little risk and rent it, and then...WOW. Creepy, smart, great twist at the end that really caught me by surprise.This film is a MUST for any fan of the Horror / Supernatural genre.P.SI bought it on DVD because real liked it ..just wish they release it on blu-ray & widscreen format,This movie is great! i dont understand why people are talking about how they are speaking polish and there is no subtitles...

5.0,"Season four is quite possibly my favorite season, although season one comes in pretty close behind. Gus seems to find his own place this season, and Shawn has a nice thing going on at the beginning and end of the season (as usual). The first episode, ""Extradition: British Columbia"" is hilareous: Shawn takes Gus on the road to Canada, where he passes himself off as Santa Barbara's head detective and Lassiter & Juliet have to play second fiddle. Then we find out the whole reason he went to Canada: it was originally a trip he had planned for Abigail. I had to watch the episode again, because suddenly a lot of the scenes took on whole new meanings.I also enjoyed ""A Very Juliet"" episode - very touching, even if it does pull Juliet and Shawn apart a bit. Perhaps that's why in Season five he sends a picture of a dog to all of Juliet's boyfriends with a message ""this is you"". Ah, the on again-off again relationship between the two.If you enjoy the series, this is another one to add.",1280620800,2010-08-01
3.0,"It's like it was made by 2 partners.  One partner is somewhat tech-savvy and in their 20's.  The other partner would be someone in their 30's - 40's that remembers nerds/geeks/technology from movies and TV shows in the 90's/2000's and want to replicate it.  I say partners because it seems ideas from both make it into the show.  This shows in the office where an unnecessary wimpy character who COULD be wearing noise-cancelling headphones is bothered by slight noise from his coworkers.  Of course, things are covered in Cheetos.  This character is almost completely unlikeable until he makes a joke near the end.It does seem like another attempt at a TV programmer trying to jump on the (not really a) trend of shows about startups in Silicon Valley.  It's not a bad thing, but they're half-assing it after watching The Social Network and The Big Bang Theory.",1369785600,2013-05-29

With all of the terrible stuff on broadcast US networks, so many of us are eager to watch political dramas in any era.The Fifties provides a rich setting, and as we look back we see things have not since changed much.Given all the different ways there are to distribute material, is there no other way to make a third season?  Or at least a two hour wrap up of all the loose threads......much the way Veronica Mars crowd sourced a movie based on the beloved cult hit.Perhaps Amazon should revisit this series as they turn to original program production.What.

5.0,"(do not read if you have not watched the first part - last episode)Now we know that the Doctor has something big coming up. A bullet - or a beam - from something, and the things in the shadows to boot. You cannot recall them and yet one was there, and it told Amy Pond she would reveal them. Then there was the odd place that River and Rory went, underneath the secret streets. as The Doctor says, this is not fighting an invasion because it was already here. it is creating a revolution. With Richard Nixon and his sidekick in tow, it seems that things have gone bad and the others are being hunted while the Doctor has a bad time. you know the doctor, however, and how good he is.This episode wraps up a first piece and explains what the enemy well be. I do not want to say so I will omit it, but I did not expect the name. I also did not expect the man and his love and Nixon and the kid, and I did not expect Amy and the revelation she had. I think she has something big coming and people have yet to notice.The acting is great here. Matt Smith has settled into the doctor and has his guy down pat. It makes me laugh, he has such an energetic humor, and I like that. I also liked the dark here and I thought they had plenty of it. The not seeing and not knowing, the marks on the arms; it added in and made a horror.The VOD is great here, too, and added together it well gets its 5/5. Thank you.",1304380800,2011-05-03
5.0,"4.5895 starsI'm surprised by the tepid reception this got, but their loss! I howled with laughter many many times during this incredibly droll film, especially at the Kline scenes. The guy has never been funnier, except maybe in Wanda. This kind of humor is probably waaay too dry for many, but if you like Wes Anderson or Jared Hess or any other off-beat, smart new writer/director, there's something for you here.I'd go so far as to compare this to Withnail And I and Death At A Funeral (the original) for its sustained yet muffled hilarity, and those are two of the funniest modern movies I know. Not all of The Extra Man is great, but most of it is, if your mind is open and your funny bone doesn't mind being tickled from various obtuse angles. I laughed more during this film than most any movie I've seen in a year or two, but then I like it dry, and this is that, to be sure.Ames' characters are both endearing and frustrating, and ring true in all their satiric excesses. I liked everyone in this, and even Reilly's campy voicework somehow fits in, particularly in the beach scene. The cross-dressing might be a little weird for some, but then weird can lead to some very unique laughs, and the scene with the Spankologist has a gorgeous moment: watch her face after their first kiss. It glows in joy and memories of much younger days and it's actually very touching, made even better by being subtle and brief.There's a lot of heart in this film, and I'm surprised more folks didn't feel it. I sure did, and think it's a minor masterpiece in its own way, especially if you know enough older people to enjoy the sly wit Ames and Pulcini/Berman share with us. I also thought the direction was pleasantly quiet and unshowy, but set up the best lines very nicely time and again. Plus, some of the scenes have something very warm and genuine about them, a real rarity in any film.Maybe I'm nuts, but I loved almost everything about The Extra Man, and think that time will treat it very kindly. It's one of a kind, and Kevin Kline shows why he's one of the great comic actors still working, classic on the level of Peter Sellers.If you don't mind a little pathos with your comedy, and like your laughs both broad and edgy, you might just find this to be a gem.",1294185600,2011-01-05

5.0,"Remember when you were a kid, and something came on the tube that looked an awful lot like it was going to feature women behind bars?  It looked like it was going to be filled with every sequence of catfight after catfight, ladies going at it (for their dear lives!)?  They&#8217;d be scratching, pulling hair, kicking, punching away at one another inside of ninety minutes, and you knew &#8211; without a doubt &#8211; that only the strong would survive?  Remember how &#8211; when the trailer ended &#8211; mom and dad made you turn the channel or (worse!) simply turn the TV off because they didn&#8217;t want you watching that &#8220;garbage&#8221;?  Oh, come on, you pleaded with them, just let me watch the first fight, and then you&#8217;ll turn it off, but they still refused, telling you that there were much better things you could do with your time under their roof, in that city, on this Earth?RAZE is the film you want to watch to make up for missing the other.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the box art: &#8220;After she is drugged and abducted, Jamie awakens to find herself in a concrete bunker where she meets fellow abductee Sabrina.  Before long the two women discover that they are in a modern-day coliseum, where they and 48 other women have been selected to fight to the death in order to save both themselves and their loved ones.  Co-starring genre favorites Doug Jones and Sherilyn Fenn, director Josh C. Waller&#8217;s RAZE is a no-holds-barred assault on the senses featuring some of the most brutal combat action ever put on film.  In this contest, may the best woman win.&#8221;Confession time: I&#8217;d seen a preview for RAZE either late last year or earlier this year.  I honestly don&#8217;t remember which.  Meh, the time isn&#8217;t important.  Anyway, I&#8217;d long ago tired out on the whole idea of taking previews seriously.  I&#8217;d been burned by so many great theatrical trailers down through the years, that &#8211; probably ten years back &#8211; I said &#8220;no more,&#8221; and I stopped getting excited about the promised features.  After all, they never live up to the hype.This trailer was a bit different.  It struck a chord.  It rang a bell.  It promised Zoe Bell in a leading role, and, for those of you who wouldn&#8217;t know her face, you&#8217;ve probably seen her work.  She&#8217;s a wonderfully talented stunt woman from New Zealand.  During XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS?  When Xena was doing something particular bad-ass?  That wasn&#8217;t really Lucy Lawless you watched.  Odds are, it was Zoe Bell.  If you don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s the cat&#8217;s meow like I do, then I encourage you to check out her &#8216;stunts&#8217; profile on IMDB.com.  Bell&#8217;s the real deal &#8211; the kind of girl every fanboy wants to take home to meet mom &#8216;cause he knows she might not be good enough for him but she&#8217;ll definitely go down fighting for him.So I saw that trailer, and &#8211; with guarded optimism &#8211; I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get your hopes up.  Don&#8217;t overthink it.  Don&#8217;t hold your breath.&#8221;  Like I told you, I&#8217;d learned my lesson.  I&#8217;d been let down before.  I didn&#8217;t want to be let down again.  Somewhere in the back of my mind, I heard a little bird whisper, &#8220;Zoe won&#8217;t disappoint you.  You&#8217;ll see.&#8221;Well, I just watched RAZE &#8230; and it&#8217;s perfect.In fact, I&#8217;m so smitten with it I hope there&#8217;s a sequel.  And another.  And another.  I hope every film in the history of films yet to be written can take a lesson from its benign simplicity: when it comes to action, don&#8217;t spare the girl.  Why?  Well, here&#8217;s a few good reasons.  Sarah Connor.  Ripley.  Nikita.  Michonne.  Eva Green as Artemisia in 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE.  Angelina Jolie in SALT.  Uma Thurman in KILL BILL.  Milla Jovovich in any of the RESIDENT EVIL picks.  And Michelle Yeoh in just about anything she&#8217;s done.The more of them, the happier we fanboys are.Plus, it&#8217;ll only get Zoe Bell more work.RAZE (2013) is produced by Cinipix, Cosmic Toast Studios, and Quincy Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group under the IFC Midnight label.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly made flick, ponying up some deliciously delirious sights and sounds to anyone who&#8217;s willing to sit for it.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then &#8211; like with the film &#8211; you&#8217;re in for the time of your life: there&#8217;s a commentary, cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes, extended fight sequences, a gag reel, multiple theatrical trailers, and no doubt a kitchen sink somewhere I missed: a sprawling assortment, which shows that everyone involved knew that fans would most definitely want to know more!  Bravo!HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  I&#8217;m not a fool.  I know that RAZE is not the kind of film that&#8217;ll please everyone.  Nor will my ringing endorsement please others.  However, as a lifelong fan of action films and as a budding aficionado of flicks dabbling in exploitation, I must unabashedly admit to loving every minute of it from start-to-finish.  It&#8217;s a no holds barred bloody knuckle brawl that should be celebrated by those who&#8217;ll love it most, which means telling most high-brow critics to go stuff themselves because they couldn&#8217;t possibly understand why it&#8217;s just so darn good.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me a DVD copy of RAZE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape or form influenced my opinion of it.",1399939200,2014-05-13
3.0,"Pompeii tells the story of a slave-turned-gladiator finds himself trapped in a city being destroyed by a volcano.The biggest issue I  have with the movie is that it isn't sure what exactly it wants to be... It is a gladiator remake, a love story, or a disaster movie.  The visual effects and scenery are well done and the city detail was done very well but  the plot of the movie seems to be a combo remake of Gladiator and Titanic which seems to muddle both stories especially considering we all know the volcano blows up and destroys the whole city and everyone in it.The special effects are done well though especially when it comes to the volcano and the destruction of the city at the end of the movie.The movie is ok to watch with its disaster type situation that makes it interesting enough to entertain you but the generic love story and Roman versus Horseman subplot make this movie lesser than the sum of its parts.",1400544000,2014-05-20

5.0,"In the wasteland that is television and most ""entertainment media"" there are fewer and fewer really shining stars.  We are left with two masterpieces of darkly comedic drama.  Dexter is one and deserves its own review.Breaking Bad is the apex of adrenaline-pumping cliff-hangers, with every real-life adventure possible built in.  It outshines and pales anything else on TV, with the exception of Dexter.Breaking Bad is built on a plausability-factor that works in the real world, if at its most extreme.It laces the most perfect syncronicity into every plot and each and every plot realates to each and every previous as well, no doubt, as all plots to come.I end every episode recovering my breath and uttering ""My God, that was good!""If they were to produce 26, or even 52 episodes per season, it wouldn't be enough.  Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and their wonderful cast tear my heart out, make me furious, and leave me feeling compassion for the most flawed group of characters imaginable with every episode...Though fewer, as the series intensifies, there are also incredible laughs to be found.Breaking Bad is life lived on levels none of us can imagine for ourselves, but know, could happen to any of us with one wrong turn or one cruel twist of fate.Bravo to a true masterpiece of entertainment!  I am in awe of a perfect work in the making.If you have not watched Breaking Bad from the beginning, it is the only place to start.  Buy season one, and just keep going!

4.0,"Actually, given the same old story lines and poor acting that are typical of the genre to the point that they are destroying it, ""V/H/S"" had some interesting sub-stories (my personal favorites were the first and last ones). For me, it was rather difficult to see how the sub-stories tied in to the original premise, but I took it as what one reviewer labeled it: a POV horror anthology. Kind of a ""Creepshow"" for the ""found footage"" generation, if you will. There is still a little life left in the genre; ""V/H/S"" showed some real potential.

My theory is that after years of being out of circulation it's reputation exceeds it's actual artistic worth.  Everything here is aces, though.  Good direction, atmosphere and writing.  The acting is superb with the stolid Robert Mitchum leading the cast.  I particularly liked Steven Keats' gundealer and Richard Jordan's duplicitous fed.  I think we've been spoiled by the high quality of films in this genre with Sidney Lumet's ""Prince of the City"" and Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"".  Recommended without reservation but not as enthusiastically as some.",1243728000,2009-05-31
5.0,"Once more DVD comes to the rescue of a TV series that has turned from so so ratings to solid hit. The series is BONES and there is no better way to watch this than on DVD. Why? Because once you get into the series you'll want to continue on rather than wait for the next episode.Just released is BONES SEASON THREE: TOTALLY DECOMPOSED EDITION. How can it be that this show has been on that long already? For those unfamiliar with the show its time to catch up.Based on the real life of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs, the story revolves around Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel), a forensic specialist who works at the Jeffersonian in Washington, D.C. When the FBI comes calling for assistance in the form of Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), Temperance takes to field work like a pro with an intense interest in each case presented.Along with Temperance, known as Bones to Booth, are a team of equally dedicated professionals at the Institute. Among them are Angela (Michaela Conlin) who specializes in facial and body reconstruction via sketches and computer software, Dr. Jack Hodgins (TJ Thynes) who specializes in organic materials and Dr. Zack Addy (Eric Milligan) who knows more about bones than, well, Bones. Each member of the team adds to a complete whole not only in their expertise but in their character functions as well.For the first two seasons we were allowed to explore the world of the ""squints"", Booth's nickname for the intelligent research team at the Institute. But as the show continued, we watched as Booth came to appreciate each individual in their own way. We also watched the sexual tension between Booth and Bones grow in the most subtle of ways as they worked case after case together.There you have it, the main crux of the series. But it's more than that. It involves cases being solved using clues found only by this team of forensic anthropologists. Each week they discover clues no mere mortal would find with the naked eye. And each week Booth and Bones have the chance to put the guilty behind bars. At the same time we get to watch the interplay between the characters as well.What you have here is a combination of age old detective show combined with the technological side shown in the various CSI series. But rather than focus mainly on the science of evidence we get that as well as interaction between characters in more familiar TV territory. Romance and buddy systems are seen in each episode as opposed to straight police work.This brings us to season three. This time around we begin with Bones acting unlike herself. Could it be because Booth sent her father to prison at the end of last season? Could it be the attraction between Bones and Booth became too much? Or could it be because Zack had decided to take a leave and head out to work in Iraq?  Just as the stories offer clues to the murders, the series offers clues and at times answers to these questions.As the season starts we find Hodgins and Angela still very much in love, still planning on marrying and still searching for the man who was a one night stand Angela married in a drunken stupor. This was an arc left open from season two that finds an answer this year.Zack returns from Iraq a bit different. Fortunately for fans of the series (and Zack) he shows up in the first episode, just in time to save the day and help find the criminal.Bones and Booth start off not nearly as close as before. Whichever of the reasons discussed that seem to have had an effect on Bones is clearly visible from the first minutes of episode one. And as the pair start to work things out, they begin therapy to help with their work.The first show offers a new challenge for viewers and the team as they encounter a secret cannibalistic society that has left their calling card. While the Gormogon killer may not be a familiar name to most, it will be by the end of this season. Not only are the guilty not found by shows end but they continue to show up during the season.A more in depth view of Bones sex life is offered as well (no, not seen) as we begin to meet the men she dates. This seems to upset Booth who does his best to hide it. The affection between these two characters may be more blatant than Scully and Mulder of X FILES but it is still held in check for the present.Humor, mystery, relationships and friendship are all regular topics in each episode of the series. And Season Three brings forth more of the human characteristics of each member of the forensic family found here. It is these human qualities and interaction between characters that makes this show the success that it is. While Bones comes off as cold and out of touch with the world around her, Seely comes off as having lived more than his years would seem. Put these two together and you come up with one of the most successful teams since Nick and Nora Charles.Extended episodes, alternate episodes and more make this box set worth adding to your collection. And if you don't have them already, buy the first two as well.This is a fresh series with great acting that makes the entire production believable. And that is what makes for good TV. And good TV now means good DVDs. Take a 3 day weekend or the holidays to get acquainted with the Bones family. It's a great mystery filled time for all.",1227571200,2008-11-25
4.0,"Well, here's the thing with this show: you already know the ending.  No bigfoot, squatch, yeren, etc. is ever caught by the film crew.  Or wrestled to the ground by the mighty Bobo.Still, the show is pretty darn entertaining.  The value in this show is that it presents all of the encounter stories you could ever want to hear about, presents some pretty intriguing evidence in the form of audio and video recordings, and delves into the little-known wild areas in every U.S. state except Hawaii.  They even go overseas to investigate things like the Yeren in China.So, if you value anecdotal evidence and are willing to accept the fact that not everyone who sees something is a liar or hoaxer, this show is worth watching.  The tales people tell are worth the price of admission.  Something is going on out there in the woods.Not to mention the fact that the hosts are a group of really cool, intelligent, enthusiastic people.  Bobo is my favorite.  He is a giant man with a big heart, a sense of humor, and an unwavering belief in &#34;the Squatch.&#34;  Plus, he is the only one who could possibly protect the team if an angry squatch comes lumbering into the show.Good stuff.

5.0,"WITH GREAT POWER (a/k/a WITH GREAT POWER: THE STAN LEE STORY, 2010, 80 minutes, for Epix Channel) was one enjoyable, fun documentary. It is the story of Stan Lee, born Stanley Lieber, the Brain Behind Marvel Comics. In my estimation, he along with his three trusted artists IS Marvel Comics.Told entirely by Stan himself, in mostly modern interviews and some footage from older appearances, this really covers all bases I wanted to know about him. I have read two forgettable biographies, and saw one other documentary about him - and they were all lousy. Maybe that's just me but this documentary is the one to see, the only one.With great power, as Stan learned early, comes great responsibility. Even in documentaries, perhaps most especially in documentaries. There are important appearances/commentaries here from luminaries such as Nicholas Cage (who calls Stan ""a father figure"") and Patrick Stewart (who, like me, thinks Stan is greater than Shakespeare).I have this rotten feeling I was cheated by the version I watched, because there are lots of credited no-shows, like one of my favorite actors, Thomas Hayden Church and one of my favorite directors, Roger Corman. Can't imagine where these boys got off to - and Nicholas Cage isn't much of an addition to the facts presented here: he gets about a minute of face time and part of that is a filmed spontaneous encounter he has with Stan someplace.More than compensationary are the moments such as Stan sneaking up on Robert Downey who is attending to some adoring fans - he turns, sees Stan and says, ""I'm too famous for YOU!""To which Stan loudly yet sweetly says, ""You're damn right you are!!!"" as he gives Downey a big hug that is fiercely returned. But that's not why I love this documentary. This is a special work, dedicated to Lee's life, accomplishments and his newer endeavors. It does not dwell on the painful (one being the lawsuit over the movies being made and Stan being cut out of the process entirely).Instead, it reminded me of my youth, when Stan's comics were fresh and the world was abuzz with him and his work. In those days, suffice it to say Stan Lee was, for my generation, a little comparable to God. Except we knew if we wrote to Stan, HE just might answer. We knew he existed and we even thought one day we might get to meet him and a few of the artists who drew the comics.The importance of Stan Lee, that causes me and Patrick Stewart to say he is greater than Shakespeare, is not only his writing and other genius - it is his deep understanding of human pain, our pain, his own pain. It is his ability to take pain and spin it into the purest gold there is. This documentary concentrates on that, and may I add it is an invaluable resource to track exactly what (and when) Stan accomplished such great work for this world.It really matters little who you are: you have to get this. If you're expecting Hollywood gab and 'insider' peeks at the Marvel films or Stan's production company works, not much is here. If you just sit and enjoy, I promise it will teach you more than just the meaning of real power.Stan Lee himself will teach you why it is that with great power comes great responsibility, and he'll show you how he made it his life's theme.",1355529600,2012-12-15

5.0,In this show Timothy olyphant shows how we were raised in the south to take of our own business. This show isn't for the kids and it has a little of everything. For the man or woman. Must see,1393027200,2014-02-22
5.0,"I love this show, i hope it will be on for a long time. I like the way they incorporate mondern gadgets with old fashion cayjun ways in their investigations. They always seem to get something stirring!",1369785600,2013-05-29
4.0,"As with most pilots trying to set the stage for where the show is going, it was kind of slow at first. It turned cheezy when the characters realized something happened to the world. But, it began to pick up with a little more character development and then the ending was enough to make me want to see what happens next. This could have the potential for a good series as long they don't have any more scenes of people just meandering around with no sense of urgency or care.",1395273600,2014-03-20
5.0,I'm sorry to see that this will be the final season.  I will surely miss the show and the characters.  You have to see the show from Season One.TammyZ,1375574400,2013-08-04
4.0,"I feel the key thing to remember when thinking about THE ORPHANAGE is that this is a ghost story, not a horror movie.  The idea, the intention, is the creep out the viewer, to give the viewer pleasant chills.  It's the kind of movie that doesn't merely FEAR the afterlife, it accepts that ghosts can have their own motives that are just as worthy as the motives of living folks.THE ORPHANAGE comes from the current revival in the ghost story within Spanish cinema.  Fortunately, we haven't had to endure too many English language remakes (like we did with many of the misguided Americanizations of Japanese films recently).  We get to see the original films, in their original languages, with subtitles.  Although THE OTHERS was remade into English, a terrific film like THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is only viewable in Spanish right now.  That film is simply too steeped in Spanish history to be in any other language.THE ORPHANAGE takes place in a deserted old mansion that some 30 years prior had served as an orphanage.  The main character is returning with her adopted son and her physician husband to reopen the facility into a home for special needs children.  The mood of the movie is one of foreboding right from the start...how could this rundown, dusty old place every be an inviting home for anyone?  Sure enough, right away the young son Simon begins to ""see things"" and he quickly finds new ""imaginary"" friends that make him do things.  There is NOTHING new about this whatsoever, and for awhile, you might suspect you're in a clich&eacute; ridden story.Then comes opening day, when the new children arrive for a sort of welcoming party with their parents...and Simon disappears.  The frantic search of his mother scares off the prospective clients, and for the next bit of the movie, we see the mother's descent into obsession.  She is convinced she can find her son.  Further, she is convinced that some ghosts have taken him.Naturally, her husband doesn't believe her and neither do the police.  At one point, we have a GHOST HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL kind of scene, when a psychic comes to the house with her scientific crew.  (The psychic is played by Geraldine Chaplin...an unusual but effective casting choice.)  This crew kicks things into a higher gear...but they depart and eventually, mom is left on her own to unravel all the secrets she needs.I don't want to reveal much about the plot specifics, because part of the fun of these kinds of movies is figuring out just what the ghosts want and who they are.  The  movie builds to a fairly surprising plot revelation and finally to a bittersweet ending.  It's a combination of SIXTH SENSE, DARK WATER and POLTERGEIST.It's an artfully made film...very atmospheric.  There isn't much unusual about the story, the mood or the technical work...the filmmakers aren't breaking new ground.  But what this films DOES bring is a genuine feeling of sadness and a true glimpse at the bonds of mother and son...and even a mother to all children in need.  It's a well-acted film, with Bel&eacute;n Rueda really terrific as the mother, Laura.  She's in virtually every scene, and it's her actions, reactions and emotions that drive the film.  We experience in through her eyes.  She's a fragile woman who finds pretty large reserves of toughness when she needs to, and it's nearly as satisfying watching her character grow as it is to see how the plot resolves.This movie doesn't cover new ground or show us anything we haven't seen before.  But it's skillfully made with no irony, and it simply works.  It's a pleasurable ghost story indeed.One note on the ""R"" rating:  There is one ""F"" word.  Otherwise, I think it gets an R because so much of the death and jeopardy involves children.  I think the film is fine for anyone 14 and over.",1200182400,2008-01-13
5.0,I really love the cast of characters and how they interact.  Good actors and interesting stories.  Having humor mixed in is great.,1383782400,2013-11-07
5.0,"Great show, love the way they feed off each other. and the dynamics of the show. would what again more seasons please",1394755200,2014-03-14
5.0,I have watched every season & every episode.  I thought when I started this was going to be a lot of fluff and impossible things for a woman in high heels.  To some extent the high heels part has happens a time or two but overall this has been a great show and the writers have not let it get stale although it is getting a bit hectic.  We need some downtime to let some of the interpersonal relationships work themselves out. I am concerned that we will not see much of Oded Fehr (the Israeli Mossad agent) since every episode he has been in was exceptional as pretty much anything I have seen him in since The Mummy.I am sure the writers will keep us addicted as always but high stress seems to be the name of the game in this entertaining series.,1403395200,2014-06-22
5.0,I like to show very much it keeps you in suspense he keeps you wondering if her and Wade I'm going to get back together I think they should,1389830400,2014-01-16
3.0,"Playback is not a scary movie. It didn't build any tension and the jump-out scares didn't work. The acting was about average, and so was the music. The story is what stood out to me and basically saved this movie. It's not really like The Ring, although it does have some elements from it. The story is actually creative and has some decent twists at the end. The tape in Playback basically possess those who watch it and the tape goes back for generations in the family. The film is based around teenagers, but isn't like your average teenage slasher. The intro was violent and probably the best part of the film, by the way.If you have time to kill or are slightly interested in this movie, check it out on Amazon Prime or Netflix streaming (available on both as of 6/15/12). Don't expect anything too scary cause you may come out disappointed.The movie has gore, sexual references, nudity and some frightening scenes.",1339718400,2012-06-15
