1,"Activated items not being discounted yet again! I double checked i got the correct items but the app says they werent in my basket! Getting really fed up with the way lidl have created a loyalty ""card"" app instead of a key fob physical card with discounts automatically given. There must be a mismatch of product numbers between the store and the app for this to be such a frequent occurrence. Please fix! UPDATE Im in Southern Ireland, have used the email address for ireland butnever get response",2021-11-05

4,There's been times I had to go to Aldi as your stores are out of stock things like eggs yogurts etc. Where as Aldi seem to have there shelves fully stocked.You need to start monitoring your local stores.

Lost a ¬£10 voucher a few weeks ago as the tills were having issues, and since then had a weekly shop fail to register, meaning i probably won't make it to the ¬£10 coupon this month.

1,"The app started crashing since yesterday's update, the cashier can log the purchase using your phone number but you do not have access to your tickets (paperfree). Regarding the benefits (when app works that is), well annoying having to activate promotions. Regarding the freebies, these are mainly on junk foods and low quality overprocessed products, so I don't even claim them. Other point why is there a Lidl and a Lidl Plus app, whats the point? Better to have a single one that works well.",2023-04-07

3,"Useable, but it gives no noticeable immediate feedback when scanned.... not the first time to notice that the coupons were not even registered on the block - after we got home from shopping.

In ""My account"" section they ask for some pretty deep marketing informations about yourself/family/habits etc (optional). So, this app is for their advantage, not for yours!

It's easy to forget them. The offers should just be automatically applied for everyone. - app should allow us to create shopping list by selecting items from the folder and offers. - shop sign said download the app and get 5‚Ç¨ coupon after 25‚Ç¨ shopping, and I didn't get it after shopping several times over.",2022-02-05

2,"I used to love this app but since Lidl updated the offers it seems pointless me using it anymore, so I've deleted it. I saved a total of ¬£3 last month despite spending almost ¬£250. I rarely get offers for the products I buy. You have to spend ¬£250 in a month to get 10% off your next shop whereas before you only had to spend ¬£200 to get ¬£10 off, which I thought was a much better offer. Overall I wouldn't recommend the app as you really aren't saving much at all!",2023-10-04
1,Decent app. Poor place to shop. Won't be spending as much with Lidl anymore due the loss of the ¬£10 voucher. Spend to get the ¬£2 off then shop elsewhere... shelves always empty.. aldi will be getting my hard earned money.. terrible place to go shopping as have to go shopping again after shopping here!!!,2022-09-27

1,If lidl actually sold good quality stuff they wouldn't need to trap you with a pointless reward scam! Deleted because it's a waste of time and damaging for the environment! And basically a scam!,2023-09-25
5,I really like this app. I love the vouchers and the bonus wins spin wheel and the new virtual scratch card. And the fact you get rewarded for money spent. For every ¬£100 spend over a month gives you a ¬£2 voucher and you don't need to have spend ¬£100 in one shopping trip. If you spend ¬£200 within the month then you get a ¬£10 voucher...but you need to keep an eye on your vouchers as they do expire within 7 days,2021-12-02

1,"The spending you accumulate over a month gives you vouchers to spend, the more you spend the higher the voucher value. Weekly money off coupons can also be activated. However, unspent vouchers don't roll over to the next month! Which does value the customer loyalty. The vouchers and coupons appear to be good value.

4,"Pretty good app for deals, especially when Lidl already has low prices. The biggest downside is that to get the discount for buying, you have to accumulate it in one month alone. I wish the coupons were also tailored to the user, not the app. What use is it to me when I get 7 coupons and 5 of them are for meat related products and I have a meat free diet?

There's also no reason to be online for voucher selection and redemption- your system will know the user's ID from their QR, so it can stop any attempts to have the system from the phone being offline.",2022-02-25

3,App works well and is relatively easy to use. Unfortunately there is no way to link a partner to an account. This means that for our family to benefit from earned discounts I have to shop all the time or my wife would have to. This means that money off discounts go to waste because I can't get to the shop before they expire. If my wife could spend my money off coupons and vise versa we would probably shop with lidle a lot more.,2022-08-18

Guy on checkout also verbally confirmed successful scan. Upon looking on phone afterwards I found that the transaction had not been recorded at all. Store Manager was aware of the problem but was unable to add the transaction to the app afterwards. This prevented me from obtaining a voucher that should have been due.,2023-04-21

1,Good app until you use Lidl pay! When you add a 2nd debit/credit card for Lidl pay it always defaults back to the 1st card you added when the app is closed meaning you have no ability to define your own default card. Next big problem is that there is no way to remove any credit/debit cards from the app! This means that I now have 3 different cards listed & I no longer wish to use 2 of them. For my own personal financial security I will need to delete the app from my phone.,2022-04-20

5,Useful to have as you get coupons and money off,2022-01-09
2,"Not much use as the scanners dont pick up on the QR code most of the time when using self service checkouts, which is what I mainly use, so pointless activating any codes as you can't get the discount applied. You can't scan the barcode on receipt either to have discounts applied to your account afterwards and used on next shop. Needs to be changed to a barcode system instead of QR code imo. Response to Lidl reply...I know how to use the app and activate coupons, the QR code doesn't scan!!!",2021-12-27

1,"A truly terrible app. Instead of updating with other apps, it waits until you get to the checkout and then advises that you HAVE to update before accessing your club card. As you have to input all you previously issued information, it takes about 10 minutes, with other customers waiting, not very patiently. Then, you have to verify your account, which takes another 10 minutes waiting for them to send an email that then takes you to a page to set up a new account. Someone needs a good kick up",2022-06-05

4,Overall app is good but very dependant on WiFi signal and the WiFi in the Skelmersdale store is non existant. Also the new tally counter is not worth it. ¬£250 to get 10% off is nowhere near as good as aiming for ¬£200 to get ¬£10 off. I would suggest reverting back.,2022-10-12

2,"App is becoming a bit of a con. Once you pass the ¬£50 or ¬£100 reward, it's only available for a few days to cash in. I only shop once a week, so the coupon expires.

4,"Great app and would give 5 stars if the coupons that I win wouldn't mostly be for items that I'm not interested in. I think the winning coupons should be based on items I've bought before and also, if there are previously won coupons that I've never used before, the app should learn that I'm not interested in those items and instead give me coupons for other things that I am interested in buying. Still a great app and I'd definitely recommend it. üôÇ",2023-09-08

1,Activated my 10% off coupon on weds pm - shopped on Thurs pm and found when I checked out of the store that the 10% coupon needed to be activated. Coupon expires tomorrow so I've lost the ¬£10 i should have saved. Very unhappy.,2022-12-01
4,"Anstatt zum Assistenten zu werden, erschwert Ihr Programm nur den Kaufprozess. Warum m√ºssen Sie einen Coupon ausw√§hlen und dann in einem anderen Abschnitt! Aktivieren? Warum geht das nicht in einem Schritt? Das Kassenbon ist so tief versteckt, dass es mehrere Minuten dauert, es zu finden.",2023-09-27
3,"You have to fiddle around to get it to scan the app, quite annoying sometimes. I also think ¬£2 voucher after spending a ¬£100 is pretty mean. I bought an aluminium table/trestle for ¬£40 this month but doubt I will ever get to ¬£100 spend again in a month as am a single household, and a ¬£2 voucher is no incentive, so will use Waitrose for some things especially fruit/veg.

If you really want to stay up to date with Lidl products & deals, then this app is for you. The truth is..

This all still during a period in which we are requested to stay distanced, not to mention commuting expenses and pollution to the environment. Maybe a good idea to extend coupons to at least a two week expiry period.",2022-04-06

Then it's only the rich who gain, they can afford to spend and gain the bonuses, if your poor like me, there's a pittance to be gained for the sake of having to have your phone on you",2024-02-18

1,Offers totally useless as I would never purchase these items. Obviously it is for benefit of lidl certainly absolutely no use to me. If you are paid bi weekly offers gone anyway before am paid. There fore I never stood a chance of actually getting them anyway. Fed up going to buy things you advertise but you never have them also for god sakes water your plants.

1,"Not happy with the new rewards. Very disappointed with it. Also Lidl seems to be struggling with stock. Lots of empty shelves and seems to becoming a bottle store. Will be shopping less now as Asda gives better rewards. This is a pity because I have always enjoyed shopping at Lidl, but got to go where it suits my pocket .",2022-10-19

The cashiers don't seem to notice either, so if I've not asked for a receipt in these instances the whole rewards scheme is pretty pointless‚Äîand this has happened several times.",2024-01-30

1,It was good when you got ¬£2 off after spending ¬£100 and ¬£10 off when you spent ¬£200. Now its free ice cream after 100 and you dont get another free item till after 250... Even then it's a packet of crisps. Its nor particulalry worth it anymore. The coupons are okay but when it's like 10% off a ¬£1.50 item it offers very little benefit.

1,"Just cheating with prices. Everything is marked onshelves in a deliberately misleading way. Lidl has turned from well-organized, well-run company into a cheap hustle. Lowered my buys yo minimum because I won't triple check for cheating. Rubbish! Samo nategovanje okoli cen. Vse namerno zavajajoce oznaceno na policah.Lidl se je v letu z urejenega, dobro vodenega podjetja, postal cenen nategovalec. Poden.

1,"Extremely disappointed with LIDL GB who sells a chicken breed that suffers immensely as they grow fast and large, and then struggle to support their weight. Unable to get up, most sit in their waste and get burns as a result. The conditions the chickens are kept in are filthy and cramped. The Better Chicken Commitment exists that LIDL GB can sign meaning a slower-growing and more natural chicken breed will be used and the living conditions improved. Less pain and suffering.

4,Not sure where the vouchers appear. I activated my voucher for ¬£2. The next day it did not appear when I shopped. The girl on the till said I should have activated it and said she could not do anything for me. Now that I look I find that the ¬£2 voucher has disappeared. The app does not remember when I have activated a coupon. It seems as tough I have to activate on the same day as I shop and not in advance. Disappointed.,2022-02-16

4,"I like this app and regularly save ¬£12 per month on my shopping. I've had no trouble scanning, etc. The negative is that the app can only be connected to one person/mobile. This means when my husband shops for items, no points are awarded, even though we are faithful Lidl customers always doing our main shops there. I will be short this month of the ¬£200 spend, because he did some shopping for me. Can you find a way for more than one person to be able to use the same account please?",2022-01-24

4,"Handy for digital receipts. If you buy anything that has a guarantee\warranty as it's on your phone. The starring option is a nice touch. Hopefully the app will reduce the need for the weekly recycling that Lidl enjoys putting in our letterboxes as you can view the paper in app. As for the offers... Meh.

4,"Edit: 10 days later, Lidl silently updated our stats. New rating 4/5 Original: Unfortunately, this app is unreliable. Even though it is scanned at the till, for us it skips 25% of purchases, meaning this month we will likely not reach the reward goal despite spending enough money. What makes it really strange is that in the same purchase, coupon is still applied. So they read from my card that I have active coupons, and apply the coupons, but still don't count the purchase into my total spent...",2021-11-02
4,Great value and good products.,2021-12-15
1,"'there is a new plus to coupon plus' it says now on the app, from 1st September... It's actually a minus. You now need to spend even more to actually get less. Great move. I don't feel like there is any profit to even scan the app anymore. It used to be good but now it's just disappointing. It's still a lot cheaper to shop at Lidl than at any other supermarket but the app is just a laugh.",2022-09-01

I have used the app since its launch and although Lidl doesn't have a wide range nor good stock levels I have often used the coupons and occasionally managed to hit the ¬£2 off voucher and once or twice the ¬£10 off.

There are some very misleading coupons which I have emailed customer service about to be told the product is not on the offer, despite the fact that the exact same image of the product and the size detailed in the description were used. You would think for the sake of 40p that Lidl would have honoured the value of the coupon, however they did not. Marketing need to be clearer.",2022-12-04

1,Dreadful. The time it takes! It has driven me back to Tesco which has a membership/discounting scheme which is at least customer centric . I used to shop at Lidl twice a week.

Utter unprofessional wind up crud - by which I mean that the app doesn't usually work and takes way too long when it deigns to. Requires far too much manual intervention by the customer and the coupons are usually for stuff I'd never buy. Additionally you never know which laser screen tge app wants to use, the one on the card reader or the one on the barcode reading platen?

1,"Coupons never match our grocery list. ""Rewards"" are also useless & you need to spend a crazy amount of money to get them. We don't want free bakery item that was exposed; anyone can touch it, sneeze on it, etc! It's 2023 & people are still doing their business this way! The overall food quality at lidl is just awful & I see no point in comparing them to other shops. Yes, they may be more expensive, but at least you can eat/enjoy what you buy.

4,Ok,2021-12-11
4,"I have never had a problem with this app apart from the more and more often you have to update WHY it doesn't make any difference.

3,"Love this app, use it a lot as I do get some decent coupons! However I do think the months target goals are a little rubbish! You have to spend ¬£50+ to get a free bakery item (which are usually like 39p to ¬£1.50), ¬£100+ to get ¬£2 off, ¬£150 for a free chocolate bar, etc etc! And to take the ¬£10 voucher away and change it to 10% off? Not great unless you're doing massive shops!",2022-12-09

5,Great app,2021-12-13
2,"Barely adequate app. Lidl are not well known for their digital shopping experience and this app does little to change that view. As a tool to communicate Lidl promotions and to keep a record of receipts it performs it's job. Unfortunately the promotions are usually pitifully underwhelming - but worse, you actually have to select coupons within the app to benefit from the offer. It's not sufficient to simply scan your Lidl barcode (like the entirety of all other shopping apps)",2024-01-08

5,Good app. Easy to use. I like that you have a digital total of how much you spent in store. The only problem I had once was no mobile Internet signal. This was solved by switching to the Lidi store Internet.,2021-12-21
5,"Lovely to get money coupons when spending the monthly amounts, thankyou, no reward for spending more than¬£200 why not? More coupons for everyday purchases would be useful.

1,"Seriously, this app is a joke! Never scans on the till. Never win any prizes on the scratchcard. The coupons are never customised for customers so many times they are not applicable. You only have 7 days to use the vouchers. When a problem arises due to app and you have to email the customer service, they never solve the problem or acknowledge the app problems. I guess with their prices they have to be cutting back cost somewhere and that place seems to be the app & customer service department!",2021-12-22
5,Excellent,2021-12-12

1,Glitchy App - the rare weekly coupons that are of use very often drop off after first usage. Most of the coupons are for things I never buy and don't like. Started shopping more in Sainsburys lately as their nectar and smartshop app has proper savings. Shame as been using Lidl for 20 years or so but it's gone largely rubbish lately and increased their prices ridiculously but not the quality of food.,2022-04-22

4,"Works well most of the time now that I'm used to it. Sometimes in store, internet reception might not be so good ... Either Lidl should provide free in store WiFi or cache the coupons and the current leaflet and offers on the phone so they are still available regardless of internet availability ( I notice the Lidl card is always available regardless of internet and so perhaps coupons attached to the account are available at checkout ?). Improvement suggestion : make app faster",2022-07-01

3,The bonus vouchers for spending over ¬£100 need to last longer than just a week. Very rarely have I had the chance to use them before they expire.,2022-02-22

3,I love the place a lot but today I go in at 3:59 on a Sunday and they tell me to go out even when the doors could still open. And I said to them I only needed two things but they still said to go out the other door. In my opinion I think that's just annoying. üò°,2023-10-15
5,Very happy,2022-11-23
4,Pleasant staff always helpful.,2023-08-31
5,Great app for shopping at Lidl. It has discounts which are automatically calculated if you activate them via the app and then scan the app at the checkout. After each purchase the app also shows you a digital receipt which is great for warranty purposes when you buy non-food products. Easy to navigate and set up too.,2022-08-13

5,Great way to see coupons and always have them with you. I always forgot the paper ones ( if they delivered the magazine!). My only complaint is that you can't add a missed receipt to your total ( my phone broke! ).,2021-10-29
1,I found it impossible to buy single carrots or choice of single pieces of fruit or veg dire. Fresh bread was excellent. Meat and fish looked okay. Personally not somewhere I would choose to shop again. I do not think it caters for people who live on their own.,2022-09-27

3,Was great at the beginning as I regularly got ¬£12 off each month as coupon lasted 8 days. However after latest tweak that's changed to 7 days. I go out once a week especially in lockdown so lose out. Won't be much point in keeping app if this doesn't change as other money off coupons rarely apply. August 2022 Someone was listening. Thank you. Tweaked again so vouchers are relevant to what I buy.,2022-08-17

1,Asks too much info and app permissions and gives minimal discounts. 4 euros for 300 euros of shopping is NOTHING.,2022-11-19
3,The app is easy to use. I can't get through to customer services or the store managers when I have issues. I spend ¬£200 a month. I can't understand why I am unable to use the ¬£10 and ¬£2 coupon together on one main shop. When I spend over ¬£200 why can't I save them onto the next month .,2022-02-25

4,"Often takes an embarrassingly long time to load when you're opening the app at the tills and the 'prizes' you win for scanning the app when you buy things are pants and I'm not keen on the pseudo-gambling feel of scratchcards/spin to win wheels. Other than that, works fine for tracking your receipts and spending and having the offers leaflet in the app is pretty handy wen you want to find out what this weeks middle of lidl stuff is",2021-11-21

1,¬£2.00 & ¬£10.00 vouchers. There should be no time limit in redeeming these vouchers. Once the voucher has been earn't / applied it should remain on the account until redeemed.

2,"Well, I've tried to claim 2 of my 3 free scratch card prizes but the items were not on shelf. Assistant couldn't help. Nice idea the app but more about Lidl maximising profits than maximising the value of the shop for customers. Since posting this I am finding the discounting part of the ap hit and miss. Today out of 3 items I activated only one showed up on my receipt as being discounted.",2021-11-28

1,Zojuist producten willen kopen uit de speciale app aanbiedingen. 1-Kassiere vraag niet naar de app. 2-Ik vind het belachelijk dat ik eerst de producten in de app moet activeren voordat ik de korting kan krijgen. 3-Daarnaast is het heel onduidelijk hoe ik bij mijn QR code kom als ik in de folder zit. Ik heb de app uiteindelijk maar herstart. 4-Ook wou de scanner mijn QR code niet accepteren. Toen bleek later dat er een popup van jullie half overgeen zat. Geweldig!,2023-02-19
5,"Great bonus, and coupons encourage me to try new items",2022-04-28
1,"Belachelijk dat je korting steeds moet activeren. Zeker als de app dan ook steeds vastloopt en de hele telefoon crasht.. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Kadootjes die steeds geopend moeten worden maar dan een foutmelding geven.

1,"UPDATE even better, the voucher expires after a few days. Pfft Rubbish reward now - 10% on a single shop, while the shelves are literally empty bare is a big step backwards. Also, everyone is using their vouchers in the same week while Lidl cant even cope with it's current supply problems. It can only be deliberate to make the 'offer' more mean. Used to be really good app. Hope this comment makes it into your Head Office presentation on why this scheme is tanking.",2022-12-11

2,"I have had no choice but to update this app 3 times in quite a short period of time. Everytime im advised of an update this app stops working, unless i update it. This cost me weeks of lost benefit of the app last time and this time its telling me to update i press it, it sends me back to the same page and then repeats! I now cannot use this app again, very frustrating as ive been using it with no difficulty for a fair while now.",2022-04-28
5,Very good,2021-10-07
3,"Could be better! I am single and your app doesn't offer as much as it might do for others. I've managed to miss-out on just about every prize/reward, I.e birthday donut and several ¬£2 rewards. This is because you only give 7 days to redeem these offers! I'm single and don't live at the shops!!!! Also, it appears your app waits until I get into a Lidl store and then begins to mess about! I.e suddenly needing to confirm my id I am considering uninstalling your app because of these facts.",2022-10-23

4,Straight forward,2023-06-15
1,"I've created an account in the app but every time I try to log in, the app says that the 'capacity has been exceeded' and that my e-mail or phone number is not tied to any account. Which is weird because I've both received the sms confirmation for my number and pressed the link to activate my account that I received in my e-mail. I hope it's some kind of networking issue on Lidls' end, but it's frustrating that I've been unable to utilize the deals this weekend because of network issues.",2023-08-27
5,Good value good prices. Fantastic bakery,2022-02-24
5,"The app is great, except the discount coupons are already discounts that exist in the shop so it is very misleading. You don't get additional discount on top of the already existing discount for the week in the store. At least that's how it is in Bulgarian Lidl stores. It's pointless to add coupons in that app.",2023-05-20

3,Got to be honest never get coupons that I use......!!!!,2022-12-18

5,Very easy to use! Great offers too!,2021-10-06
1,Why do I need to search for the item in the app and click the button for each item to get the discount. Why scanning the barcode is noth enough. Used to be simple. Now I like an idiot need to play with the app to get any discount. The app is getting worse and worse. Why not to put the items I shop frequently on the first page. Why not to have my shopping list that I can put items in and then get them in the shop. I really think you need to work on customer experience.,2023-12-28

1,"If there is a Champions League for useless customer loyalty apps, this app is the absolute winner. It requires constant sign in for no good reason at all. If the company cared so much for our privacy it would use a fingerprint option. I am happy I didn't use the coupons since I couldn't claim them for the bad reward program.

1,"Fehler: Keine Internetverbindung. Diese App ist die gr√∂√üte Frechheit seit es Apps gibt. Wenn man kein Android 7 oder h√∂her hat, kann man sie einfach nicht mehr nutzen. Das ist ist so armselig und peinlich von Lidl, weil es kein Fehler sondern vors√§tzlich so programmiert worden ist. Alle Nutzer mit Android < 7 pauschal vom Service auszuschlie√üen, ist eine Diskriminierung, die sich nicht rechtfertigen l√§sst. Absolute Entt√§uschung, nie wieder zu Lidl",2023-04-05

The amount of time it takes to scan the app at the cashiers is not worth the discounts that you get from your shopping.

3,Coupons are often fie items which are not in stock. Perhaps promotional items need increased stock levels! You also need to activate coupons. Surely if the coupon is on your account)app it should automatically be active. It makes you think Lidl don't actually want you to use the money off coupons.,2022-05-16

1,Sadly you offer discounts on obscure items that would be the bottom of any of your shopper requirements even me with my eclectic tastes if you really are sincere about offering discounts offer them for their spend in store or on basic items that the majority would want I'd forgo any discounts and give them to the families that at this time need them most sometimes as a company you have to step up the moral ladder in leadership,2022-09-21

5,Great service!,2022-04-25
3,I do like the app but I feel like I hardly ever get to use the coupons because they're not things that I buy or apply to me. Even when I win a coupon on the scratch card you would think those coupons would be tailored to me based on the things I buy but again they're not. And lastly I think that the coupons you do win like the ¬£2 0ff and bakery ones only last a week so you have to rush to use them instead of use them when you want to,2022-06-04
2,I find the app very primitiv as the cupans offered must be activated when you should focus on shopping and many times doesn't go through despite the activation. It should be activated automatically when customers activate their club card! otherwise its just hassling the consumers,2022-02-28

4,"App reliable most of time, fairly easy to use for the non-techsavy, but the discount vouchers are sometimes a bit random and certainly not linked to the things you actually buy.

1,"In the digital catalogue, one cannot select the pictures and zoom on them, so it is not possible to look at the details of a product. There is no search. The shopping list in this app is useless. I can add items from the digital catalogue to it, but when I go to the list, I cannot see the item info, nor the dates it is available in the store. Because of that I missed several items already. Well, If I miss an item at Lidl, I will buy it somewhere else. Cheers!",2024-03-23

Like with all other stores. Seems like a sneeky way to snub customers who only bothered to download the app for the coupons, as its not like they have a proper points/reward system (spend ¬£100 within a month to get a ¬£2 coupon is just silly).

5,It is a great tool to check your spending at Lidl. They are getting better at offering promotions. It could get improved by showing an instant notification that the qr scanning has been successful when you are at the till (for the hearing impaired!). I have used it for 2 years and only malfunction once at the till. Always ask for the shopping receipt! I would also appreciate that the vouchers where easier to navigate. Final idea: get us a shopping list that we can share with house-members!!!,2022-04-30

For some reason it wasn't recognised even though I'm 100% sure it,s correct. Trying to retrieve my password was taking too long and I felt so uncomfortable keeping the growing queue waiting I'd no choice but to abandon my attempts and forego any savings I use a number of loyalty schemes and this is by far the worst one",2022-03-07

5,Useful app to collect points and get coupons. Have to use the coupons within 7 days and they aren't always very useful. You used to get ¬£10 of you spent ¬£200 in a month but now you have to spend ¬£250 to get 10% off next shop.

As a result I am much more often doing my smaller convenience shopping trips closer to home. An own goal, Lidl! Change it back!",2023-01-26

1,"Awful never loads in my new local Lidl despite being connected to in store WiFi. Stock levels aren't great, started off great but are dwindling now. Rewards now are not worth shopping there that was a real draw with the ¬£10 coupon. I've gone back to Aldi for my main shop again.",2022-10-06

1,It's funny that I have to each time open the app to activate discount manually before I could see any of the app. Just like an app written by my grandfather back in 70s.

Voucher you win from the wheel, need to have a long date, as the product you are offering a discount last several week. Jam voucher should be four weeks before expiring. Chocolate items should be 7 day before expiring. The app take a long time to open.",2023-07-06

I am finding that increasingly, items I would like are out of stock and there are big gaps on shelves. Just because I choose to shop on a Friday or Saturday evening shouldn't mean big gaps every week. With cost of food going up, I'd like to see offers more on the staple foods. I also seem to have just lost money off coupons that are still in date. C'mon lidl",2022-08-24

1,Good idea like the app but vouchers don't last long. Do majority of shopping in Tesco where clubcard last a year. I save vouchers for Christmas spend. Since my last review this app has got even worse. The scratch card awful. When you win something it's for the most random useless product The rewards reduced even more. This is why Aldi had my 2023 Christmas spend,2024-01-02

1,"Got to the till, opened up app, app asked to update otherwise can't use it, due to no internet coverage in shop impossible to update. As a result my points for shopping are gone. You low quality devs should leave QR code to scan in event like this.",2024-01-11

5,Love using it but one problem there has been is that at one store it didn't work so you lose your money spent being added. This happened to me and I spent over ¬£20 and it couldn't be added towards my reward of ¬£10 when I spend ¬£200.,2022-02-17
3,"Nightmare. Every time I try to use it, I'm asked to sign in, it won't let me sign in, just continously asks me to do it. Yes, I've tried to update the app, has this worked? No it has not. Very embarrassing at checkout. All sorted now. Had to change the browser.",2022-06-13

5,Life easier if you do your shopping in lidl you get discount vouchers ilove it,2022-04-28
1,The coupons they provide is never tailored to what you actually buy from them so I rarely get to use them unlike other supermarket stores. Also they have a spin and wheel game after you shop with them but rarely win. Also you have to spend ¬£100 to get ¬£2 off and then ¬£200 to get ¬£10 off your next shop but only have around 5 days to claim coupon which if your weekly shop doesn't fall into then days or you can't get to the shop within that time you lose out.,2022-04-21
1,Why do i have to use app to shop at lidl??,2021-10-13
1,"Coupons expire too quickly. When you just did a huge shop to reach the ¬£100 or ¬£200 and then have only 6 days to use them, its a pain in the neck. I havent used any of mine and lost them. If you forget your phone, points cant be added later. Not worth bothering with. If you get a ¬£2 voucher and a ¬£10 you cannot use them both at the same time. Rip off. I have lost several ¬£2 vouchers because of it. I have lost numerous ¬£10 vouchers too, due to the app not working. Staff don't remind you.",2022-12-04

And it would be great if all coupons were automatically activated, like in the Kaufland app. You would save customers a bunch of time and some money, as sometimes you pay full price for items you forgot to apply the coupon for. Not having to be online to use the client bar code would also make it easier and quicker and I think it would get you more card scans.",2022-04-23

1,"This whole set up is biased in favour of those who live near Ludl Stores. I cannot use money voucher savings etc as I am being forced to have to travel a distance of approx 32 miles round journey because of where I live. Fuel us expensive, bus service is poor and don't forget my carbon footprint! I do a large shop and cannot go every week just to make sure I can get my discounts so I lose out continually. Why don't you think about people who live a long distance away from yr stores?",2022-02-22

1,"Free items are never available in the stores. From communicating with Lidl it is clear that this is deliberate, they only make a small amount of each free item available in each store so that they do not have to give away too much of the allegedly free items. Once the free items are gone they are not replenished in the stores until after the free period ends. Extremely dishonest by Lidl, this entire app and promotion is only designed to get people into their stores, not to give away free items.",2022-04-12

1,Why do lidl take away customers vouchers that have monetary value I.e. the ¬£2 or ¬£10 vouchers if not spent within 7 days. This is pure robbery to be honest because some stores give you a year to spend or redeem your vouchers in store. I lost my voucher after being away on holidays for a week. This is not lidl on honesty but lidl on deceit lol. Can I get my voucher back plz. üò´,2022-06-08

3,"The app was excellent, the Scan your Lidl Plus Card feature is not brilliant (mainly due to in-store equipment, rather than the app feature). Lately the app crashes on opening, stays resident after 'closing'; continually producing the ""info, close, feedback"" crash dialogue. Update: The only solution is to uninstall and reinstall, nothing else will fix this problem. Advice: screenshot the QR code, which will scan tracking purchases; you will not be able to activate coupons or get rewards.",2022-01-21

2,It is painfully slow and requires you to activate each coupon each week. It would be so much better if this was done automatically - especially for the daily instore bakery coupon. I use a card I printed of the QR code which is so much quicker to use in store and is welcomed by all the store assistants as it is quicker to use than the phone. You should issue them to all people.,2022-02-25

3,"Whilst I like the idea of rewards it is very frustrating that the ¬£2 & ¬£10 vouchers must be spent within 7 days. Also if any alcohol at all in the trolley the coupon cannot be used even if the cost of other goods is far higher. The scratch card is also a mystery as sometimes it appears and others not, it doesn't appear to be linked to the amount spent. Having said this I love Lidl the shop but the app can be frustrating.",2022-02-24

1,I am a loyal lidl customer but I no longer have a local store. So I do an approximate 40 mile round trip once a fortnight spending ¬£150 plus in lidl each trip. The lidl plus app would be beneficial with its promise off a ¬£10 voucher reward if you spend ¬£200 a month together with its money of product vouchers which I do valify for. BUT all the voucher you receive are only valid for 7 days therefore are no use to me WHAT SO EVER,2021-11-12

Ich kann mich nicht anmelden, ich muss vor der Anmeldung und nach der Anmeldung meine Filiale ausw√§hlen, die gleiche kann ich nicht w√§hlen und wenn ich eine andere w√§hle st√ºrzt die App immer ab. Ich kann sie echt garnicht benutzen - s21 ultra mit Android 12 OneUI 4.0. Hit me up wenn ihr mehr infos braucht Edit: kein Update gemacht und trotzdem geht sie jetzt. Lag das vielleicht am Sonntag?",2022-01-24

5,"Save so much money with coupons ,and vouchers . All food reliable and good quality wouldnt shop anywhere else .",2021-11-18
4,Easy to use. It's a disappointment that the benefits earned expire after 7 days. I understand that they can't last forever but 14 days wouldn't go amiss. Sometimes we don't always shop the same day every week. I've also had occasion when a shop has gone through two of the targets and you only reward the later one.,2023-02-10

3,Uninstalled used 1 month digital receipt could be helpful i don't need it. bakery offer didn't work the cashier told me have to re-queue with just that item to redeem it which t&cs don't make this clear disappointing & pointless,2022-06-27
4,Simple to use,2021-11-21
5,It is wonderful I can save some little money with Lidl plus.,2021-10-29
1,I can't seem to find a damnn shops in my area where i give it the correct adress and all full necessary details but i can't find a single shop i could click onto to proceed with the logging in. And before i reset the app as well i couldn't access the app telling me there is some type of failure to show me the discounts and everything in the app except am able to click just to register my lidl plus. . . Which now i cant even access because i deleted and installed it again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Just nonsense!,2023-12-01

4,Very enjoyable,2022-02-25
2,"Oh dear. Front end mostly fine but let down by diminishing back-end performance and fundamentally eroded rewards scheme. I'm not sure it's entirely coincidence that since the rewards were slashed, updating of transaction history has been slowed by several hours and push notifications stopped, making it less practical to do the split and ""immediate return"" shops (previously recommended by checkout staff) needed to make the most of the scheme especially in this age of spiralling travelling costs.",2022-10-15
5,Excellent all round,2021-12-23
1,The app is rather good looking and simple to use. But it has 2 drawbacks. 1. The qr to show at the checkout should be accessible offline. In Lidl stores reception is bad so that results in app being unusable most of the time as I'm unable to scan qr at the checkout. Btw I tried opening qr before entering store. After locking phone and some time qr needs refreshing. 2. Coupons should be available without manual activation. Otherwise it's cheeky way to cut my benefits but lidl still gets my data,2023-11-09
2,"App is working okay but worthless cupons and rewards to me. Also what is the point of activating coupons before scan my digital card ? Offers should already be loaded, this is just slowing process at the tills as everyone trying to activate majority of worthless coupons. You could workout some better algorithms offers a better usable coupons. Rival supermarkets are definitely better at this game, but there is always room for improvement .",2023-01-13
5,The best!,2022-04-05

4,Amazing...,2022-04-21
4,Just getting started and find it very useful.,2022-03-13
3,It seems to work and gets some savings. After using it for a while it has become a faff. There are updates that can stop you accessing your card and if at the till then its not convenient. Having to activate every coupon is a pain.,2021-10-21
5,Great,2022-08-24
4,great offers. nice staff.,2022-03-21
5,Love Lidl very happy that it's in my home town,2021-11-18
4,"It's great to save even more money on already low prices. However there have been glitches- on one occasion the scanner wasn't working. On another I scanned my app but the cashier cancelled it and i didnt realise until I got home, so my purchase wasn't recorded. No option to rectify so disappointing.",2022-07-30

5,Great app,2023-12-01
5,"Good app, easy to use, offers discounts in addition to Lidl's already low prices. Keeps a track of your till tickets so you can check them on your phone later if you need to. The only niggle I found is that it is offered only in the language(s) of your country. In my country, English is the third major language and it would be helpful to have this app in that language too. (I wrote this review in English as that was the option offered on Google Play üòÄ). Edit: now offers paperless tickets.",2023-01-26
5,"Very good easy shopping experience,polite staff.",2022-03-31
1,"Erratic app, doesn't works sometimes Very inconvenient at till if you buy stuff expecting discount. The machine didn't read the card yesterday and the store member didn't do anything just kept saying your card doesn't work",2021-11-25
3,"If it looses Internet connection refuses to work again. Even turned phone off and on again, uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it still said 'no Internet connection' despite all other apps working fine. Also wish you could get a card for your wallet so you don't have to take phone with you. I have lost out on a number of shops when app refused to connect due to no Internet connection in the shop. Have missed out on two ¬£10 coupons as a result. Really reduces your feelings towards lidl",2022-04-14

3,When 10% off your shop is shocking loyalty!!! Used to get ¬£10 voucher when you hot the 250 target spend. Now you get 10% off shopping. When my average spend is ¬£30 ....¬£3 off my shopping isn't alot. Alas when you hit smaller targets you get free produce.....usually around ¬£3!?!?! So does not make sense at all.
