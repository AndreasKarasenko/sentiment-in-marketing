5,Good place for seeing good posts,2024-01-12
1,Did Elon buy Reddit while I wasn't looking? One of the most frustrating experiences of my life. Enough to make me never want to use Reddit ever again. Or any other social media app tbh.,2023-11-29

5,Excellent all around,2024-01-11
1,Sends notifications for things i haven't joined and I don't want. I have even selected 'Hide Community' but it still sends me notifications. Going to uninstall after today if this persists.,2024-01-07
1,This app is just far inferior to any of the third-party offerings I have used in the past. The UI is clunky and unintuitive and it really doesn't need to be.,2024-01-21

5,I love it,2024-01-15
5,So much good information!,2024-02-17
4,I mean it‚Äôs reddit. Once you teach it what you‚Äôre into it‚Äôs a great way to get your news and information. And if you need to see some funky or funny stuff hahaha Quiet helpful that they ask you on signup what you‚Äôre into so you don‚Äôt have to start from scratch. Just a bit cluttered,2024-03-14
1,Good luck scrolling through photos on a post with multiple. Can't delete unsolicited messages either lmao. It's a shame how poorly managed Reddit is,2024-03-16
4,Good,2024-02-21

1,"Just not as good, fewer features than other 3rd party clients.",2023-11-16
1,"With each update the user experience keeps getting worse. In a world of seamless gestures, Reddit forces you to shuffle between the content and back button simply to view right what's in front of you.",2024-03-26
3,Would please like to see Reddit get a translation option like TikTok and Facebook has. It's a hassle coping each comment and putting it into Google translate.,2023-12-18

5,Easy to use,2024-03-23

1,Stop asking me to review your app and I will stop giving out 1 star reviews,2024-03-21
1,"Horribly bugged for weeks. Can no longer minimize comment threads, clicking links brings you to other links, etc. Moving to a different reddit app. 7 years later edit: app's gotten more buggy and reddit doesn't care because they banned all the alternatives. Horrible company. Hope the IPO bankrupts all your execs.",2024-03-09
1,"Reddit you have to post pics or videos perfectly or it does a weird buffering thing then you see what you've posted 2 or even 3 times . I thought reddit was a "" better "" experience than fb wrong it's actually worse if that's possible .03/27/2024 wth is with censoring deleting what adults say .",2024-03-28
5,Excellent,2024-01-14
5,Juice,2024-01-25
4,I like Reddit for the most part. I much prefer using Reddit from my laptop program. Reddit on phone app is a pain. I find it harder to check my favourite reddits.,2024-01-14
1,Terrible. This is the worst Reddit client. Search for any other on the play store.,2024-03-13
1,"Every single time they update the app, the UI gets more worse. Ex: You used to download an image by hitting a button in the top right corner, and then hitting download in the same spot. Now, when you hit that button, the download button is on the opposite side of the screen. Why? Why do Reddit software engineers insist on 'fixing' things that aren't broken. They don't even give us the option to keep the UI the same, these updates have to be so someone can justify keeping their job. FIX. IT.",2024-02-16
5,What social media should be,2024-01-29

2,"I keep getting notifications from subreddits that I don't follow through the app and even when I try to turn off said notifications and specify which subreddits, I keep getting notifications from them. I've even muted some subreddits and get notifications from them. There should be no reason why I get notifications from places I have muted.",2024-01-01

2,"I miss RIF. This is chunky and awkward. Also, why do I have to tap back twice to exit? Just exit. It's not an accident.",2023-12-31
1,"Full of bug. They don't even bother fixing it. And to top it off, they have the worst customer service ever. Bad mods and bad developers. And it each update it gets worst.",2024-02-04
1,"The Reddit app has issues more frequently than any other app I use. Issues loading comments, going down randomly, and features that they inexplicably decide to remove. Know what app I didn't have issues with for like 10 year? RIF...",2024-03-07

1,terrible experience,2023-11-03
1,"Update Jan 2024 The same issue arose again with remedy on the helo forums and no response from a Reddit rep. Updated Oct 1,2022. Reddit has become less user-friendly. The company doesn't even respond to customer inquiries or comments mase here. I have asked numerois times why I am unable to cross post and have not received a response. NO DELETING AND RELOADING THE APP DOES NOT FIX IT! I enjoy the various subjects I can follow on this platform.",2024-01-16

3,Can you stop replacing every photo and gif with a damn * symbol?,2024-03-28

1,constant crashes. my ex was more stable than this app.,2023-12-06
1,bad business practices,2023-11-27
1,"The app has not been working properly lately. Doesn't load the jump arrow at the bottom, says the rest of the comments are loading, just overall very laggy and bad. If they're going to IPO, this better be the best app ever by that time. It's just been going downhill.",2024-03-02
5,"Works seamlessly, better than most apps.",2024-03-14
1,"the app is slow, barely works, deletes things at random, doublse things at random, and often has a confusing layout, especially when posting",2024-03-18

5,It's fascinating,2024-03-13

3,Topics and comments are good. Don't like my comments being automatically deleted just because I'm new.,2023-11-10

5,Awesome,2024-03-06
1,"Wish I could rate it 0 stars, trashiest app I've ever used",2023-12-23
1,I'd prefer being able to use the website,2023-11-05
1,New changes for the worse. Now they changed the direction you swipe to go to the next post. THIS ISN'T TIK TOK AND WE HATE IT. Posts on trying to find a way to disable this horrible change get deleted. This app will be uninstalled before the IPO launches because the stupid decisions will get even worse then.,2024-03-20
1,Apsolutely useless! Can't even open it,2023-12-17
1,"Mod a sub? Too bad! Want to post to or view a collection? Too bad! This app is developed by folks who literally don't use the Reddit app, or the dev team of the site and the Dev team of this app are fighting each other and not on speaking terms. Update: Was banned for insulting a Nazi. Permabanned. Reddit Admins Defend Nazis. Amazing. What a time to be alive. Wish I could give negative stars.",2023-12-07
2,"Ads galore! Every third post is an ad or suggested sub I have zero interest in. I've never been into anime, but reddit thinks I love it. I miss Boost",2023-11-07
4,Its coo!,2023-11-30
1,"Pretty fun app overall i love being able to talk to others about electric scooters but hate that the app randomly crashes and though i updated the app today, i cant seem to be able to reply to comments now like i did before. I believe i should have enough ""merit"" to at least do that since i still can't post images of my scooters yet. That's the only thing i dont like about this app, this whole merit thing to prevent spammers. Im definitely not a spammer and run a youtube channel about scooters.",2023-12-05

1,"This app is horrible for so many reasons that I'm sure have been mentioned in other reviews. Good job, Reddit. I went from using Reddit every single day for maybe an hour to using it once a week for a minute or two. Hope you all are happy.",2024-02-24
1,I hate it here. Stop changing things when they are perfectly fine and maybe focus on ADDING BACK features that you previously removed. Also allow 3rd party apps to be made and used without forcing them to pay you huge amounts of money.,2024-03-26
5,up all night baby!,2024-02-20
1,"App is not managed by anyone, all requests to support team is just a joke.",2024-01-08

3,"Idk what happened to one of the most happening places on the internet, it's just not the same anymore",2023-12-13
3,"Has become worse over time. While I do enjoy the content of the subreddits I follow very much, I've noticed lately there's more algorithms at play to suggest new content to me. This was exactly why I left all other social media platforms, algorithms are a poison, and I prefer to just be fed the content I already know I want because otherwise I end up in more toxic environments. In addition to this the app itself is rather buggy with images never loading. All this to say I'm done with reddit",2024-02-29
3,Confusing interface. Looking for secret dating.,2023-11-18
1,"Found a post with a question nobody has answered so I attempted to use Cunningham's principle and proved the wrong answer in order to stimulate a knowledgeable person to provide an accurate one. A redditor replied that I was violating terms by providing a garbage answer, said there were many other possible answers -- but also failed to provide a single answer the the original question. I was no longer allowed to post to that community! Hitler would have been so proud of that redditor!",2024-01-09

1,Biased censorship they ban anyone for talking about hamas and doesnt let people post israeli combat footage but ukraine and YPG combat footage is fine the reddit mods (not the server admins the actual owners of reddit) are biased in the way they moderate i got banned for saying october 7th was a terrorist attack,2023-11-16

1,"Could you maybe not put EVERYTHING on the home feed? ""Show fewer posts like this"" does nothing. Every day there is more trash on the home feed because once upon a time you clicked into something on accident. Half your time will be spent muting subs because Reddit wanted to be like Instagram.",2023-11-30
1,"Update October 2023. The apps home feed shows only a few posts from a random subreddit, or not at all. If you refresh nothing shows up. You have to manually switch between subs if you want to browse them, and reddit bug report takes me to a subreddit that's barely moderated. If I could give it a 0, I would, had nothing but issues so far.",2023-10-28
1,It's crazy that this app is worse than Facebook with people that think they know what they're talking about,2024-01-20

1,"This app is absolute garbage, every other post is a recommended post, or an ad. On top of that, all of a sudden whenever I open a post or video, the post or video attached to it is not available.

I've tried clearing the cache, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I've tried using a different account, but nothing fixes it. This wouldn't be an issue with third party Reddit apps, but that's not an option anymore. We're forced to use a substandard and buggy app.",2023-12-05
1,Bans new accounts for just posting stuff,2023-12-14
1,"The one star is because there is no option for zero. Not new user friendly. My experience was horrible, downloaded the app and barely one week in my account was shadowbanned because I made a post asking for advise as a new user. Very horrible experience, waste of data and time",2023-12-25

1,"Memes aside, reddit is genuinely no longer fun nor interesting anymore. So much quality of life is missing from this app that the third party apps used to have. It's a shame they chose greed over functionality and accessibility.

1,No posts are loading anymore. Un-installed.,2024-03-25
1,New UI is dog water. Every post I click on sends me to the comments not the post. Swiping will lead to completely different posts. Clicking on things sometimes gives me what is next to it. Contarant phantom clicks make me open the wrong thing or even worse ads. It must be intentional since they want the click revenue. This app is so horrificly atrocious and they should be ashamed. Bring back third parties the incompetence is too much. Edit: it literally gets worse every update.,2024-03-15

3,Excellent until the day before yesterday. Then they banned me for asking a question that wasn't even against the rules. It took two days for my appeal to go through.

1,"ETA: Search function doesn't work. New interface makes it impossible to find what you're looking for. It's clear they just gave up. No respect for the user. The app is painful to use, and the content creators that make this app don't receive nearly as much support as moderators, who also don't get the support they need.

I bet, as with every large company, that engineers and designers are told what to do instead of their input being valued. It shows. Spammy spammy mc spammy is the name of the game.

When I swipe back I doesn't go where I left off so I have to scroll back down again. Information is just not organized that well. We don't need to see who the poster was, not that important. Also, how do you even turn off Auto Play I just want to read the comments without the video going on repeat. Edit: default comment sorting doesn't save",2024-02-20
1,"Tiny, tiny text. Why no option to allow for larger fonts sizes? Among all the other problems this app has, the locked font size is the worst for me. It's also the most confusing, as it should be a relatively easy feature to add.",2023-12-10

1,"This is a 0 star situation. It's reddit. It has to replace all of Google seeing as they s h a t the bed. You think such a massive website wouldn't hijack the back button in android. If I tap a reddit link in my browser, the browser will lock up, and force me to view the thread in the app. If I do, the app hijacks the back button and won't let me return to my browser.

I'm constantly accidently swiping between home and popular and losing my spot.

1,"The font size is too small (a few notches smaller than any other app on my phone) and the only way to change it is to change the global font size on my phone - but then every other app becomes too big. Also, when the app asks you if you want to give feedback, instead of taking you to a form, it takes you to a knowledge base. That's a pretty surefire way to annoy your users :)",2023-11-16
5,Reddit is the best place to be on the internet and has everything I need. If Reddit were a restaurant you'd be able to taste and eat every food on the planet. I'm completely addicted and go through withdrawals if I can't be here every day/night. Enjoy folks.,2024-02-21

1,"Update 3: So difficult to leave feedback, even as signed in user. This app is bound to have bad UX. Update 2: Why does the back button scroll the page back to the top? I pressed it by accident. Update 1: Autoplay is not working at all. I have it set to wifi only. Update 0: Swiping multi-image post ends up swiping to different tabs. Image/videos do not load very frequently.

2,"Stop recommending random subreddits. Stop showing content that I am not interested in. ""Show fewer post like this"" option is useless.It says ""popular in your country"" while recommending irrelevant posts. I don't care if it's popular or not. I'm not interested. Now only option I have is to individually hide each new subreddits to stop them from being recommended. So annoying. Just reverse the home feed algorithm to how it was over an year ago. Just show content from subs i joined or similar subs",2024-02-25

2,whatever you did with the ui when viewing a post is absolutely stupid. a video should not autoplay in that unnecessary header. please let us turn that off,2024-03-21
1,Hot garbage. Reddit prompts us to get off of the reddit website and onto their app and then bans all other apps that make reddit a joy to use.

4,"There are good and bad subs, but I mainly appreciate Reddit for the help I get on some of my questions and issues, like when I was renovating my bathroom and kitchen. I also like the variety of interests like nature and such. It always keeps me interested. I hope Reddit does it's best to be watchful of AI deep fakes. Maybe provide an indication when a post is AI driven. It's getting harder to tell the difference between what's real or honest versus fake and dishonest.",2024-03-10

1,"So... I created this account with Google login API... No password necessary, just log in through Google... Now, somehow, my account was hacked and subsequently locked... The recovery email was set to something other than my Gmail account, and a password was set... I've been trying to unlock my account for weeks now, with no visible progress. Ridiculous, considering that despite not ""knowing"" the password on my account, I can still log in through Google, this they should know IT'S ME...",2024-01-09
3,Good,2024-02-06
4,"The app is good, but the video player condtantly runs into problems and there are a few other stupid glitches here and there like when I open a post and go back it refreshes all the posts I had seen",2023-12-09
5,Usefull,2023-12-30
5,"I really like this App when I bought it from US Cellular from Thursday, September 24, 2020 at 5:00pm. For example, I'll have to get as many Updates on a daily basis. I'll have to Rate this as high as a 5 because I'll have to Restart my Device daily and often to avoid getting any error messages on my mobile phone. I have too many GB's and I'm going to delete some in order to get it down to zero. That's what I'm going to do when my contract expires on October 2026. Thank you for sharing it today.",2024-02-20
1,"Disgusting UI, terrible accessibility and zero customisation. Not single user friendly feature, never saved your preference/actions (ask every time) and full of maliciously placed ads covering usual content. Transparent layer over content so whenever you want to check out the author, the worthless pop up shows a company instead, just like any other malicious sites practices. Also can't view user profiles.",2024-02-05
1,Videos keep playing audio as I scroll past. Pages won't load. But most infuriating is that I can't use it in landscape mode on my tablet. Really? Why is that even an issue.,2024-01-17

4,Is what it is,2024-01-28
1,"Crashes or doesn't load at all. New update made the UI worse when the old one was fine and all. This app is abandoned, unloved and uncared for. And the Admins are trash with no qualifications on handling anything important in their pathetic lives. CEO is also pathetic pandering to so much Censorship that it feels like anything you say is going to be reviewed and judged by losers with no life called ""Mods"" this app has no purpose, it should bankrupt itself NOW.",2024-02-18

5,Excellent√©,2024-02-11
5,It's pretty good if u need a question answered,2024-02-20
1,Absolutely useless bunch. Everyone just arbitrarily decides what you get to do and there are no second chances. No one explains anything and a few get to decide who advances. Its not revolutionary it just sucks like all the rest but is even harder to understand how the rules work because there aren't any concrete ones.,2024-01-03
5,There's so much things I can find from almost every genre,2024-02-02

1,"why the hell does it let you keep swiping into random photos when you get to the end of the set in the post you're looking at. I shouldn't have to count the dots to restrain myself, this is just slimy design to push clicks and increase wasted time on the site to bump ad revenue",2024-03-20
1,"After having resisted *years* of being forced to move over from the (mobile) web to the app you've been pushing (hard!), I relented & tentatively decided to give it a go. And, oh well! what else can I say, other than... FFS, you guys seriously s*ck at UX!! It's just, so unbelievably bad, it's not even funny.

1,Reddit got the most worstest moderators I have ever seen... They just gonna banned you for any slides mistakes üò≠,2024-01-14
1,You're better off using your mobile web browser and requesting the desktop side. App lacks extremely basic functionality like the ability to select/copy text or view external websites in your own browser. Difficult to scroll through image galleries instead of consecutive image posts. No easy way to get back to the home screen. Notification settings are a joke. Ads obscure pinned posts. 500 characters aren't enough to say how bad this app is.,2023-10-29
1,"By far the worst Reddit app, I'm just going to stop using red instead of downloading this",2023-12-29
5,I love that tou can vote on posts and comments. Feels like real democracy,2023-11-24

4,New here on Reddit. Learning how to navigate in it. Thanks,2023-12-14
1,"I hate giving one star to this app because the reddit community is amazing, but I hate how terrible the app experience is compared to the old third party apps. Post / comment sorting is hard to reach, ads autoplay videos, clicking on posts results often on a black screen, posts on a subreddit don't stay cached. I hate this version of reddit.",2023-11-06
5,"The app has a variety of different communities, and has enough protocols in place to avoid bot accounts or someone creating a new account to continue disturbing behavior. There should be more to curb this behavior, but they're doing better than the majority of other apps. I enjoy the communities I'm in.",2023-11-16
1,I can't scroll now when I'm clicking on some video and can't see more of this kind. Before had much better use and easy approach,2024-01-02
1,Updates constantly make the app worse. Most recent cause the app to crash if you try to comment on a post,2023-12-06
1,"if I could give negative stars, I would, due to the poor quality of the app, I find myself lost in menus and whatnot, unable to navigate it, also, I have found myself logged out of my account, when I changed the password to something, copy pasted it into the login field, and yet it said my password was wrong, what gives people? how hard is it to make a functional login form? I've been able to do that since I started developing android apps",2024-03-09

5,It's reddit..,2024-03-27
4,"Despite the neverending display of visually documented genitalia...nevermind. MY REVIEW IS THIS: The platform has more depraved material available for those among us who seek it than it does life-affirming material for those among us who seek it. I wish they'd balance that out a little better. In conclusion, yadda, yadda, yadda, and there's no way in Hell I'd recommend this app to someone I love, or even to an enemy unless that enemy said something disparaging about a family member.",2024-02-26

1,"Horrible app, and instead of trying to improve their app, they tried to kill all the third party apps for Reddit. Absolute garbage; I would rather stop using Reddit than be forced to use this abomination of a mobile app. Horrible UI desgn focused on bombarding you with ads.",2024-03-11

1,"It's so buggy, it's gotten worse after every update and it's basically impossible to use this app without going through countless complications like the video player not working most of the time and posts not loading despite having a good wifi connection and it's so buggy overall not to mention the pictures and gifs in the comments section of a post doesn't load at all or takes forever to load.",2024-01-04

1,Just use an open source client and add the features like ads and DMs. It would be much better than this app. Your app issues you need to address. You're only still in business because people are good at making content.,2023-12-11
1,"Finally buckled and installed the app after Reddit was scum and went after third-party apps, I was tired of mobile-browser Reddit. This app is like 2% better than the mobile browser site, which they make harder to use in an effort to get you to download this garbage anyways.",2023-11-14
1,I hate this app. It's more miserable than the Web. You can't really cut and paste and the app frequently forgets what you were last reading. So what's the point? Use a browser f this pointless excuse for an app.,2023-12-08

I do have to advise, this is an app you should only use on WiFi, because oh boy does it go through data fast. Even when not using it. Highly suggest turning background data for it off, just so you don't run out of data. But yes it did work as stated. Not minor friendly though.",2024-02-18

1,I've used and loved reddit for a long time and things keep getting worse. I have no desire to use instant apps. I don't understand why the toggle switch was removed from advanced settings but if I just need to use my browser all together so be it.i thought the point of making an app for your web page was to make things look and feel better on mobile devices not make it worse.

1,The least user friendly app out of any platform by far. Any normal platform accepts appeals and is forgiving for stupid mistakes. This app is like a communist country. They have so many little rules and you can't make a mistake or else you're treated like garbage instead of like a human being. Moderators have power to ban anyone for anything and the Reddit admind themselves just let anyone and everyone get banned or suspended. At least have a convo with someone to chat about what's going on,2024-01-19

1,Consistently buggy and unreliable. Keeps recommending me hate groups no matter how much I tell the app I don't want to see thesse groups. It's basically impossible to look up the news on controversial topics doesn't result in your feed getting flooded with Neo-Nazis and Tankies. That's when it's not crashing or bugging out not providing useful information. Just use old reddit through your browser in desktop mode. It's less painful,2023-12-05

1,Dealing with the moderators on this app is challenging to say the least. Most of them have a snobby attitude and act like it's a special privilege to let you post to a sub.

2,"After reading some posted reviews, I now think this app isn't even worth updating. As little as I actually use it, it doesn't seem to be worth the amount of memory that it takes up. There seems to be a downward spiral trend of older, more reliable, popular apps that were developed by innovative industry giants. Why release updates that degrade & destroy? The things that brought users flocking now have them fleeing instead. What's the agenda now if it's not wealth & power?",2023-11-21

1,"It used to be a great app but with every update it gets worse, everything UI related has been changed for something worse, the new video player is so bad it's ridiculous, you can't even see the flair/media type anymore and even watching the comments is more complicated now, the app just refuses to open HQ media which also used to be one of the apps best features when compared to others, it's gotten so bad it's ridiculous.",2024-01-22

1,"This is legitimately the WORST site on the entire internet. Not even Twitter compares to this. Constant glitches, random network issues, several problems commenting, people are both toxic and soft as hell, I can't even change my profile name without deleting my account and making a new one, only allowed to post one pic per post and I've straighthad to delete this app 3 times and nothing has changed. If anyone sees this please never use this app. Just don't. Do yourself a favour and stay away.",2024-01-28

4,interesting üòé,2024-03-22
1,What a miserable app. Should have left it to the 3rd parties since this can't function smoothly and efficently. Now in a typical thread you have to manually load more than the top comment. It's a mess. Between that and the way the video player/pictures function. It's like the designers don't even use the app that they put together.,2024-03-21

1,"When viewing subreddits you can't load past 200 posts, the page just ends, so if you do top all time you cant view everything on the sub. That on its own is the worst. But I found a loophole, if you make a new account and subscribe to one sub and sort but top all time it works and you can view all of the posts. This worked for me yesterday, today the feed sort option is gone. I'm convinced reddit did this on purpose, they realized what I was doing and removed that as an option. This app sucks.",2024-02-28

Kept daying ""unable yo authenticate"". Are you serious right now? There is ZERO reason why my account should be logged out, and absolutely no reason ehy I should have trouble staying in the app. More ridiculous nonsense breaking the app for no reason.",2024-01-27

4,Amazing brainstormjng creations. I love it though I very new here.,2023-11-02
1,Nothing ruined my reddit experience more than the official reddit app. Ads for alcohol and other harmful things I couldn't care less about despite me letting them personalize my experience. Constant annoying suggestions for subreddits I have no interest in despite me doing my best to hide them. It got to the point where I deleted the app out of frustration and occasionally browse by browser and my life has actually improved from doing so.,2023-12-25

1,Use to love this app until I realized how extremely left wing radicalized it is. Banned from subreddits for having a differing opinion. Was actively attacked for having my own opinion and I was the one banned even though being threatened by other. Ridiculous.,2024-01-22
5,Outstanding,2024-03-20
1,"The app is buggy, difficult to use, and lacks many features that made other readers great. There is no longer such a thing as a curated profile. Reddit is going to push your subscriptions to the bottom of the stack and try to force you into more communities. This, plus the ads, makes it a miserable experience for the user. They didn't change the API rule because they believed in their app. They knew full well 3rd party readers were superior and that they couldn't compete.",2024-01-19

Not going into specifics, because you don't pay me for product testing, but you need to start rolling things back quickly. I can see that you're below 3/5 stars already.

And instead I get a bunch of baloney so I am not keeping this because it was of no help at all I'm not going to chat I'm not paying to ask a question either so you know what if you can't help you can't help and if you just going to make me watch ads and fill up with my phone with a bunch of garbage forget it.,2024-02-10

1,"Reddit's always been a dubious activity but they're openly hostile to users and soon to be public company, now. That pretty much always means they will be selfish and short sighted, devoid of values. That often works out for a strictly transactional relationship, but for free entertainment it only hurt users. The app is garbage meant to take advantage of you, collect your data so they can sell it and redirect your attention for money. Not long for this world. Delete your data while you can.",2024-02-16

1,"The worst app there is. Boost and the others were so good. I don't mind an ad here and there but the devs couldn't be bothered to write a decent enough Algo that at least shows a variety of ads.

5,"Great app! You will find videos here that you won't find elsewhere. So far, they promote free speech, unlike YouTube, Facebook and all if the other apps that you can upload videos and posts. That makes Reddit and Rumble the two big ones for free speech. Crazy that I have to put that in a review in the USA!! But it's true! The other apps remove, ban, shadow-ban, censor.

5,"Lots of entertaining content and conversations, but you get out of it what you put into it. Just like real life, going into a place where you don't belong and talking madness can result in a bad experience. Dip your toes in more general subreddits first, then find places that cater to your special interests.

1,"Since I am now forced to use the official reddit app,I will be honest. It improved. But in terms of accessibility, it's still nowhere near some of the old third party options.

1,"Just bad, don't know why I'm forced download at all, when looking for answer and leads me to a reddit post for that. Instead of allowing view on in browser forcres to download app. Then I run into about 60 to 70% errors of it loading what I'm looking for.

1,"I wish I could give the app 0 stars, it's somehow even worse than last time I edited my review half a year ago. It's slow, buggy, hogs all your power and instead of fixing these issues they forced everyone into using the app anyway by taking away all the alternative Reddit browsers.

1,"Too many advertisements. They're so intrusive, and you can hardly tell them apart from an actual post. Reddit apparently doesn't make enough money off of them, so they decided to drive off third-party apps that did it 10 times better than they did.

4,Good,2024-02-21
4,Good,2024-01-25
2,Nice platform to share and experience whatever interest and hobbies you have. Unfortunately full of mods abusing their power when theyre having bad day or disagree with you. Especially when it comes to politics. Even though you follow and within the guidelines. There's no way to report them. Which unfortunately mostly makes Reddit to an echo chamber.,2023-10-29

1,2/24 update Still the worst version of reddit. Most of the 3 party apps worked better than the official reddit app. It still takes forever to load even Images and has way too many irrelevant ads. The ui is extremely clumsy and it's definitely brought down my use of the website. They made a huge mistake being greedy and destroying the 3 party market that made the platform usable.,2024-02-01

BUT the only thing that bothers me so much is that you can't delete the notifications from inbox, you can only just stop them from coming more but not delete the existing one which is so infuriating and for that and that only i have given this 3 stars bc this is just ridiculous.

4,I met my GF on this app and I wasn't even looking. Got a spare couple of hours? Get lost down the rabbit hole of a subreddit and watch your time melt away. Got an opinion? Post it on Reddit. Got a meme or funny video? Share them with the world on Reddit.,2024-02-21

1,"This app is directly tied to the Google store. Reddit is at its worst. I got banned from r/gaming because the mods are bad. I didn't break the rules, I just made it front page with an overly high earning post. I commented with a second account at r/gaming one day and that counted as ""Ban Invasion"", so I got permanent banned. You can't make a new account even with VPN because the app is tied to Google and that's how they track you. I tried to repeal, but it was denied. Abusive mods and bad app.",2023-11-21

1,Reddit does not allow freedom of speech. The administrators and mods permabanned people that don't agree with their political or personal views. I think it's also not fair that somebody can be completely banned from Reddit for life with no way to make a defense case for themselves. The administrators and moderators have become very power-hungry. I was permanently banned because I reported an abusive biased sub intentionally created to mock gun owners and baselessly attack them.,2023-12-20

Too much censorship and unnecessary restrictions for an app that is supposed to be a place for freedom of speech. It's the app of easily offended people. They will be offended by anything even if it's something so small. Even by just saying you like meat, someone out there will be offended and hate you for liking meat.

1,In the last couple of months this app has degraded into something that is very hard and unpleasant to use. The content is not the issue. The images don't load and the videos take forever to load aswell. It feels like this app isn't maintained or cared about tbh. Which sucks because there is so much on reddit you can find anything you are interested in no matter who you are. All that content means nothing if your app is barely functioning.,2024-02-26

The audio will keep playing while I'm looking at another post, or even after I go to the home screen and open a different app. There is no way to stop it other than killing the app. Video has always been pretty bad with this app in general.

1,Why in the names of the gods does it take several minutes for a TEXT POST to load?? And don't say it's my connection. This is a consistent problem on multiple high speed wifi networks and my mobile network. Never should've killed 3rd party apps.

1,Forgets your settings every time you close the app. Does not load things properly. Terrible UI design. Absolute embarrassment of an app coming from a large company. Solo devs made reddit apps a thousand times better but they killed them all so now we're stuck with this steaming pile of garbage,2024-01-29

1,After update its take lots of time to load fix it,2023-10-30
3,Lack of audio on video clips linked and now you can't even get to the source. Notification pop ups block buttons until it times out. I.e. if you block a suggested sub a popup comes to say its blocked but you can't actually hit a confirm button. Really poor to see no fixes for bugs that should have been found via quality control and now even through community feedback.,2024-02-24
5,"Update(1/8/24)I noticed a lot of bugs have been squished and the pages don't scroll themselves like they used to. However I did notice that sometimes I'll click on the subreddit on the top left corner of the post and for some reason the profile name would pop up instead. Another bug is when I click the comment button and the video would become rectangular on the top of the screen but the rest of the page would be gray.**A third bug is when subreddits I've already joined say ""join"" on main page.",2024-01-08

1,"Annoying. I don't even understand why you need an app. It's a forum! I'd 100% rather just use my browser. If I do though, they have to remind me EVERYTIME that there is an app. Get the app, then they start spamming you with random threads. Please just make this a website. Having a whole app for a message board that already works fine in a browser, is like getting in your car to go from your living room to your kitchen. Why?! It's so you can data mine us. This app in NO way benefits the user.",2024-03-23

Reddit refuses to do something about it for years but call themselves committed to accessibility. Tech is supposed to make life easier, not worse - and this is such a basic thing.

Even though the largest font is chosen on my tab, it's still hard to follow the text from left to right. Also, the app's is fixed on portrait orientation, yet photos can be view in landscape mode. Maybe the app could somewhat replicate the desktop site. Have a wonderful day!",2024-03-30

1,"Whole threads close as you scroll because of a feature they implemented to click close comments. Happens way too frequently. Also makes it impossible to copy the body of a comment, and impossible to click into a person's profile. It's bad, and the promoted content is pretty obtrusive.

1,"This would have been 5 stars, reddit is an incredible community with great content, the new update however completely messed with the UI, usability, load times and ease of use. Whenever I click an image it freezes the entire app, if it loads without crashing the app, the image sometimes is pure white. Sometimes opening comment threads crashes the app and so does simply scrolling. There is way too much unused white space. I'll redo this review when this is resolved.

2,"Pretty poor app. Any development work and updates are focused on harvesting data and money for reddit. It doesn't even support landscape mode. Given it's a media app, that's a significant drawback. It's buggier than it should be given how long it's been around.",2024-02-10
5,Absolutely badass!!,2023-11-02
2,Keeps asking me to rate the app when I did.,2024-01-10
1,"Hate the update. Hate the overwhelming amount of bots that Reddit does nothing about. Hate the owners of Reddit for selling out and cheapening their once great product. It's no longer the front page of the internet but the CCP propaganda highway ever since they bought out Reddit. 3.24.24 the latest update is beyond frustrating. Can't read ""more"" in a pic without it taking you to the comments instead of expanding the info. Stupid fks as mods and owners. Can't use the back button on you phone now.",2024-03-24
5,"Something for everyone. Limitless, interesting content without the typical social media drama.",2023-11-10

1,"Banned for literally no reason... States account has been permanently banned for content from other connected accounts. Doesn't state what post or content caused this. Only posted a fortnite clip in a group. No nsfw content, no religion, no political stuff. So what's the problem?",2023-12-16

1,"App has declined in quality across the board to nearly #0 on everything. All 3rd Party apps are gone. If you're interested in Reddit, find something else, and stick to that. Don't bother using this application nor website. Whoever is making the current decisions, I hope you lose everything, in a financial sense. Legendary known app is dead to me.

3,I don't understand why there is no simple in app sharing feature and why I can't scroll endlessly without it being stopped after 6 posts.,2024-01-28
1,"There's a lot of improvements to be made. Try using the ""reddit is fun"" app for inspiration. I'll be using it until you improve your app. (I wrote this in 2016 and the app still sucks and has a bunch of bugs and glitches. It's crazy to me that this app is still so bad after all this time, too bad to there's no more competition for them so there's no real reason to improve the app.)",2024-02-12
5,I grew tired of Facebook and wanted a more topic-specific format.,2024-02-23
4,"I have one feature request: When ever I come back to the app, instead of it being reset back to the main page I would like the app to remember and ask whether I would like to continue reading the thread that was previously open.",2024-03-19

1,"It seems to be impossible to permanently disable the Reddit Recap pop-up, which means there's a randomly-appearing orange button overlaying the lower right of the app that partially blocks posts. Good thing Reddit killed off third party apps so that I could get blasted with an orange button every time I want to look at my feed.",2023-12-21

5,Better than Facebook Twitter Pinterest etc,2024-03-21
1,How did you manage to update this terrible app and make it worse? Now tapping a picture or gif brings up the comment section. Why? You literally have a comment button for that. Tapping the post used to make it full screen Go find the people that made quality apps for reddit before you shut them down and ask them nicely to help you.,2024-01-31
5,Its all around fun and enjoyable,2024-02-26
1,I would be a lot happier with the app if they respected hide and block requests. I keep getting notifications for a group that I am not a member of and I have selected both hide and block for it and still get notified on it...,2023-11-02

1,"The big issue is that it doesn't let me scroll to the side on the homepage after about 10 to 20 posts and then when I try to back out of the app it sends me back to the top. So it's all the posts I've already managed to scroll through. I reinstalled and cleared the cache and it still sucks. Every time it's updated it still sucks, so I will continue to update this review with that date. 3/18/24.",2024-03-19

1,"Missing the vast majority of features and customization that other Reddit apps offered. Ads are hidden throughout the frontpage and many of the ads are offensive, but there's no way to hide or block them. If you're looking for a healthy social media site, this isn't the one. Edit: The app crashes daily. It isn't capable of handling comment chains that are nested too deep. Occasionally, the audio from a video you scroll past will get stuck playing, requiring a restart. Devs have poor direction.",2023-11-21

Now they're just powertripping, saying until I grovel, my ban is permanent. Now they muted me for 28 days. Ridiculous mods think they're all powerful.

2,"The frequency of lost content is difficult to tolerate. I was writing a verbose comment and switched apps on my phone to copy/paste a URL into my comment and, when I went back to Reddit, it had deleted my comment and put me back on the home screen. It could have been because of an app update, but it goes to emphasize that our content is not prioritized. If I'm writing an email or a note in other apps, it's saving the state automatically as I type, which also makes it resilient. Not Reddit.",2024-01-07

Videos/ video audio keep playing long after they were on the screen. Some audio will keep playing even after I jump to a new page. Ad volume is obnoxious. Swiping on posts with multiple pictures regularly changes the entire page instead of just the picture. There are no longer any third-party app options, and this is what we're left with?",2024-03-27

1,"Heck. For years now, the infinite scroll feature (where you can just swipe between posts) had been bugging out *eventually*, but instead of fixing it, it's somehow gotten worse? After killing third party apps, the expectations from the native app were raised. Instead of rising to the occasion, Reddit slapped the bar from your hand and stomped on it while flipping you the bird.

4,good,2023-11-18
3,It's a great app to browse around. But to try to post anything in any of the communities (that I tried) is an unbelievably complicated ritual riddled with rules and regulations.

1,Easily one of the developers on the app store removing functionalities from the app. I used to be able to sort my home page but they have since removed it or moved it behind so many menus that you'd think you need a CS degree to figure out the terrible UI.

1,What happened to good ui design? Redundant menu options just barely make any sense. Swiping down from an image takes you to the post and up takes you away even tho it's the opposite flow people follow scrolling through posts. Left and right move between posts even if you're swiping through a collection of images. Notifications overlapping menu options is bad practice. Downloading should always be in the same place but everything has different flows for downloading. Not coming back til its fixed,2024-01-28

1,"Edit: Wow, does this app keep getting worse. If I could rate negatives, I would. I was randomly signed out in the middle of browsing and when attempting to log back in, somehow it forgot that my email was already in use, and created a new account. Now I can't switch accounts, nor can I delete the new random account because the app refuses to load the settings. Amazing.

If the first party reddit app wasn't so bad we wouldn't need third party apps in the first place. 2-4-2024 Edit: The app is so slow that its faster to copy the link & open it in firefox than wait for it to load, & it keeps asking if ""I want to share the link instead"" when I take a screenshot.",2024-02-04

It constantly stutters despite having a good phone, it plays audios for videos that aren't even on my screen, it finds a way to make comment scrolling a choppy, buggy mess. This app sucks.

Like maybe 10% of what's on there is fun. But mostly I'm just like what? Also at least once a day they have an issue where either the comments won't load or the app itself won't load.

Also since these 'things' appeared app keeps stopping and i can not achieve what i want to do. App is now unusable and at best extremly time consuming and unreliable.

The ""He Gets Us"" ads for example are so annoying and unlike any of the Meta apps or TikTok, Reddit doesn't let you choose to stop showing certains ads. Edit: Now I have ANOTHER issue where the Call of Duty ad keeps playing with audio on. No other video does this and I have no way to hide the ad. No way to report the issue either. After getting a response from the developer, I am still getting the same ads. Has even ramped up since the Superbowl.",2024-02-15

1,"This app is a nightmare for navigation. It lacks basic features like seeing feeds from followed subreddits. 3rd party apps solved this issue. You removed them because of greed.

1,The stupid bounding snoo face while the app struggles or fails to load anything is the most annoying change yet. This app sucks. They killed third party app access and we're left with this trash. Garbage app. Garbage admin running it. The top post in every subreddit is an ad. They hide ads to look like user-submitted links. The worst option for browsing reddit. Even using a mobile web browser is better than this trash app.,2024-01-26

1,Updated 2/4/24 Would love to give this app less than 1 Star. The moderators really ruined the creativity behind the app community.

1,There's no reason not to have font size controls that are separate from the OS settings. The size of text in the OS is not indicative of the tiny text in this app. It's an accessibility issue that could be easily resolved.,2024-02-05
5,Very reliable app when seeking information on pretty much any subject. People can get tangled up in conflict rather than sharing their opinions yet the threads don't always follow suit which is refreshing.

Reddit single-handedly destroyed all 3rd party apps just to give us this POS. So many ads disguised as posts, as well as 'suggested for you' posts.

To add to my review sometimes while reading comments it acts as though I've tapped on a new post just to show me a single comment when I just touch the screen trying to scroll through the replies.

When I receive a notification I choose ""hide community"" it responds ""community updates turned off"" then still get them.

1,"Hard to believe they killed third party apps for this garbage. F spez. Sucks in every measurable metric compared to apps like rif. Player never loads quickly, always buffering - when video is about to start, when video starts, when video has started, when you try to skip ahead or behind, etc etc Disgusting behavior from Reddit, emphasizing they do not care if the user experience is hot trash if they can eek out a few cents here and there. We'll see how long it can last at this rate",2023-12-28

1,"Reddit is using political censorship. They suspended my account for using the word 'genocide' to describe the killing of 20,000 people. I appealed this very blatant censorship, and they rejected that on an obviously nonsense claim that this description was an 'incitement to violence'. I've used reddit for 13 years with nothing but positive contributions. Reddit is compromised by pro-Israel propagandists.",2023-11-29

1,"New development, reddit app randomly opens ad posts behind others. I'll click a reddit text link and hear an invisible ad. Thanks reddit, your app is unreasonably bad.

5,"It's reddit, IYKYK.",2023-11-17
1,This app sucks honestly. Doesn't let you change default sort order for home page. Redownloaded just to leave this review. Banning third party apps might have gone over better if they weren't better in every way,2024-03-12

5,"Excellent app, lots of subreddits with interesting topics. However, I would encourage Reddit to adopt Elon Musk's more tolerant censorship approach or, even better, simply follow the law; if the post does not violate the First Amendment, it should not be taken down by Reddit. I was unhappy to hear that Reddit had banned r/TheDonald previously, and I hope your company and other tech companies will not engage in any similar behaviors in future, particularly with the 2024 election around the corner",2024-01-04

1,"The clown mods over at reddit don't like hearing truth and fact presented when it counters their fragile little brain's beliefs. They'd rather violate your 1st amendment right to free speech than allow you to speak freely. This used to be a dumping ground for people to speak their minds, now it's a PC hell that people are too stupid to see and realize. The various mods and leadership of reddit deserve to be shot for their despotic control of this site now. Leave this cancer to the ignorant ones.",2023-11-06

3,It's getting slow.,2024-01-18
2,My Favourite this one than Quora doesn't do post it No hope getting money from me. Stop blanking me off and stop band me out the Reddit is already annoying so I hate Reddit for that and stop telling me off do over again,2024-03-29

5,I love Reddit and the app.,2024-03-05
1,I am not sure what they are doing but it went from a dumpster fire of an app to an all out garbage dump inferno. My usage of Reddit has gone down at least 85-90% since forcing their party apps to shutdown and it's all due to your horrible app.,2023-12-04
5,Amazing app I am loving it,2024-01-25

1,Well earlier today couldn't have went any better loved the app from this coming from a dumb plow ranch idiot who is low tech but I couldn't wait until I could get back onto the site while ago only to find out the lack of a say safe app for your information leave a message they do diddly dog poop üí©..,2024-01-16
1,"An absolutely garbage experience. It is a cesspool that will allow porn, gore, and child grooming and yet punish people who have opposite opinions. The power tripping moderators tend to manage many other sub reddits and it makes the whole app into some kind of echo chamber with no real conversations happening. There are few subreddits you can find that are normal but the majority of it is sickening. If you have a child on this app I would heavily monitor it just not allow them to be on it",2023-12-11
1,"They allow moderators to push terrorist propaganda, antisemitism, and ban people who speak out against it.",2024-03-07
5,Good,2024-02-22
1,"It's ironic, but the Reddit app for Reddit kind of sucks IMHO. I wanted to like it, but it kept throwing up irrelevant unwanted Reddit notifications even after I configured it not to suggest anything and also explicitly blocked notifications for r/HuntsvilleAlabama, which is the reddit that I kept seeing. I have no interest in Huntsville Alabama and I don't know why Reddit started notifying me of posts in that subReddit. I finally wound up deleting the Reddit app and installed Atom instead.",2023-12-17
1,Every update it gets worse,2023-11-21
3,I can't see how many upvotes any of my posts have. I feel like the mobile layout is much easier to navigate.,2024-01-28
3,"My biggest gripe is the app takes forever to load posts even on WiFi, it fairly often will get stuck on the Reddit icon when you first boot it up and if you close the app it'll log you out so you have to re-sign in. Also the app takes up well over a gig of space which seems a bit excessive to me",2023-11-07
5,Nice,2023-12-05
5,Great cannabis community.,2024-03-20
1,Once a great app is now in a downwards spiral. I wish I could offer a single problem. There are too many. The user interface and rewards system disappeared. Paying premium with nothing premium in return. So sad.,2023-11-12

5,"Always find great info, althoughnsome comments can be snarky.",2024-02-26
1,"It's beyond stupid that you don't have the option to sort through your most upvoted comments on the app, if you want someone to use an app for your social media site then you need to offer at least the basic features that are available on the desktop version App is a broken buggy mess, after all these years it's still terrible",2023-12-25

1,"Scrolling through the app is laggy. It makes me feel like iam using my device below 60 hertz. It's video player is very basic, doesn't play videos sometimes. My biggest regret is only knowing about the Third party apps untill Reddit decided to kill the support for it. Like Relay and Sync were unimaginably better than this GARBAGE. Idk what even gets fixed with their updates. If the Reddit team has any shame left, fix your Garbage of an app. Stop adding Bananas and fix it for god sake..",2024-01-03

1,"While I don't personally use any of the 3rd party apps, I don't support big companies forcing indie developers into paying ridiculous prices. Developer that are open to paying reddit reasonable prices. Even without using the other apps, I know reddit is about to get way worse as mods are unable to do their job, bots go away, etc etc. Sad to see it go, and hope that reddit makes a change.",2024-03-28

5,Good dog.,2024-03-13
1,A bad app for a bad company. Reddit is more interested in its shareholders than it's users.,2024-02-02
5,Satisfied so far,2023-11-17
1,"Very bad glitches. Automatically started tagging all my posts as NSFW when they were completely alright. The recent update was more whack, eachtime I try to write a comment, the app crashes.",2023-12-06
3,"The navigation in the app is rather odd. I regularly end up in unexpected places. Also I REALLY hate the way the app pushes subreddits that I have no interest in. I understand the need for advertising, but the subreddit promotion is distracting and annoying .",2023-12-10

5,üòçüòéüíòüëçü§†üëç,2023-11-15
1,"Limited options for basic functions like making the display text bigger for accessibility (you have to change your SYSTEM settings to make the text bigger..... assinine). RedditIsFun was better in every way. Devs waste their resources to add features that retract from quality of user experience, like the recent stupid swipe and drag thing which just adds more steps to view content, and can't code in the simplest QOL features like accessibility (literally let me make the text larger)",2024-02-11
2,"Lacks the many features I used to enjoy with Slide for Reddit. Considering this app is developed and maintained by reddit itself, it's a hot mess of an app.",2023-11-02

4,Trying to open pictures is god awful.,2023-10-29
2,No landscape mode on a tablet or better navigation. Too many ads. Too many sponsored or suggested posts. 50% of my feed is content I didn't ask to see.,2023-12-05
1,"Why are you putting ads for Jesus on my posts? That's a bold and annoying assumption. Why can't you zoom in on videos yet? Way too many ads. Overall, just a terrible design. If you are going to cut off RIF, at least attempt to be almost as good. Extremely frustrating to sort or filter what I see. it's a bad way to see your saved subreddits in one feed. I want to see top, new, popular, and filter specific time frames such as ALL or in the last week, for just the subs I follow. Try being better",2024-03-16
1,Removed due to lack of features and poor stability. Basically had to ditch the whole site thanks to their recent API access changes. Fun while it lasted.,2023-11-30

1,Reddit hates free speech and will remove stories and ban users when content doesn't violate their policies but instead if the content violates Reddit's political ideology.,2023-11-07
1,Forcing app to shut down because you want more money is a choice. I still will not use this horrible app. You know why user like others app. I'm questioning my use of reddit in general tbh. Redreader in the meantime is enough.,2023-12-14

I don't want to watch the video so I click the video to try and pause it. The video then fills my entire screen. Now I can pause the video. Then I click back to get back to the comments.

5,A great app. No adverse comments to make.,2023-11-05
1,"You have to download their app to view most anything, can't just look at it on chrome. It basically forces you to make an account. You view one subreddit ONE time and it shows you posts from it for the rest of time, and says ""Oops something went wrong!"" every time you try to mute that subreddit or stop showing posts from it, so you never stop seeing them. The users are all incredibly toxic. Honestly, I don't have anything positive to say. I wish this wasn't the only big public forum online.",2024-02-09

It filled my head with negative imagery and thoughts. I wasn't taking care of my daily tasks. I wasn't brainstorming about something to do anymore. It turned into an addiction very quickly. Probably because I'm alone. Within two weeks I deleted it from my life. I'm relieved it's gone and now I can get on with it.,2024-02-22

Basically, you get karma for every ""like"" you get. The problem is, some subreddits have this stupid idea of immediately banning any comment tha has got less than *insert number* of karma. How am I supposed to raise karma if my posts aren't seen by anyone and my comments are deleted 'cause of my low karma? It's a vicious cycle",2024-01-23

Content density is very low - usually 3 posts on screen at a time while 1 of every 5 is an ad...

1,This app is the worst. It keeps showing me subreddits for people in fast food jobs and people who rent. It shows very few subreddits that I actually follow. I guess they want me to feel bad for $14 an hour workers who now have to pay rent for their cat. I miss my old 3rd party app.,2023-12-13

They really should have just continued allowing third party apps though, as sync was faster and has an ad-free option.

Given the app started as third party it's kinda bad they choose this route.",2023-12-14

1,App sucks they randomly ban accounts for suppposed breaking of their rules and content. There is no human being to appeal the ban to ot Is all ai.

But recently just now it says I can't upload my pixel art images because it says my image should be at least by 20 pixels. I don't understand why they have to add this inconvenience. I used to post many pixel art posts and I simply just can't because of this change. Please may you find this post and perform some adjustments to the app so I can enjoy it. Thank you",2024-03-24

When they switched to charge for the API usage and killed all the third party apps, I was stuck using this app. It's ok, but the thing that I hate is that it doesn't allow me to sort my main feed by ""hot"". It defaults to ""best"" from what I understand. The problem with that is that I only see the more obscure subreddits that I've subscribed to. That's not super useful. So I've started using Insta",2023-11-16

If you are going to ban 3rd party apps, make a better product yourself.",2023-12-05
2,Biggest grievance is the horrendous UX. You can't cycle a carousel without it changing what you're looking at. Why have 2 different behaviours for the same swipe.

How is it an issue with Reddit? It's the only app that does it, out of over 100 that I have installed. Took me a few weeks to realise it's your app's fault! Can't even use a different Reddit client because you broke that too!",2024-02-27

1,Absolutely devoid of any of the polish or coziness offered by the third-party apps they effectively shut down last year. I literally quit reddit instead of using this garbage and I've convinced many friends to do the same.,2024-01-15
5,I wasn't a fan of it originally but it has grown on me,2024-03-21
5,Love it,2024-01-16
1,Can't view profiles. Side menu doesn't work at all. Can't save anything. Can't add subs to your categories. Changing any options don't save. Give the app back to third-party developers so the grown-ups can do your job correctly.,2024-02-12

1,I CANNOT SUBMIT A COMMENT EVEN THOUGH I JUST OPENED THIS APP,2024-01-12
5,The update is horrible. Now I have nothing and even if it loads it'll be from a few days ago with no update and everything is blank. Fix this please. Edit 12/16/23 the updates worked and now loading time is much faster but the only problem is scrolling posts while reading threads that it locks after 10 and you have to go back to the main screen to resume scrolling through posts.,2023-12-16

1,"Dear, whatever holy power you believe in. Why does reddit suck so bad now? Are people really this insane and frankly downright stupid?

Mostly just people jumping on popular bandwagons with real conversations being far and few in-between. I also love how reddit has responded to comments about ads autoplaying. Considering that goes back months and they still haven't fixed, that's not a bug - it's a feature for the advertisements. And a lie at this point.",2024-02-02

1,"The app looked good already okay. They rounded the corners of posts (looks bad) and now you don't immediately see who posted the thing, but after you click on it.

1,They intentionally drove 3rd party apps out of business so they could force everyone to use this ad filled piece of garage. Quite literally every 2nd or 3rd part is either a promoted ad post or showing me a post I don't care about from a subreddit I don't even follow because it for some reason thinks I would want to see it. Just let me see the subreddits I actually follow.,2023-12-15
1,"App downloads, tired to open it and it's just a black screen. I waited 20 minutes, nothing ever happened. Terrible app.",2024-02-12

1,"I too have to change my rating because it's pretty annoying. Since a few weeks the app is so slow, the pictures take minutes for loading or after a few scrolls the pictures arent loading at all. it make no difference whether I'm using LTE or my wifi at home.

2,"The moderators ban you from subs for posts that ""breaks"" rules that I obviously have nothing to do with this is another app they attack you if your gay or conservative or whatever stuff you post on... you'll get banned from the gardening sub every week",2024-01-03
5,When I need to figure out how to repair something and can't find information anywhere else this is the app I go to always has what I need.,2023-11-25
1,Somehow this app gets worse after every update. Clicking view all comments actually just refreshes the page and sends you back to the top making live threads impossible to follow.,2024-01-21
2,Ads have sound on by default. Battery drains fast with new update. Videos play audio from other posts or ads when you view comments on one post.,2023-11-06
5,"Very entertaining and even educational, and always eye opening. One of my favorite apps. You can actually be real with people, and they don't get offended. Plus, it's real answers to real questions. I love it",2024-03-15

1,Missing so many features the third party apps had. User interface is unintuitive. I enjoyed Reddit but now will likely only view the odd time since the first party app is just not enough. Add super intrusive.,2023-11-13
4,Great Sources of Non-Disinformation!,2023-12-04
1,- Terrible UI design as if not even thinking of placement or convenience - External source integration is slow and broken in places (can't open YouTube app or trigger fullscreen on the inbuilt YouTube interface) - Aggressive levels of content suggestion overtakes the feed and is indistinguishable from YOUR content - No visual distinction for viewed posts - Laggy feed and inputs - Can't edit custom feeds API cost forced me here from amazing 3rd party app. Likely delete soon.,2024-01-22
5,Awesome info app,2024-03-09
1,"I USED to love Reddit and now I can't use the interface without going to the web page. Apparently with Reddit's current app version, Android users can no longer authenticate in the app. It's pretty much useless to have an account at this point.",2024-03-22

1,Zero stars Used to be great. The last few months it's gone completely downhill. It shouldn't even get one star as one star implies something is okay when in fact nothing about Reddit is good. There is a duality on this site where in some subs you can promote hate but other subs will site wide ban you for a dirty joke,2024-03-19

2,"Gifs stopped working, whenever I'm typing a comment, open another app and return to reddit, it sends me to some random post and deletes the comment I was making. Frequently the task bar to return to home, chat, create etc. disappears until you reset the app. Settings for ordering of comments resets many times when I close the app, and there's an issue of comments processing twice over or not at all and deleting your message meaning you have to start again. Core is good just poor execution.",2024-03-05

1,Garbage app. Bring back the free api or make the pricing way more affordable for 3rd party Devs. UI doesn't make sense compared to Baconreader. search function is barely useable just like the site.

It also will not show an entire comment chain once there are enough replies when accessed by clicking on a notification. I can't see my reply to a comment once I reclick the notification.

1,"The official app sucks. Not even getting into the 3rd party API stuff and focus just on this app, it still sucks.

5,The only safe social media site that exists. It's the most secure social media app because the way it's set up; you don't click links accidently while scrolling and get malware and have to factory reset all the time. I quit all my other social media apps because I kept clicking on malicious links while scrolling. Yours is still so I'm in control and and links have no web preview so they're easy to dodge. That's the best concept for cyber security! Kudos!üôåüèª,2024-03-28

2,Lel app getting progressively worse,2023-11-04
1,Swamped with annoying seamless ads. The video player is garbage. Ugh!!!!!!! The whole thing. The UI is full of nonsense flare. I seem to keep seeing the same few sub reddits over a mix of my hundreds.,2023-11-01

5,Great videos+ info üíô,2024-01-29
2,"So much to dislike about this app, the list is quite extensive! First, why is the default function isn't open comments when clicking on a post? What about the data usage? Not everyone has a fiber line. Second, how bulky and unintuitive the UI is, you can barely make out most basic functions, the theme is garbage and the button and UI layout is just not pleasing or make sense. And lastly NSFW, you must be actually dumb to put a nsfw warning, maybe check the status and see what users are browsing",2023-11-20
4,"Great app. Usability has minor issues (big and small left/right swipes) and notification settings are all-or-none in some categories, but nothing horrible. Well-made!",2024-03-19

5,Great app,2023-12-20
1,"Constantly making their website worse to try to force me into their app. ""Oh did you click on the picture and not the text? Don't worry you can click this link to the post! (Ha! Got you, now you're in the app store!) Enjoy your 1 star review.",2023-11-07
1,"The app is really hard to navigate. Also, Reddit is an incredibly toxic place. If you don't agree with the majority of any sub they brand you as evil and ban you. Nobody should use Reddit.",2024-02-24
1,1 star for forcing people to use your app to view a website. Way to ruin a good thing.,2024-01-24

1,no optimisation for the tablets screen or folding phones,2023-11-23

1,"This app is being pushed as the only alternative to the browser version of the website, which is being ran into the dirt because ""advertisers."" Reddit's new web design and browser are trash. This app is garbage. The entire Reddit experience the last couple of years has been purely abhorrent. I don't want ads. I don't want your terrible video player. I want to be able to see the pictures I'm trying to load, not a tiny preview. Fire your UI and web designers.",2023-12-20
4,Enjoyable posts over specific subjects.,2024-02-09

1,"Toxic people with huge egos, biggits, extreme censorship, racests, sexists, close minded people, the site is buggy, I hate it now. Avoid at all costs. Doesn't matter if you're liberal, woke or the other political ways of being this site and app isn't healthy for anyone!",2023-10-31

1,"When I write comment and click on post button sometime it's show me a message to wait 5min or 10 min before posting comments, several time I click on post each time it show me that message. It is very irritating and reddit should fix it",2024-01-30

5,Great.,2023-11-03
5,"Amazing $hit posts, fun to read",2023-11-15
4,Honestly I've found it a good alternative to other shortform media platforms since if you click on a video you can scroll. The algorithm could be better but the advantage of it being hands-off (ie terrible) is you mainly get videos from subreddits you've joined.,2024-03-23
5,I am posting because they were repeatedly asking me to post.,2024-01-10

1,"Author keeps changing the app for the worse. Used to be nice way to browse Reddit some years back, not anymore. Lot of UI/UX changes that doesn't make sense, are not configurable and just flat out suck, interaction flow is hideous. With latest version the app crashes on commenting or replying, which makes this app useless piece of garbage and just shows how little they care or test new versions before rollout.",2023-12-05

5,I am rating this five stars just to spite the various would be ivy league bast*rd mods who ruined SEVERAL subreddits during their pathetic protest How much of an ego must they have to take advantage of the blind for their own selfish gain? It's clear MAJORITY wanted no part in their ego stroking power trip. How I laughed when their efforts were torn by the great silent majority of users who were tired of their tyrannical selfish actions and just wanted their subs back.,2023-12-30

1,Literally the worst app in the play store. I love how when you tell the app to stop showing content from a certain subreddit it will still continue to push that content.

5,Informative and entertaining,2023-11-15
4,Sometimes there are too many notifications for things that are of very little or no interest to me. I also continue to get notifications from unsubbed communities.

2,"It's a decent app but there's a feature that ruins it for me. On Android, if you visit the app through a Google link, then hit back on your device, instead of going back to the search results, the app just takes you back through all the reddit pages you previously had open. This makes browsing Google pages really annoying, I may delete so I can go back to normal web browsing, but they have made that difficult too. Why is there no good way to do this?",2024-03-04

New Edit 07/11/2023 : The app has now gotten even worse, previously it was atleast fast, but now after clicking on every post it just loads and loads and after viewing the post if we go back the page starts to reload the whole page or subreddit to display content.

1,"This app fell off of a dump truck and into the google play store. I used to use Reddit Is Fun for over a decade until I was forced to start using the default reddit app earlier this year, and my conclusion is that this app sucks. It auto plays fight videos and nsfw content without clicking on it. It frequently recommends posts from subs I have absolutely no interest in. It can't even save drafts of comments. Garbage app from a trash development team.",2023-12-27
5,It is an excellent App. Thanks Reddit,2023-12-20
2,"This application is loaded with burner accounts! Also contains sports gambling advertisements! I have downvoted the same advertisements & Reddit still won't stop recommending them to me.

3,"Explanations are needed. For example, Flair. I know the dictionary definition, I don't understand how it's used on Reddit, especially when it's part of what's required in order to finish creating or responding to a post. My first avatar creation saved just fine. Two years later, it disappeared. Now, the free avatar creation will neither allow me to save nor will it tell me what I need to do so I can save it. Many similar items could use attention to increase ease of use and user satisfaction.",2024-03-13

1,You can't post/comment on most threads because you don't have karma. You can only get karma by posting in threads. Also they actively work to sell your data,2024-02-20
1,First they kill all the good apps so I have to settle for their official app which months later still hasn't gotten close to catching up. Now they release an update that crashes the app everytime I try to make a comment. So I guess that must be a good sign Reddit doesn't want me around anymore.,2023-12-05

4,"It's by far the best social app. Not perfect any means: specifically, the reliance on volunteer mods and lack of moderation consistency across Reddits are both positive and negative.

1,"Edit 4: What has happened here? Style changes, bugs making the app unusable... Edit 3: It's pretty much unusable as about 90% of times the app shows an infinite loading screen or blackscreen on opening. Edit 2: Using r/place to regain popularity, but the api changes, bots, ads and bugs make the platform less and less attractive. Edit: Sometimes it doesn't load any posts, sometimes it crashes.

1,"This app is sad. It's a leftist echo chamber, where if you differ in opinion even slightly you're banned and/or attacked. Used to be a pretty decent app/website to find cool niech community to talk about any and everything. Now every sub is super political and I spend most time on non political subs because everything else is political. Find something else to browse unless you just need a quick answer. I wouldn't spend any amount of time on this site or you'll become an abomination aka redditor.",2024-01-10
1,"The app functions okay, but the platform is pathetic. It is comprised of moderators who suffer from ""little Napoleon complex"" who get you suspended for anything you post.

Update: 2 weeks in of trying to like this (cr)app, but it's just terrible. No setting changes can fix it, it just sucks. Update Oct 2023: Still trash, truly.

2,"Reddit is fun was a great app, it worked well. It flowed well. It actually opened up the reddit link you clicked on, unlike the official app that just opens. Then, you have to go back to the original link and click it a second time to get to it.",2023-11-01

1,Terrible,2023-11-17
3,"It used to be better, some of the new changes are pretty pointless, and reminds me of FB. If you set it not to give you notices for certain subs, you get them anyway. Many of the mods are on power trips and behave illogically, especially when it comes to sub rules they themselves don't follow. If you use a VPN, you get a notice during sign in that you need to click on a link to get onto the site. When will social media websites learn that web surfing with a VPN is about security?",2024-01-12
5,Nice,2023-12-19
5,I ask reddit as if it was my best friend who I can count on to give me the honest truth or opinions on anything. The users comments are nearly always genuinely concerned or hilarious. Not a place for trolls to hand out. For whatever reason trolls don't seem to comment on reddit. Maybe bc it's a voting platform for the serious people seeking serious questions ‚ùìü§î I don't know what Id do in the age of technology and science without my family on Reddit. It's probably also saved many lives of pets!,2024-01-28

Basically I'll hit paywalls when I'm already subscribed to a news service in this app. It also won't open YouTube videos in the YouTube app, because it uses the in-app browser.

1,It's so freaking annoying having to download the app in order to view NSFW content that's tagged as 18+that isn't even REMOTELY related to NSFW. Seriously people? Stop tagging NSFW content that doesn't even come close to falling into the realm of 18+. Freaking ridiculous.,2024-01-31
1,"The new UI is subpar at best. It is extremely unintuitive and casually forces you to the top of your feed, showing you the same posts you saw a minute ago again. With Reddit cracking down on APIs and other 3rd party apps, this piece of garbage is basically the only way to access Reddit. Either make the 1st party app usable, or give us an option to use something else rather than this 5-times recycled soggy paper-straw BS. More than half of my home feed is irrelevant suggestions for other subs.",2024-01-25

1,"The app is bad man. It used to work fine, but it keeps getting worse in design. Not to mention Everytime you want to see the full image of a post you gotta open up the full post instead of how it used to be. Just make a functional app",2023-11-17
5,Cool,2024-01-02

The following is a list of features from my preferred app that I pay to use, Relay for Reddit -When opening a link from a Google search, official app doesn't immediately swap back to the search. -No option to hide viewed posts -Constantly changing gestures -Bots, ads, and not showing posts from subreddits I follow.

1,"Absolutely incompetent admin team, they can't tell the difference between defending your point and harassment, it's a simple argument, neither i nor the other person were harassing each other. They only look at reports- and even if you actually appeal or try to get your things unremoved, they'll simply act as if they did something and send you an automated message, practically not giving a damn. Also, they literally let their bots, that don't seem to be calibrated forüí© do basically all the work",2023-12-05

1,So poorly made it's sad. Scrolling up and down between posts takes 5+ swipes and forget if someone posts multiple pictures And you want to look through them. I do not know how it's possible but it only registers maybe 1/10th of every swipe made so going vertically it barely moves and when trying to look at pictures you see it move a little and just jump back to the same one.

3,The interface and threads are terrible and dated but the community is fantastic. I've solved so many tech issues and helped others to solve theirs.,2024-03-20

1,"Still an awful, laggy and painful UI",2023-12-17
2,Spez is ruining it.,2023-11-25
1,"App is hard to use, swiping on pictures changes feed instead about half the time and without obvious reason. Now takes extra clicks to move back from a post and videos replay incessantly. They also removed reactions/gold which has made the site far less fun. Did Musk buy this site too?",2024-03-20
5,"it's a fun app,people are pretty nice, and i love the sense of community.",2024-02-22

Here's a tip try to stay off of r/anarchychess and r/minecrafthmm Thank you for reading this, and have a nice day.",2023-11-08
1,Can't mute communities. Get an error every time I try. Try to do it on the website? Website insists you use the app instead. Honestly it gets one star just for insisting so hard.,2023-12-10
1,It's been pretty buggy lately,2024-03-18

5,Neat,2023-11-04
5,good,2023-11-24
1,3rd party was better. The amount of ads and unwanted subreddits thrown at my face make it worse than Facebook sometimes honestly I've been looking for something better for a while now but it's been overtaken by lower IQ users and it's useless now.,2024-02-22
1,"Whenever I want to browse something or see something that's unreviewed or even slightly NSFW, they force me into installing this app every time. Why can't I just view it on the website, they don't do this for PC, as they don't have an app for that, so just because you have one for phone, shouldn't mean you force people into downloading it, when it's the same, or even worse than the website.",2024-03-27
5,Keep it up developers good updates and good all the time I gave you guys a five star because the app is just too good but you need to add texting and stories and other stuff like that and calling imaging all those things on Reddit it would be weird wouldn't itü•∏,2024-02-25

5,It's too good üëç,2023-11-02
1,"When forced to use this trashapp going from browser to app, it does not directly link to the message chain in the app. An insane waste of time. If someone forces me to ""open the app"" from a browser, it should take me directly to the thread I was reviewing on the Internet browser and directly open it in the app, seamlessly. But instead I just immediately closed the app, uninstalled. I wonder how many users you are losing because people are unwilling to use a terrible app to navigate Reddit....",2023-11-03
5,Reddit is the reason i pay for internet,2024-01-20

1,"Stop suggesting garbage that is vaguely related to something I looked at one time. I'm subscribed to the state sub for where I grew up and where I live. So this app will suggest every other state sub as ""similar."" Half of my feed is this nonsense. I can't believe Reddit killed the party apps instead of buying out any of them, because they were all better than this one.",2024-02-25

1,"The MODs of this app are the worst and won't allow free speech. Whats the point if a ""social app"" if you cant even express your opinion. Total garbage.",2024-01-03
5,"For the past few days my reddit will not work off my data. Facebook, instagram, Twitter, and youtube all work just fine but those 2. And the only way the app will work is if I use Wi-Fi. A bit odd I guess since my other apps i use my data just fine",2024-03-08
1,Overall great app but i turned obese,2024-03-30

1,"Have had a bug for about an entire YEAR now, after scrolling just a couple posts I can longer keep scrolling. At least it helps with screen on time. No fix out there has worked. I've tried them all",2024-01-22
3,One of the best platform but still there are some bugs that should be fixed as soon as possible. I was able to find some communities that I was not able to find on any other social media platforms. Thank you developers. But please fix the bugs as soon as possible.,2023-11-24

1,Who in their right mind approved the icon overhaul!! It's atrocious!!! Not even a professional look. And I'm surely not the only one thinking this. It looks like a child's lunchbox stickers!!!,2023-12-06
1,Why is it for India ? Hope Americans can see my posts too . My clients are mostly from there.,2023-12-26

5,Look at it almost daily,2023-11-29
1,Reddit is an awful place now that the API changes have been made...,2023-12-09
1,I wonder how many reddit users are aware their account is banned and has been for a long time. No one but them will ever see their posts.,2024-03-12
1,"It is absolutely up to the mederators, if the decide to ban or suspend you without providing a reason.",2023-11-14
1,"Ads look like actual post. Reddit intentionally allows this so you will fall for this. All that being said the biggest frustration is seeing a post for literally days come into your feed. You start off thinking its a repost multiple times in different subreddits, day after day, but nope. Its the same post but now its 5 days old amd still popping up. Wasnt interesting 5 days ago and its not interesting now. Bring back 3rd party apps",2024-02-10
1,"Not saving login status, having to manually login every time the app launches.",2024-01-11
5,I love it,2024-01-20
1,"We can't delete things in our own inboxes, we can't save post drafts, nor can we delete replies, which forces me to have to block people in order to no longer see their reply. I have to use np.reddit just to turn off replies on posts/comments. We can't use the Fancy Editor or save drafts on the app. I set Comments to be listed from Newest to Oldest, the app keeps resetting them to ""Best"" first. Explain why we need this app.",2024-02-06
5,Great connector,2023-11-20
5,love it mayne!,2023-11-08
3,"As much as I have enjoyed reddit, they have broken the mute function for users. No where could I find out how to report the issue. So now I get constantly bombarded with posts from the same communities I have already muted. And ro make things worse, when I mute some topic, subject or type of post, I am then bombarded with similar posts with the message that I have shown interest in that subject. The only interest I had shown was that I did not want to see that type of post.",2024-03-22
3,So I'm not going to completely complain like the rest of them are but I do want to complain that sometimes when I'm reading a particularly long post and I scroll down I can't scroll back up to click on the username or whatever so that's a problem for me at least. #voice to text,2023-11-19

4,"Playing. Starfield, love this app for suggestions.",2023-12-02
1,"Absolutely terrible. Horrible UI, horrible UX. Worse than the 3rd party apps in every way.",2023-11-08
1,"Horribly formatted. Repost bots plague Reddit, and nothing is done about it. Video scrolling copies TikTok's format. The owner of Reddit's a creep, as he defended a ""jailbait"" subreddit saying its deletion would violate freedom of speech. When subreddits were participating in a ""blackout"" to protest against upcoming changes, Admin threatened to/did replace the moderators of participating subreddits if for continuing. Also, they erased my previous review of the app and left only the stars.",2024-03-06
1,"What on earth did Spez do to the app?! I briefly redownloaded it because you cannot make posts on the mobile browser version, and oh my God, it's horrible now! It's laggy, glitchy, basically unusable.",2024-02-22

1,"If someone sends you a reddit link and you click it, it will open in a browser instead of in the app. When you do, it'll ask if you want to open in the app. If you say yes, it will take you to Google Play store instead of opening the link.

5,Best way to meet some interesting people,2024-02-24
1,Adds are indistinguishable from content. Content is consistently astroturfed. Admins are anonymous and not beholden to any rules and frequently break their own rules and promises. The GUI is wirse than apps created by fans in an afternoon 5 years ago and somehow getting worse. They should improve their service instead of appealing perfectly reasonable reviews on the playstore. In short: actual garbage,2023-11-12

5,I like the Reddit app. I can manage the notifications for my needs and writing posts is very easy,2024-03-21
2,"The app will no longer hide communities in notifications. I now am constantly spammed on my phone by notifications of posts from communities I've viewed once, and the Hide Community button does nothing over literally thousands of spammy notifications. Turning community notifications off in the app means it also turns off notifications from the communities I use frequently. Please fix this nonsense, it's ruining my Reddit app experience.",2023-12-16

1,So bad,2023-12-05
1,This one is simply inferior to the other 3rd party app I use for reddit. And it's pretty evident by seeing the review rating on here being 3.5 as of this writing while the other app that has had to shut down that I've used for years was at a 4.9. update: the rating is now at a 3 and it shows that it belongs lower as I have had worse experiences with this app then rif before your apk nonsense. Won't load videos right after coming back to app because they work worse than YouTube shorts.,2023-11-30
4,A collection of the diseased imaginings of humanity. Can be quite amusing at times. It's the literary equivalent of farting in an elevator and running away.,2023-10-29

1,Bigoted App Terrorist supporter.,2024-01-04
1,"One of the worst app development team ever, pushing random, useless updates every week or so, each progressively makes it less stable and worthless! Latest updates make long images not displayed on feed ! This is the most inapt, ignorant testing I have seen ! Do they even have a quality assurance?

5,"Reddit is a go-to resource for me professionally (IT), especially in discussing vendors critically outside of their own forums, and for my interests/hobbies personally.

5,Nice,2023-12-24
1,"I was forced to use this ""fantastic"" app from July of last year, and there haven't been many improvements since then. The only good things I would say this app has over the third party app I used, is that posts on the home section from subs I follow are more relevant. However, there are many cons with this app. There is barely any customisation like changing fonts, or individual sizes for text (Title, body and comments.) The video player is awful, and the app constantly stutters when scrolling.",2024-03-07

1,Terrrible UX,2023-11-01
1,Curently the app is slow af. I have to send links to posts to instantly see posts because reddit loads the posts I press for a long time. Reddit better fixes the issue because it is only for phones. PCs have no issues with entering posts.,2023-11-16

1,"Constant ads, laggy scrolling, terrible layout that doesn't show if you've seen a post already, not worth using reddit anymore. Gave it a week, still too many ads, worthless ""suggestioned"" posts, hope the api change was worth ruining the site. ""you will no longer see posts from r/whatever"" then keep popping up. Still constant ads, still spamming with pop-ups to enable notifications. I keep running speed tests to see if the internet is the problem. Update 11/23 still garbage",2023-11-23

1,"No sorting filters for home feed since they removed it. I have a feed of posts from communities I'm subscribed to, and I can no longer sort it.

5,"More groups and subgroups and topics than just a few years ago. There is a strict enforcement of rules.

2,I got it so the website would stop interrupting me to whine about how I should use the app. It works well for stopping all the sniveling and crying the website does when you're not using the app. Not as good as the website though.,2023-12-05

1,"The app is not smooth at all and you can only send 3 pms to different people in a 24hr period or you can buy more pms. The issue is that there are tons of bogus accts so 3 new pms a day is nothing. You can no longer send gifs in chats or videos either. The mods are absolutely zionists, I made a factual comment with no anger or threats and i got banned permanently yet there are thousands of pedophiles openly selling CP.

It just keeps randomly scrolling back to the top after you've been browsing for 5 minutes or 2 hours(!)..... the button layout is horrible as well. Who puts the Home button in the lower left corner instead of the middle? That makes it really easy to hit it if you're scrolling with your left hand. Ugh.,2023-12-04

Ads are irrelevant, indistinguishable from actual content and they are everywhere. The video player cropps off every video by default (unless you click on it), and gets hidden when you want to comment on a video.",2024-01-02

1,"Uninstalled and deleted my account after over 10 years of membership. Reddit used to be a place where everyday people shared opinions, humor, informative walkthroughs, etc. Since elimination of the third party apps on 7/1/23, this corporatized marketplace force feeds you subreddits and ads you have no interest in, even when you actively try to curate your interests and ""mute"" or ""hide"" communities. So sad to have to walk away, but this isn't the Reddit we grew up with. Cheers.",2024-01-03

1,No real people. Only bots. Whoever buys this company needs to sue for getting a platform that has no real users. Edit: I didn't even realize I have actually completely stopped using reddit because of the lack of non partisanship on the home page. Why do you guys find it better to isolate certain groups of people to different platforms other than your own? Election interference should also be investigated by congress. There's is clear censorship and control of speech on the platform,2024-01-23

1,Honestly ever since the third party api changes being forced to use this app it's not worth reddit anymore. The app is buggy. They keep making changes that are against what users actively want. And it runs worse than any other third party app for Reddit. RIDICULOUSLY DISAPPOINTED.,2023-11-18

1,"The browser version says I need the app to look at anything Reddit deems sensitive, from random news articles to anime(which can make sense). So I tell it to launch the app and it boots me to r/all and doesn't launch the app. I then log into the browser and it logs me back out to tell me to use the app. Rinse and repeat. The rare times it does launch it just goes to my home page instead of the page I was trying to get to. If you're going to force me to use the app at least make the app work.",2023-12-27

2,"Garbage and nobody cares. Filled with specific, irritating features that they know nobody wants, but it allows them to shove another morsel of a stupid commercial down your throat. At the same volume as the last video you actually wanted to watch. Why does a video restart when I view the comments? Who thought that's what anyone wanted? Did anyone do any thinking or is that an unrealistic expectation? Not enough characters to continue. Garbage. Makes sense why they banned the other apps",2023-12-19

Features either flat out don't work or are just completely missing, posting anything is a complete nightmare, often says ""unable to post"" when posting, most the time that is the case and whatever you're trying to post doesn't post OR you keep hitting post and it will give you the error message but in reality you've posted it 13 times now.

2,"Accessing Reddit through a browser may be better at this point. Tapping something hides a comment, which is a great way to lose your place, while tap and hold brings up a set of share options that covers the majority of the screen. Currently the worst offender in Android is that audio starts playing for posts or videos that are not even on screen. Be ready for a bevy of random voices and sounds while scrolling, some of which seem to continue even after switching apps.",2024-02-12
1,"The UX is just the worse. Like what's the deal with the popups (save post, comment, download etc) that last for eternity and keeps you from using the app ? TikTok works because it removes pain points but Reddit keep adding pain points.

I think that this can easily be accomplished by using standard Android API. This makes Reddit unusable on my phone, since when I use the web version, I'm promoted and forced to use the app, and in it, I can't follow any links.",2023-11-08

1,1) Bring back up down scroll to go to next and previous post. the new right to left scrolling sucks.

1,Before the API changes content felt more 'alive' and 'mature'. Nowadays it kind of feels 'artificial' and 'colorless'. Kind of depressing. I have no idea why it's like that but it seriously isn't fun anymore. It feels like that previous automation done by bots relying on the API had a better filter in order to give me more catered content. Nowadays it just feels a little dry which in my opinion is a horrendous feeling. I feel like reverting API changes could fix this.,2023-11-08

5,"The app is a cesspool. I got permanently banned simply for having a different opinion. The mods and admin of reddit are some of the most toxic people you will ever have the displeasure of running into. Have I different opinion than someone. 500 down votes.

If you don't follow the hive mind of leftists, Republicans, and liberals on the app you WILL be harassed and on top of that the moderation is terrible.

5,Great place for advice,2023-12-03
2,Not a fan of being forced to use an app when there's a perfectly good website available. It's arbitrary which threads you can't view on Web and have to switch to an app because you're accessing it from a phone.

Every post has the first comment blocked by an ad and the post must be reloaded to view. When there is a series of pictures, if you try to swipe past the last entry it just goes to some random post. There's a pernicious Christian propaganda ad that was blocked but is now ubiquitous across the app and they have disallowed the ability to block or report it. Trash app.",2024-03-19
2,"I'll give credit where it's due, you are getting a bit better. Glad there's a notification category for messages alone. However one thing that can make this better if of the Classic Look option can be applied to my front page instead of a specific subreddit. That is what helps makes this look different. I've noticed that this, Instagram, X, and even Nextdoor all look the same in dark mode. Becomes hard to tell the difference.",2023-12-03
1,"This ""app"" is so bad that Reddit started charging for the API so people won't use other apps. Some of the worst things with the app: 1. Videos buffer endlessly 2.

1,I downloaded this app a few days ago for the first time since Reddit got rid of third party apps. I thought maybe it's not as bad as people say. Boy is this unusable. The UI is so unpleasant that I found myself avoiding the app entirely. Reddit has gone from my favorite place on the Internet to one I rarely come to now since I'm mostly a mobile user.

1,"At the time of writing, I've experienced multiple atrocious attempts of Reddit trying to fix problems that don't even exist. Along with a terrible video player, they add useless design overhauls that just inconvenience everyone. I'd like to say that before reddit was decent, but with lack of communication with the community, we get things like this. In my opinion you are better off using the website. If you're like me and liked old app versions of reddit there are various ways to access them.",2024-03-15

1,"I would give Reddit 0 Stars if I could. It's a garbage app where sissies gather to give each other support on their delusional opinions. I used to think honest discussions were had there. Nope,I was wrong. It's a site where you either agree or get banned. They can't take criticism. The moment you post a disagreement,they ban you. If you post a truth (like the sky is blue,on most days) they all Down vote your comment. Reddit is a stupid app where all the sissies gather. Avoid this app",2023-11-18

It's a major step back in functionality and it's extremely annoying. You can't quote, copy and paste easily, or add links easily. Since reddit made the choice to force everyone to use this app the site quality has declined severely.

3,It works but the fact you can't open any links in a real browser and in an app is ridiculous (why do I have to watch YouTube ads when I have a premium account?). Android should make it a rule that's it's forbidden to restrict content to an internal browser and not let have the option to use the one we want. It might actually break privacy laws such as GDPR since there is no control on the internal one.,2024-02-10

2,"It's decent enough but the really annoying part about it is that it is really difficult to share direct links that you find on Reddit, the reason being is because they want you to share the Reddit post rather than what the post is linking to, so the link is kept inside their internal browser with no way to allow you to open it in your own browser. Becomes super annoying when you can't open YouTube links in the YouTube app and instead have to watch it through their internal browser instead",2023-10-28

2,"While it technically works, it's never as good as the long gone free 3rd party reddit experiences. It's also buggy and not well optimized. Be careful if you look at a post in a community you're not interested in - you may be stuck with notifications to that subreddit going forward, even if you indicate you're not interested from within the app. If you're on a folding phone, you're not going to have a great time since neither view is optimized and the app remembers each screen separately.",2024-01-29

1,"Constant logouts, sometimes in the span of 10 minutes. It's the only app that isn't smooth on my S23 Ultra. The UI/UX is also godawful, with the swiping between threads thing repeatedly interfering with Android's back gestures and comments being hidden on tap because I want to prevent my screen from going to sleep. Having to go back completly to open the sidebar is also stupid. Actually I should give it 5 stars because the app is so bad that I genuinly waste less time on Reddit as a consequence.",2024-03-02

I can't figure out how to view a custom feed after making it, there's no way to automatically filter out posts based on flair or based on keywords in the title, and the experience with the video player has only gotten worse over time.

It's so bad now you will just see the same 10-20 posts over and over and over, most of it bots. Now, they've changed it where you no longer scroll, you swipe between posts(super buggy and annoying.)

4,"What's annoying about reddit is when you switch to another app for a while (Firefox to read or youtube) and get back to reddit you lose where you are at (subreddit or exact place on the list due to scrolling down) and reddit set you on the top and try to load the new subreddit list, like you just open the reddit app. SOOOO ENOYING.

Gets worse every update...not even joking....",2023-12-16
1,"The recent update made many features worse and introduced new bugs. The app will randomly refresh, sending me back to the top of the post. Only one or two parent comments will load at a time. Images load much more slowly or not at all.",2024-03-22

Well I don't hang around a place that wants to permanently suspended or ban me I really never posted very much on your app. So I can assume you didn't like what I had to say especially since I found that atheists in that haystack portrait thing.

1,This app does not work,2023-12-11
1,Poor UI filled with poorly identified ads that try to disguise themselves as legitimate posts in order to trick you into clicking them. The latest update now causes the app to crash whenever I try to post a comment. Unacceptable performance considering how Reddit went out of its way to shut down third party apps.,2023-12-05
1,SUCKS!!!,2023-12-21
1,"Do not use this app if your looking for a place that's free speech. The sad Reddit mods will look for any reason to take your post down and ban you, even when you're acting within rules , for instance I posted an Xbox club to the Xbox sub Reddit and got banned by a trigger happy mod with no reasoning or understanding skills, most sub Reddits are like this. Don't waste your time. One thing you can't even copy and paste on this app. Yours sincerely and never again u/Positive-Nose-4619",2024-03-13
2,They sacrificed usability for ads. App is currently buggy and can't display complete comments but sure can serve up ads. They spiked all the other third party apps and alas this is the only option for most.,2024-03-18
5,Gotta love Reddit!,2023-12-10
1,"I deleted my account, and uninstalled this app. Post's here can not be taken seriously or considered legitimate posts by actual people. Posts on this sight are too silly and seem to be ""fishing"" for reactions to non-realisitic posts.",2024-02-26

I also submitted an appeal they said I had finally get banned. I read their privacy and policy's, I see that even all my account before I follow their guideline, So I don't know the reason. Maybe their platform is one of the best online forum in world, I think that is why they are doing these.",2024-02-12
1,"The amount of ads is unreal and terribly intrusive. It's clear that the app was not made with users in mind, but rather as a clunky and money grabbing serving platter for ads. I'd like to personally take this time to congratulate reddit on successfully removing any other options from its user base in the name of the almighty dollar.

1,Bug in latest patch prevents me from viewing my profile or my subbed subreddits. They never load and the app is unusable. I tried contacting support and received nothing.,2024-02-12
1,One of the worst optimized apps I have ever used. Random freezing and not loading or slow loading is just one of many issues. The new policy reddit uses forces you to use the reddit app or pay for another app. Seems they intentionally made the app work badly so you would pay them for working features on their platform.,2024-01-06

If I can help just one person? It's meaningful to me. I find help, too. I'm not bombarded. It's 2023. I'm still using Reddit and enjoy it immensely. It has been especially helpful through the years of isolation the world has experienced and illnesses / being stuck in the house. Great way to explore the world!",2024-03-08

1,"Buggy, laggy, constantly logged out. Bring back third party apps. Those devs actually cared about fostering an online community, not just slowly choking it to death in order to extract profits. When you took out RedditIsFun, I went from a 10 year daily user to an occasional user, and I suspect there are many like me.",2023-12-12
1,One of the worse reddit apps I've used. It's as if it was designed to make navigation and visiting subreddits more challenging just so they can show you more adds and sponsored posts.,2023-11-30

1,"I downloaded this app just for resetting my password, AND IT STILL SAYS ERROR",2023-12-11
2,"December 23 update I've deleted the app for almost a year now installed it again. The app looks much better, however now there are ads much more frequently than before. The app is better, more stable but Reddit became greedy and the communities itself look to be non functioning (a huge sub with almost 1m ppl has no mods for example, so cyber bullying is there). So I raise the rank to 2 star for stability fixes, however it's became the most toxic place online so beware.",2023-12-15

1,Too many outages and glitches for something that has been around this long.,2024-02-08
1,Glitchy as often when commenting or looking at posts it switches to a post I was looking at an hour ago. Also the algorithm means I never get to see the diverse range of subreddits I'm subbed to and only shows me the ones that I have to read and thus spend a long time on. It means that my whole reddit is one subreddit and very boring. Additionally it just stops scrolling in comments view after a while even though the content is present and loaded when in the home view,2023-11-07
5,Very handy,2023-12-13

1,"The official Reddit app has never been remotely good which is why third party apps were so popular but instead of fix their app, Reddit killed third party. Forced to use the official app now, it was ok but recently it has become atrociously bad with most media content simply loading. The mobile website is even worse. Reddit's desperate attempt to IPO is resulting in shittier quality that will eventually see the website become irrelevant. Slow clap reddit.",2024-02-27

1,Highly moderated by unreasonable woke mods who don't tolerate even polite discussion. Just a sounding chamber for woke garbage.,2024-03-30

Not mine!) after every restart of the app or account swap. Never had this problem until this version, and am sick of dealing with it. Why even have settings if they're ignored and overwritten without user consent?",2024-03-02
2,"This app is definitely a mixed bag. There are some serious technical issues that can make using the app downright frustrating. For example, the upvoting system seems to be completely broken.

It either swipes to popular, or partially swipes and doesn't complete The touch points are completely off. I touched in the upper left corner to close a comment and it liked the comment below (in the lower right corner) Sometimes it will randomly open a gif in a different comment when closing a comment.

It is so infuriating, videos never load, comment sections on posts won't load, functionality of looking at replies to a comment in thread is atrocious and you can get stuck in a thread with pressing back just closing the app. By far the worst app I have to use on a regular basis.

Used to have a great mobile app for reddit till it closes down, have tried using the mobile site for a while but it has an annoying bug right now where it returns to the top of the page every time you back out of the post, so I figured I'd try the official app again. Really terrible experience, will just deal with the very subpar webpage from mobile. The default layout is in your face and annoying compared to what I want",2024-02-07

4,Great,2024-02-22
1,"Every change Reddit makes to the app has made it worse. The app is designed around advertising and monetization instead of used experience. It's not even subtle. That's why the admin killed competing apps. They could give users a better experience, but prefer to allow bots to pump fake numbers to advertisers. Unfortunately if you want to Reddit this is it now, but I don't have to like it. Fix your app Reddit!",2023-11-14

5,Informative and a good source of videos you can't find on other sites,2023-11-01
1,Does a bad job of determining scroll directions. Will play audio of ads + previous posts even after you try to move on. Tons of ads disguised as posts. Shut down all the competitor apps b/c they were much better + didn't cram ads. Reddit continues to go downhill + this app is a great example.,2024-02-05

1,Honestly the app is a really poorly implemented ad cash grab by the product management team. Executive decisions have left once community focused initiatives empty and content is driven by engagement so the bot problem is rampant and the content is often recycled. You're better off not downloading the app and just staying online so you can maintain ad blockers; especially since they're basically committing fraud by forcing ads on users that are extremely against all forms of ads.,2023-12-06

1,"App just sucks. Mods got power hungry. Now you can just watch Reddit ban people for upsetting people that post quotes like ""kill then all"" or ""they should all die"". Funny because they removed the ability to pay unless it's a post that official reddit supports. Just join knowing the algo + reddit will push you for both controversy and things you like. Also, the phone app has been bad for 7 years. Instead of fixing it, Reddit removed competitors.",2023-12-01

Impossible to navigate, bloated with ads, zero transparency or privacy options, and the most user unfriendly interface I've ever seen in a mobile app. Tried to use this after they forced third party apps to shut down and the difference is infuriating.

To be honest, it's okay for me in this regard, however - I can't translate comments in app anymore and copy/paste mechanics breaks the flow really bad. It kills this app for me, unfortunately.

5,My only complaint is that I cannot copy and paste,2024-02-23
1,"Literally the worst way to view Reddit and only used because they actively sabotage other platforms. Even the mobile site is better even though it incessantly asks you to use the app instead. Random crashes, actually fewer sort features than mobile or desktop, obnoxious ads, no wonder they had to price out other apps to force users to try this absolute piece of garbage",2023-12-07

1,"Reddit has made it so its not possible to view NSFW posts on mobile browsers even though I have an account with a mature birthdate.

1,Community driven app with a CEO that cares nothing about the community. Forced to use this awful app lacking so many basic features. The layout for certain sections is awful with no option to change it. Every update seems to make this app worse. Ruined guestues. Stop messing things up. WORST APP DEVELOPERS EVER!!!!!!!!!,2024-03-24
1,"Awful app. Acutely felt as we had much much better options like Boost before Reddit killed them. This thing freezes, stutters, fails to load video in line sometimes. And it cannot handle links passed to it from a browser; just get a blank screen.",2024-01-24

4,Addictive. I like following communities where I learn stuff.,2024-03-10
1,"Ads that take up most of the screen being at the very top of the app as soon as you open it makes me want to use it way less. I'll probably move over to desktop with an adblock at this point.

2,"I stopped using Reddit when they killed all the good apps but an trying now that football is back and man is this thing underwhelming. Sync Pro was so much better. To be clear, the communities on Reddit are great and amazing, but this app is God awful.",2023-11-11
1,Very easy to use. I feel like I can express everything here. But the app is very problematic.,2024-03-01
1,"Wasn't bad at first until you disagree with those with certain agendas. Looking at mod profiles 90% of them are compromised with conflicts of interest Was too obvious as well, basically to push certain agendas and if you don't do it they will ban and perma ban you for threatening their bosses. I posted in particular on rebubble which got me many thumbs up for posting the truth but since the mods were in real estate industry they wanted things that would benefit them and shut down popular info",2023-12-21

1,"They force you to download the app. They deliberately make the website experience horrible on mobile. Constant pops up telling you to download the app, not letting you scroll through all the comments forcing you to login, and going back sometimes takes 10sec and or it just doesn't work so you end up backing out of your mobile browser so you end up losing your place.",2024-02-07
2,"New update is hell. Changed the UI and how it operates. Can't see text for individual photos in a post, just opens the comments if you try. Instead of not being able to swipe after you get to the last photo on a post it takes you to a random post. Changed how the videos are played from scrolling up and down to scrolling left and right, trying to scroll down opens comments. None of these very annoying features are optional.",2024-03-13
1,There is a ad every 3-6 posts. The only reason I even tried the app was because they intentionally made all third party apps not work and also made the web browser functionality terrible. Everything about navigation needs serious improvement but features are otherwise fine.,2024-01-27

3,I would give it 5 stars if they didn't promote echo chambers. Down voting a comment to where you can't see it makes ppl think that their opinion is the only one. No 2nd thought about it.,2024-01-12
1,"App stutters on Android when scrolling, audio plays even after leaving the content, ads are intrusive and extremely repetitive, and various other bugs and issues that seem to have only gotten worse over the years. If you're going to kick out 3rd party devs from making a better app, you've got to fix the native app first. This app needs a lot of work to be usable. Uninstalled.",2024-01-15

1,"reddit won't make a good mobile app and purposely prevents others from doing so. and now it only loads the top 1-2 comments so if you read comments regularly, you have to click to load comments over and over. feels like the IPO has just destroyed a good thing. incredibly dissappointing.

1,Impossible to reply to comments on my Samsung Galaxy S23. App will either go to home screen or crash entirely when hitting the reply button. I have no way to continue communicating with somebody I was helping with a pretty serious issue. Inconvenient to the point of being unacceptable. I've used this app for 10 years and it's never been so poorly managed. Shows how much they care about the user. Maybe time to change up your leadership?,2023-12-06

3,It's OK but the 3rd party apps were much more flexible.,2024-01-27
5,Interresting.,2024-01-23
1,The app doesn't feel very user-friendly and is extremely difficult to navigate. I never have any idea how to access the forums I am a part of and the notification system feels clunky and not useful. There is so much potential for an app like this if only it were easier for everyday women like me to use it successfully. I also wish it were easier to discover new forums,2024-03-10
2,"Decent app, has improved a lot. still some usability bugs. sometimes posts are covered by ads. sometimes replies are covered by ads. sometimes the ads crash the app. sometimes videos stop playing. sometimes images stop showing. force close and restart still works as a work around to some of these issues.",2024-03-13

1,"Reddit is a fantastic platform, but this app makes browsing a frustration due to bugs. The two most frustrating things for me are videos not playing after browsing for several minutes and having to restart the app to fix that. Restarting make me lose my place. Also leaving the app sometimes doesn't bring me back to where I left off. Edit: I i downloaded it again after several months. No improvement and un installing again.",2023-12-05
1,This most recent update is horrible. Cannot comment on anything without it crashing. It has been getting progressively worse,2023-12-06

1,"New update makes it very hard to use. The swipe for next post thing is very confusing and frustrating especially with multiphoto posts, have even have it swipe to next post instead of next image.

1,Bad - forces tablets to use portrait mode. This factor alone gets the app a 1 star review.,2023-12-28
5,"Good app, except they updated so that websites on phone that take you to a reddit page force you to use the app, which they used to not require. This is a shameless effort to get you to download the app. Update fixed so now is only optional. 5/5.",2023-12-13

I curated them, but they're shoved at the end of a list I presume Reddit wants to be lengthy - my subs? Awful. It's ugly and unintuitive. Finding my own posts is a journey thorough tabs. It will repeatedly lose contact with it's own website. When you scroll, it will jump you over to the popular tab. Poor effort. Shame.",2023-11-18

1,"While editing a post if I pull up my list of tabs on my phone, not even going to another app, just looking at the preview of what a different app was last showing, I lose my progress on my edit and have to go back to the post. This doesn't help when I'm looking at another tab to help with what I'm adding to my post. I have to type up what I want to say in notepad and copy and paste it onto Reddit. I shouldn't have to do all this and didn't use to have to. Stop changing things with updates!!!",2024-03-25

5,Cool,2023-12-12
1,"Every new update breaks something else. First, shortly before they got rid of awards, my ""next comment thread"" button stopped working properly. I now have to scroll partway down the thread and then hit it in order to go to the next one. Next, images and videos straight up wouldn't load unless I went into the post manually to see it (this has since been very recently fixed). Now, it takes way longer to load anything. The 3D icon looks dumb. And commenting crashes the app. Good job, Reddit.",2023-12-05

3,New here,2024-01-10
5,Great!,2023-11-30
1,I used to use a third party app and after the api changes I was forced to use this. The front page sort is an AI fueled dumpsterfire that keeps showing the same subreddits. Instead of giving you the option to sort by hot like the website they removed the hot/best sorting option on purpose in favour their black box dopamine generator. After giving this a chance for a couple of months I'm back to using the website on my phone.,2023-12-13
1,"The options and comment section doesn't load half the time. I've got 5G internet, so it's not my connection that's the problem. it's also becomes slow at random times",2024-01-24

1,When are going to bring back the option to change the text size? Recently the text size in in the app has gone too small and it's really difficult to read.

5,Has a little bit for everyone,2024-01-13
1,"The stock reddit app was never good, but this most recent update made it even worse. I can't even use the app without it crashing every couple of minutes.

5,Reddit has so much to explore it can be a bit addicting,2023-11-09
1,"It's honestly incredible how terrible this app is at performing basic functions. You kill your mobile site, it forces me to open in-app. App comes up... Post never opens, just the reddit logo forever. Do you guys have developers? Or is this like a student project for the CEO's kid? What are you guys doing?",2023-12-29
2,Not functioning properly since the last update. Same comments showing multiple times. Can't load all the comments or see full posts. Voting isn't working. App is a disaster.,2024-03-15
1,This app has become the most annoying app ever. None of the messages or post open properly in the app and everytime I open a reddit link in any browser it forces me to view that in app. Either make a efficient app and transparent online portal or shut down your company.,2024-01-13
5,The world famous acujack used world wide in peep shows. It was automated back in the 80s. A true automatic wack off machine. I believe they used step motors a nd gear box?

1,Was never as good as 3rd party apps but now those are gone and the official app has gotten worse. Between all the ads and irrelevant suggested posts cluttering up the feed it's barely even usable.,2024-02-21
1,Tyranny admins push an absolutely ridiculous forum where only the approved opinion is allowed. It was a good site before Ellen pow and ghislane maxwell became admins and power mods.,2023-11-30
1,This app is broken. The threads glitch and jump all around while you're scrolling. Try to up vote something and it collapses and you can't find it again. Horrible experience.,2024-03-17
2,The way they went about 3rd party disappoints me and makes me dislike this application even more. Overall It's not a good app. It's slow and not user friendly.

1,"The only reason I use this app is because reddit killed third party apps. Apps that were 10x better than this excuse for a functioning piece of software. Forget functioning video, forget the thread staying where to left it. If you like seeing the same posts over and over again or like scrolling to find where you were, or an advert every minute then be my guest. The app sucks.

Speaking of deleting, I couldn't even remove or delete the notifications. The only way to ""remove"" it is to turn off which I rather not. Overall, this is a very unsatisfying app to use.

There is currently no way to prevent this, and Admins have admitted this is intended behavior. I've been using Android since 2009, and this is the only app I've ever come across that does this.

For example, the thing you say is not illegal, it's not violent, it is not threatening, it is not provoking anyone to be aggressive, it's just your own opinion that people far left don't agree with. In other words, they don't want you to even tell them why you are against a specific leftist agenda. They will ban you from that group and remove your post.",2024-03-22

In terms of the ability to generate a sub it can be bulky and a bit confusing and somewhat destructive in places. But I'm still learning this process ask me again in several months.

3,UPDATE (11 DEC 2023): I notice there is a Reddit status website where you can check whether the app/web is down or operational. I checked it today because I noticed that Reddit (both app and website) are currently down and was happy to see that the status site was actually accurate and showed that there is an issue. It got me thinking that there should be a Reddit status app. An app you can download where you can check Reddit's status and see what issues it's having. Just a thought though üôÇ,2023-12-11

1,"This app ruins the homepage experience with content ads and recommendations for subreddits you aren't subscribed to.

Spoiler, bold, italics, links, super script etc etc. These were present in basically every 3d party app. How is it you don't have it in yours? For the love of God. Add text sizing options.

1,"Every update makes it less and less functional, unless it's shoving an advertisement in your face. Features don't work even after selecting them several times, it constantly recommends subreddits even after explicitly saying ""not to see"" anymore, and it is overrun with bots and spam content in order to, you guessed it, shove more ads in your face. Don't use this app! It is repellent, greedy, and lost any soul it may have once to please shareholders. RIP reddit is fun",2024-03-02

1,"When minimizing comments, it now just snaps closed, no longer a fluid motion. I didn't do anything, is it automatically like this now?? Also, new ui for opening/closing posts is very clunky. To click on an image (in card mode) and have it open the post to I must click the image again for it to full screen. Not to mention the very weird minimization at the top of the post title and image/video where the video will be so small I can't tell what's happening yet it will still play w/ audio/visual.üëé",2024-03-29

The app stutters and loads images slowly. Also the author's name is not visible unless I open the post. There is no return to top button in the feed. Can't collapse a comment from a deleted user.

1,It really is sad that we are stuck with this dumpster fire of an app. Truly horrible in every sense. Constant changes that nobody asks for. The newest thing?

Manually going into app settings and deleting the app data is necessary after a few months to keep the app running at its normal slow speed.

3,"I would like to thank Reddit for making the app usable for moderators. Now I can spend a day or two moderating my sub without the need to login from my PC.

1,This app red flags almost every comment I make or whatever they call it I made like five comments and they hit every one of them because I have opinions. Then when someone ask a question on there it's like well they want to answer. I don't understand how to answer a question without having an opinion doesn't make sense. So the apps pretty much just a bunch of extremely woke hyper progressive lightweight fascists but it's all ran by bots so you can't have your own opinion Don't even try it.,2023-12-09

5,"Reddit, divided into various communities (subs), makes it easy to reach others with similar interests. You can look for tips or offer advice on almost anything. It is probably the closest thing to social media anyone should ever get. Yes, you will see terrible people here just like the rest of the Internet, but since each community moderates its own content, the worst people tend to get pushed out (as it should be). Browse Reddit and learn something that interests you.",2023-12-13

1,"There are sooooo many bugs that it's insane. The worst one for me is if i scroll left on a picture, there is a 50 50 chance of changing tabs, not the picture. Also, if you are messaging someone, all you get is the first notification message. If they message again, you won't know unless you check. I really miss RIF. Edit.

1,Garbage format vs 3rd party apps and riddled with ads,2024-01-06
1,For years now the Android version of this app has had a bug where it defaults to the wrong refresh rate and causes the entire app to lag when scrolling. For years. They've also essentially shuttered 99% of third party apps to force you to use this one. Reddit is a terrible service made by incompetent people who dont use their own product. Stay far away from this app. At this rate this will never be fixed as it seems the reddit devs forgot how to code.,2024-01-21

This app has gone so far south since they announced they were going public it isn't even funny. My account is 13 years old and now it's gone. Mods banned people for using the word ""female"" in normal context and now I'm banned for calling them out even though reddit reporting claims the mods broke policy and action was taken against them.",2023-11-18

Full size images are cut off in the post so the only way to see an image is by tapping it to open in a new window. Awful optimization and lack of intuitive UI and the only good thing I can say about it from a user standpoint is the tapping to minimize comment chains. EDIT: Still the same issues.",2024-02-10

1,Unbelievably scummy practices trying to bully 3rd party apps who have been nothing but reasonable just to try and appeal to investors for the upcoming IPO... For shame. I've used reddit for 9 years never on this garbage app and I cannot believe I'm having to change this 5 star to a 1 YIKES Edit: came back to see if they made it at all on par with the things they took from us after 6 months... nope it's worse than it ever has been terrible app avoid,2024-02-15

1,"I kept seeing inappropriate ads for ED products (Hims, Blue Chew) and couldn't get rid of them after flagging it and even disabling NSFW content. I also saw ads for things that I switched off in my settings (mainly alcohol and sports betting). It seems to me that Reddit has stopped caring about the user experience (disabling mods, doubling down on ads and extremist content) and has started caring more about money and identity politics.

1,"Laggy and slow. The amount of times you will hit the back button, think it didn't process and hit it again, only for it to go back to a previous page several seconds later is absolutely annoying. Other Reddit apps felt snappy, but Reddit is forcing everyone to use their official app now, which I wouldn't mind... if it didn't suck and was actually responsive.

1,You constantly get banned because reddit mods have a bias. Subreddit mods act recklessly too. I barely even tell my opinion but just hinting a different opinion than any mod will get you permanently banned from a subreddit or a 7 day ban of reddit completely.

Prevents you from being able to take a screenshot or even select text on your own device.

1,Honestly there are so many small bugs it's hard to keep it to 500 characters but the biggest issue is that it won't let you swipe for the next story *consistently* and clearly the app developers do not care about bugs or user experience (the r/bug reddit wouldn't let me post in it to get the help I needed),2024-03-25

1,"When the reddit redesign came along the app was actually pretty nice and a good way to scroll through posts. The updates have been taking steps in the wrong direction though, instead of fixing the incredibly slow and studdery video player they just keep pushing UI changes nobody asked for.

Third party apps did this instantly. * Subs I muted appear again because ""I visited posts before"". Muting trumps that, just don't show it anymore. * Gallery previews use zoom to fill, should be zoom to _fit_. What good does half the picture do me in a preview??",2024-03-21

1,Adds will play and replay when you're not even looking at them as well as not stop playing until you restart the app. I can't fit all off the faults with this festering bloat app in this description anymore. Also reddit uses targeted info either gathered through the app or other sites through your mic and browsing data to show you subreddits and ads that it would never know about otherwise.

1,I tried my hand at Reddit to get genuine feedback about a technical issue I was having. I suppose after seeing the type of people who use this app (chronically online people who are mostly bullies that prob live in moms basement) it's for the best.

1,"If you are looking for ungodly amounts of censorship, download this app. The amount of censorship on the app is causing people to change political views and not in the way they want.

Better put on your boots and practice your goosesteps, cuz that's the culture these folks are emulating.

I used to use the website, but they constantly nag you to download the app. Every single page I go to, it has the prompt ""Do you want the best experience, use the app or continue to website"". Of course since they make it nearly impossible to use the website I download the app. Guess what it only works in portait mode.

1,It was real nice when Reddit allowed third party apps. Because third party apps worked and were tolerable browsing experiences. This is not. Ads are placed haphazardly. Trying to actually find what you want is difficult at best. And why am I getting notifications to view subs I'm not subscribed to? The whole point of setting up a reddit account was to unsubscribe from defaults.,2023-11-20

Bugs galore. The only app that causes my phone to burn my hand. Developers, something serious is clearly wrong. Unintuitive messy UI. Lacking some of the best features of third party apps, which the website had seemingly killed off to please their advertisers and shareholders",2024-02-29

Scrolling left/right to look at a picture will just shuffle you between the Home and popular page unless you click on post. Not user-friendly at all, I hate what they've done to Reddit.",2024-03-28

5,Good so far .,2023-11-15
4,"Generally, a very good experience, mostly a good community. The only frustrating part is when someone posts wrong, biased data with no sorce, and it gets upvoted because it was posted first, and below would be numerous factual data with reliable sources, but people are too lazy to go past one or two answers as the first answer got many upvotes. One of the way to deal with this would be to have something similar to community notes on X/Twitter, since then you wouldn't need to scroll down so much",2024-02-25

1,"Why does this app STILL LAG????? It's almost 2024, and this is the only mainstream social media app that has a HUGE SCROLL LAG.

2,Reddit is a good platform but the bugs really need to be fixed. My main complaint is that it takes FOREVER for Reddit to load up and open to my feed.

4,"Now that the official client is the primary means of reddit usage I find that being older, with the need for reading glasses in some cases, the comment font on the mobile client ts too small to easily read, even though the font size I've set in my android phone is a reasonable size for all other apps & browsers. Would love to see the option added to the client to change font size/scale for those of us with accessibility issues. 4 stars instead of 5 due to this current limitation.",2023-11-02

2,"This app is awful. It's clunky, full of ads, and generally a bad experience. It peeves me that the app asks me whether or not I am enjoying it and if I say yes it takes me here.

1,"Buggy, glitchy, unreliable, disappointed. Clicking a comment won't take you to it, random video sounds play, the UI is clunky and difficult to navigate. At first I gave my review 1 star because I was mad that Reddit was ending third party API support. But now that I've used the official Reddit app for several months, it truly deserves 1 star. It boggles my mind how simple yet amazing the Reddit is Fun app was (I imagine many others as well), and how terrible this official app is. Steer clear.",2024-01-14
