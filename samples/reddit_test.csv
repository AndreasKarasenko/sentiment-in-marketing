1,"Installing update, will see what happens. Rating will stay one star regardless due to your choice to fleece all the third party apps for committing the crime of designing a better app than you seem capable of.

1,The app is just bad. No landscape mode has finally made me pull the plug on this. I'm tired of this thing opening and turning my screen when I open a link to reddit. Shame they did away with Boost support. Reddit itself is still ok. I just won't be using the app anymore.,2024-02-03

5,awesome,2023-12-15
1,"I genuinely wonder if they made this app terrible on purpose. It's not even about the missing features from the 3rd party apps that were way better. It's the fact that this app can't seem to handle the website that it is designed for. It's clunky, glitchy, and pretty bare bones. Why does it decide to randomly scroll to the top when I am reading a post? Who decided to introduce the floating refresh button at random intervals? This app actually makes me use Reddit less.",2023-11-11

1,Just a terrible app in every way that is possible.,2024-02-21
1,It amazes me how consistently you can make an app worse with every update for such a long time. It's at the point where after the last update the app simply doesn't load for me anymore. I genuinely don't understand how such a well established platform can be managed so incredibly poorly.,2024-02-15

4,Great,2023-12-11
5,Sensational!,2024-01-15
1,Reddit is not a good app. Suspending use of open api for 3rd party apps makes it impossible to moderate small voluntarily run communities. While giving good platform for communities it withers them with bad policies.,2023-11-08
1,"It's just an awful app. It pushes ads, it's clunky, the UI is terrible, and there is a massive loss of functionality compared to all the other 3rd party apps out there. However, 3rd party apps are no longer supported, so this is it.",2023-11-08
1,"Horrible experience. Tried to send a private message to someone only to get ""Unknown Error"". Fine, whatever I'll go use the mobile website. Tapping on ""View Profile"" on the mobile website only opens the app. Great, thanks for that... Tap and holding it I finally can open the profile in a new tab on the mobile website. Now I'm greeted with no option to send a message to the user from the mobile website. Great job making your platform a headache to use.",2024-01-23

5,I really like this app,2023-12-15
4,"Video seems to be an important element of Reddit, so the uneven video playback issue continues to be annoying. There was a period where it was smooth, but it's back to starting and stopping, which ruins some videos where continuity is important.",2023-10-28
4,Very interesting with lot of good content which I can enjoy.,2024-02-10
1,"Sooo slooow. App just keeps getting worse. I select a post and it takes forever to load, but if the post has a picture and I tap that it loads immediately. Sometimes I can get around loading delay by tapping picture comments.",2024-02-17

4,Great place to find info,2024-02-18
1,"Man I left a while back due to that API thing. Tried to use the app again here in 2024 and it loaded slower then the PC version of the website on my phone. I use the 'PC' version to bypass the ""use the app"" popups.",2024-03-08

4,get word wearing sometimes when clicking in link to site. otherwise all good.,2024-03-18

3,Having issues with the app as of late. When i try and message someone in a private conversation the app crashes,2023-12-07
1,"Terrible UI compared to all the other options that they just killed off. Unoptimized, long load times, ads everywhere, and difficult to read. Your front page should be comprised of only subreddits you subscribe to, but it inserts random BS posts from stuff you aren't subbed to like ""since you looked at a Subaru subreddit once you're definitely going to want to see the Toyota Tundra subreddit!"" Don't tell me what you think I want to see. I know what I want to see. Trash app made by trash people.",2023-12-27

1,"Not only is the app itself bad, the moderation on Reddit itself is bad.",2023-10-31
2,"Atrocious experience half the time. I've got a powerful device and 1gb internet yet sometimes it's an act of congress to load a photo or video. Ads often play in the background of a post I'm trying to read and can't be muted, I can only back out of the post to stop it. Also why update the app where I can scroll up to go to the next post instead of sideways?? I'm trying to view mutliple pictures on a post not switch to a new post. The amount of recommended subs is SUFFOCATING. Be better reddit.",2024-01-26

3,I like the app but the only downgrade is the comment section in which can be quite confusing to follow up on each sub comments.,2023-11-12
1,Stop forcing people to use your stupid app. I only use this dumb website as an extension of my search engine. Stop trying to force traffic to your dying platform nobody cares but neckbeards. AND STOP EMAILING ME,2023-12-14

People will downvote you just for trying to help and no repercussions. Basically a big forum for people that enjoy being trolled and made fun of. Or fascist beta cucks.

1,"Reddit has killed all third party apps and is lacking all of the benefits of those apps and is making the official app more miserable to use, why can't I open links in external apps? why can't I chose the sort of my home page and am forced to sort by best? why can't I chose the parts of post and comments I want to copy but am forced to copy the whole post or comment? these are the musts of an app and Reddit didn't just not add them but removed them! this is ridiculous!",2024-01-18
1,Not loading at all saying can't find my username when I was just on here 5 minutes ago,2023-12-11
1,Many mods are under 18 and ban people who don't agree with them. Here's the workaround I've been doing it for years it works. Use your phone's data to talk and agree with the inbreds use another device like a laptop or old phone with your wifi. You can get banned and still use this trash app or use discord like everyone else,2024-01-07

1,Content censorship is real!!,2023-11-12
1,Seems like the app developers keep changing the way you swipe to get to the next video again and again. It was back to up/down swipe for a while (which I like) and now it's sideways again! It's a third time they do this. I hate it. What's going on??,2024-03-20
2,I like reddit. But I don't like the endless loading on the app. Also annoying af because I have to force open pages on Android if I want to use the sites at all currently. Feedback option just refers me back to.... Reddit which loads endlessly 🙄,2024-03-23

1,how can you remove access to other apps before yours even works decently? it's just ridiculous. I used to be on Reddit multiple times a day but now the experience on the app is so bad I use it less than ever before.,2024-03-06
1,The new Home tab sucks it used to show the popular posts on the subreddits im part of then now it just shows new posts from subreddits i have joined it sucks because new fresh posts arent what i need to see at my home tab screw you reddit,2024-02-07
1,Re-updating to 1 star. To think yall removed access to 3rd parties and yet this app keeps giving me errors.,2024-02-26
3,I do like the dark theme as well as the custom snoos that show up when I look at My Subreddits. It also has a lot of the functionality of other than reddit apps. Now onto the bad. I find that it's lacking some of the functionality of other Reddit apps. For example I can't edit comments directly from my comment history or go directly to that comment (or at least I haven't figured out how). Edited 1/26/17,2024-01-10

5,Do far so good,2023-11-04
1,This app sucks and alternatives are far better. However Reddit is now forcing 3rd party apps to shut down by way over charging them for API. This is a bad move and Reddit is a bad app. UPDATE: Still bad. The new update broke the button that sends you to the next set of comments. Absolute garbage.,2023-12-21

2,"Alright, let me just clarify some things firstly. I personally love reddit, with all the random videos and the genres or tags.. but after the sudden update or my re-installation, the app just suddenly does not work, like at all. It just keeps on loading and loading, and when I try to login or sign up, it says ""We're unable to authenticate you.""

2,"A very bad way to scroll through communities you have chosen to follow. Every 2nd/3rd post is a recommendation for another community or just an advert. Some will be borderline NSFW, so even if you focus the app on work-related communities you need to be careful using it for work. You won't see updates in small communities on your main feed. The search function is extremely poor (run your search through Google), and it is difficult to copy specific sections (use a web browser not the app).",2023-12-10

5,Great app,2023-11-05
1,Reddit is too sensitive. Sure the app is good go meet new people but there's better apps to do that like discord. The report feature often gets abused by people to ban others for things they didn't actually do from a subreddit and possibly your whole Reddit account. all of the UI changes the 1 start to 5 etar ratio and the controversy of them selling people's Private information to ai companies should be enough reason to not waste your time with this app there's better one's out there.,2024-03-05

I just haven't figured out how the whole thing works yet, though, which is why I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5. It's not being very user-friendly to me just yet.",2024-01-12
1,"It's serviceable for Reddit content, however the bugs on Android make it almost unusable. It reloads the feed any time you switch away from the app and when you change the default comment sort, it reverts back to ""Best"" every single time it reloads. Which is a lot.

4,From my POV reddit is a very helpful app you can use it to find guides or ask the community for answer's The reason that I give it 4 stars because it is sometimes hard to navigate around with all the ads around it is full of ads now. Recommend you all to install it.,2024-02-25

3,Ok app boi,2023-12-09
1,Garbage app. Bring back sync. Screw the corporate entity that robbed us enjoying what used to be a nicely cultivated community. What is the point of muting subreddits if I continue to see them? Why can't I speed or slow videos? Or zoom in? Almost all of the user interface is garbage which changes seemingly from post to post or subreddit to subreddit. Let us make it look how we want it to.,2024-03-12
5,Perfect way to surf quietly and get what you want,2024-01-20
1,UI sucks 1. I should be able to tap the whole entire screen to pause a video. 2. Volume button sucks. 3. When I refresh the page I have to scroll to the top or I'm missing content. 4. I can scroll to the next post and that's it. I can't continue scrolling to the post after that. Yes I'm on the classic reddit look. 5. A bunch of gifs with no sound.

4,"I've only been using it for a short time, but the app has been quick and easy to use. The organization of information is pretty good, though not ideal.

1,"Despite being a loyal Reddit app user, the persistent issue with images is disheartening. The inability to view images fully within the feed has been a longstanding frustration.

1,"I've been on Reddit for over a decade. It used to be a fun place, and great if you want to meet people with similar niche interests.

Stop shooting yourselves in the foot for God's sake.",2024-03-19

3,Have a weird product from a company that doesn't exist anymore? There's a group for that who will help you diagnose and fix it. I love weird products that didn't make it and have no technical skill but there's always someone who can help me make it work. :3,2024-03-12

4,Good,2023-11-29

5,Knowledge,2024-02-19
1,"Every update you make it worse. Somehow you need to swipe sideways for new content, instead of up. Videos stop playing or just break. Audio keeps playing in the background when you open another post. Viewing multiple pictures is a PITA, wanting to save them is even worse. Having to tape every time to save, to swipe and hopefully not swipe to the next post. Every basic function breaks, if you haven't deleted it already.",2023-11-06
2,Absolutely hate using this app. The only reason I have it is because the web experience is horrendous. But my life is better without using the app so I try to stay away from reddit.,2023-12-12

1,"I miss having a searchable menu of subscribed subreddits that meant I had to type like one or two letters to be able to find the subreddit I wanted to go to. Now I have to have to choose if it should go into my favorites list, but I don't want too many in there or it defeats the purpose. Now to go to a sub reddit I less often go to I have to scroll through so many that I hate using this app.",2024-03-09

1,Very stupid,2023-12-02
1,"Unacceptably garbage. Literally cannot fit all my issues in the character limit. Not being able to sort the home feed by anything other than hot despite hiw it use to be a feature, and the fact you can still witch feed types for subredeits and custom feeds is an irrationally stupid decision. Swiping left or right at any point can do any number of things depending on how the app is feeling, so have fun going over to popular 4 times instead of seeing the next image in the post you want to see.",2023-10-30
1,Now randomly freezes on a black screen when trying to open a post after scrolling down home page for a bit.,2023-10-30
1,"Filled with bugs and inconveniences. Mobile devices have the worst UI and many aspects and features of Reddit are not useable on mobile. I'm tired of putting up with these minor things while reddit continues to grow into a large and corrupt corporation. Don't even get me started on paid Internet points. Killing 3rd party apps will also make me leave Reddit because I need RES, as do many others. You can't even search your saved posts.",2023-12-31
1,"Am forced to use this terrible app due to content being blocked on the mobile site, which is way more useable and convenient for me to use. Don't understand why I need a separate app for this.",2024-01-07
1,"Just objectively worse than 3rd party apps. Will glitch and tell you to log in to comment, even if you're already logged in. Edit: app updated, trying to comment now crashes. Another criticism, the app will randomly scroll ALL the way back to the top of your feed. It's crazy how there were so many shining examples of how to make a reddit app, and they push this garbage app.",2023-12-05

Twitch thanks again.,2024-02-21
5,Enjoyable,2024-03-27
1,"Started as a 5-star, now reduced to 1-star due to Reddit's unresponsiveness. No issues giving Karma, yet the inability to receive makes the experience incomplete & 1-sided, reminiscent of Facebook's freedom of speech restrictions. Messages to me are allowed, but replies back are impossible. No alerts about a suspension or reason for one, and Reddit support remains silent. Deleting Facebook was a very positive change in my life; Reddit needs improvement for sure!",2024-01-20

1,"I have premium and still struggle viewing posts. After swiping through maybe up to 5 posts, the app refuses to let me view anymore so I have to press back and scroll to where I was so I can view more posts.

I've been using Reddit for at least 15 years & everyone has been helpful, honest/truthful & kind! It's fun or serious & informational. If you ask someone something & they don't know, they'll tell you who to ask or where to research it.

The UI is not easy on the eyes. It's awful that Reddit decided to force 3rd party apps to shut down and cant provide a decent app itself. I guess you shut down 3rd party apps because you couldn't bother competing with them fairly.",2024-03-04
4,"A LOT of dumb things about Reddit. They clearly do not care that much about users engaging with each other.

1,"As an update, I am still really hating this app compared to the 3rd party option I used before (redditisfun). The official app is designed to monopolise your attention and keep you scrolling, no pagination to trigger a pause. The suggested posts are the bane of my life. The algorithm suggests the most emotionally effective content so I get posts from drama subs all the time, never like fun facts or discoveries. I get that they want to drive up engagement, but it's a sorry downgrade.",2023-11-22

Stacks pages you open from other apps (chrome links for example) so you have to press back a thousand times to return to your previous app. There were many apps that did what this app is trying to do. But they weren't trying to squeeze their users for money. Honestly, any company that treats their users like adversaries meant to be 'defeated' in some way, needs to be burned to the ground. Highly recommend Lemmy on an app like Jerboa.#Leavereddit",2024-03-07
1,"Terrible. Not only is it slow, you have to keep rejigging your feed to stifle the algorhythm that will show the same 3-5 subs in order to get any variety from your actual subscriptions.

1,Sort by Best doesn't exist anymore. The unofficial apps were better. The new ui is also terrible and worse to use than old one. The new algorithm only shows low effort trash posts. I no longer feel like using reddit. Awful API changes to kill off 3rd party apps is also unacceptable. By removing options in the settings to make your app 'simpler' to use you've actively made it worse in every possible way. What a trash app.,2024-01-04

1,"Actual garbage. I go to reddit for curated content from communities I choose, not random bs from communities I've visited on accident or communities like the ones I subscribe to. $7/mo to get rid of ads is too much. Finding subreddit sidebars/rules shouldn't be so hard, it once took me 30 minutes just to figure out what the subreddit I was in was for. Why are you making a forum site into social media, it's not for that. It's like ground beef partially cooked with half a raw onion shoved in.",2023-12-15

2,Keeps crashing on long threads,2024-02-20
1,"I am writing this review because of the reddit API blocking that has come up in recent events, but it is 100% honest. I have been using this for a year. The app is full of ads, full of bugs, slow, and clunky navigation. Despite this, I have been using this app for a year or more. This app has improved since it was first introduced, but still pretty awful. Some of the third party apps were fast, a breeze to operate and discover new sub reddits. It's a shame Reddit put an end to them.",2024-03-04
1,"If you want to have ads shoved in your face this app is for you. Wanted to post an update to this review, nothing has changed for the positive.

1,"It's great if you just need an echo chamber for personal insecurities. Also pretty much filled with hate speech and racism despite whatever policies and monitoring reddit puts in place.

1,"It's crazy that the user experience gets worse every update and they literally just had to copy the handfuls of 3rd party apps that did every single thing better than the official one. Instead they forced everyone onto this garbage. Algorithm sucks, touch controls in the ui are garbage and poorly implemented, constant ads that masquerade as posts and did I mention how bad the ui is? Seriously you scroll albums by swiping but that also takes you to different pages. What genius thought of that one",2024-03-12

1,"This update is hot garbage, the new gestures are very annoying. Swipping left is the same way to get to the next post as to view the next image thats in a post with multiple images making you just not realize you went to a different post. Swipping up causes you to view comments which makes you have to swipe down to be able to exit any media post but I have to drag my thumb so far to exit it that it becomes uncomfortable.

5,VARIETY. ENTERTAINMENT FOR HOURS. UNLIMITED INSPIRATION,2024-02-24
1,"Massive lag when opening a post, it's generally very laggy, settings keep resetting when closing the app so first thing when opening it is changing my settigs again (noticed it with the setting to show thumbnails, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were other settings too). There's a reason why rif and other apps were so popular, they were stable and did what they were supposed to do. This critique goes to the higher ups of reddit, not the DEVs.

The app can't tell a vertical swipe from a horizontal one, and there is no inertia to the comments section divider, meaning you have to drag it all the way, 3""-4"", down to the bottom of the screen, instead of grabbing it and flicking it down with a gesture, like it used to be.

1,UI is terrible. Haven't been on Reddit much since rif went away.,2023-11-11
5,safe,2024-03-13
5,So much in one place - especially the jokes! Lol!,2023-10-30
5,Great for cursed images,2024-03-20

5,You can find a anything on reddit,2024-02-07
5,Sociable!,2023-11-03
2,Addictive in a bad way but fun. It also has audio issues. Playing the sound on video without muting it before continuing to school makes all following video play sound rather than stay silent. Even silencing those subsequent video doesnt prevent further videos from playing sound automatically. The only solution I've found has been scrolling to the original video where I enabled sound and muting it. Even muting the same video when it comes up as a repost doesn't solve the problem.

4,Good,2024-03-06
5,"Interesting, funny, informative and useful",2024-02-02

5,Reddit in all it'd awesome and cursed glory. Pretty much everything you get from the site itself right in the palm of your hand! No wonder they keep shoving us towards the app instead of letting us browse it in peace on our browsers 💙,2023-11-30

4,Not exactly in alignment with Reddit culture but the app itself operates well.,2023-12-11
2,I usually enjoy this app. But haven't been able to post in 3 days.,2023-12-22
5,Reddit is good for connecting with people who are genuine in this increasingly hate fueled Internet world of trollic commentary. And Reddit reminds everyone about being civil in a way that is effective instead of preachy.,2023-11-30
5,It is really good no I am not a robot,2024-01-27

1,So full of bugs that haven't been fixed in years.,2024-02-10
1,"This app is great for browsing thousands of communities but it eats a ton of ram, and I'm constantly clearing cache. I'm unable to load more than one photo at a time if at all. I get a ""unable to load photo"" prompt if I'm posting multiple photos. No notifications or suggestions as to which photo or why? I've cropped the photos but nothing works. This app has gone downhill. It's ridiculous and frustrating not to mention sloooow. Did I mention slow? The worst app on my phone",2024-03-23

4,Been a fan for years.,2024-01-17
1,This is the fourth time I've had to jump through hoops just to delete an account that was automatically generated. I am not happy I actually have to waste my time deleting another account I never wanted because I accidentally clicked another reddit link before realizing. Only typing this so it's here for all to see now. Just STOP auto generating accounts! I would rather be stopped by a login screen so I can leave before that. You might just end up paying people like me for our time if you don't.,2024-01-03
5,very good,2024-02-03

5,Nice,2024-02-03
1,"you need a $1000 phone to run smoothly. Reddit is just a really bad company, and they are full of very liberal racists, lots of sub reddits are about hating a person, place, or idea. Their admins allow promotion of drug use, drug sales, minor abuse, elder abuse, violence, hate, and mountains of political propaganda. It's full of adult content, pornography, and fetish type things that are illegal in many places.",2024-03-09
1,Reddit is obviously a biased platform that is run by liberals. It's a shame that this country is so divided. And platforms like this are making it worse. 0 stars,2024-03-31

5,honestly the best app tbh,2023-12-02
1,Can't login anymore. Literally unusable,2024-03-20
4,"Way better than Discord, but so often people go with default settings that don't let you post more than one pic or video to show a before and after type thing... And you can't edit the title once posted. Great community for looking topics up instead of trying to find DIscord invite links. Mostly in love but doggonit.",2024-03-10

1,"Constant crashes, posts repeating, this app sucks. 6 months later and I can no longer access my subscribed subreddits or any profile. Thanks for convincing me I don't need reddit anymore!",2024-02-11
1,"Features don't work and it's always changing which one it is when you open the app. Even if you get through to the content, you're still on Reddit and that's just a site full of the worst most miserable losers on the planet. So, I can't see a reason to ever use this.",2024-01-20
5,I don't see no problems so far and it's great to read the stories,2023-11-10
1,After recent update app is complete broken and no pages will load.,2024-03-19
1,Buggy app ban you for nothing,2023-12-24
3,Audio issue on videos. Audio plays before you scroll to video causing overlap. Swiping to view photos in a post takes you to another post. Too many other issues to list.,2024-01-29
1,"Well, couldn't think it'd get any worse, it actually did. Really the UI was bad now the last update made it worse? Adding extra clicks won't solve the problem. And what's up with the posts whenever I scroll, I'm not able to see anything anymore even after it's refreshing. Useless for me at this point.",2024-03-24
4,I had fun using this app to check videos community and even just plain old fun there is a mix of different kind of content in each video but its fun to use,2024-03-24

1,Reddit should be embarrassed by this app. Terrible ux,2024-01-27
1,"Whole site's circling the drain, but it's been going downhill for years. Mods are powertripping shut-ins and the admins are even worse. Got notifications from reddit itself two weeks ago begging for money for their IPO, now banned after I ignored them. Should've known it would come to this when they froze out third party apps. Done with this trash app, after twelve years they're dead to me.",2024-03-12

1,It sucks to search for something on Google and results from this site come up. If I'm not paying attention I'll end up in a loop of the thus website BEGGING me to download the app until I can get out and back to my browser... where I was and wanted to remain in the first place.,2024-02-12
1,"Banned for pathetic reason, i mistakenly joined a group from another account from which i was banned for joining other group which they don't like.(there is a yr gap) And now my all accounts are permanently banned. Improvise this pathetic action.",2023-11-21

5,The discussions keeps my nerves awake,2023-11-13
1,"The only problem I have with this app is that it shadowbans new redditors for no absolute reason, I created two different accounts and both of them were banned for no reason. I've already deleted it and I'm much happier now. I advise you to not install it at all because it's full of toxic mods who will literally ban you for having an unpopular opinion, any account you create eventually gets banned within 24 hours.",2023-12-18
1,"Worse UI, can't save gifs, can't save videos, can't save images from an album. But there's not many choices.",2023-11-13
5,"I love the app but for pictures I wish that you could add download or add other images and I wish we could update it to where people could reply to massages so people wont get confused. And Also should allow people to make their own guidelines and Allow people to put tags in their post If they want to keep the community on track, Instead of making an optional. Make sure people see downvote too and not only upvote all the time.",2023-12-12
1,Neckbeard moderators run this app along with the subreddits. They're the lowest scum creatures of this Earth.,2023-11-02

1,"2022/01/30: I really had fun with this app up until the recent update. Since then, I'll be lucky if I can even get in, only for the app to stop working the moment I try to access anything other than the Popular Feed. Update: 2023/12/19: I just woke up after a nearly two year coma and now I can't even open the app after reinstalling?! 2 years Reddit, and the bugs on your app seemed to have gotten worse?! How the actual F, is that possible?",2023-12-19

4,better than other social media,2024-02-23
1,"""See this post in Reddit app"" prompts from the mobile browser that intentionally ruins the experience. They intentionally got rid of the ""Ask to open in app"" toggle in the settings. It's been a constant barrage of pushing users to this unnecessary app at the expense of the ease of use on other platforms. Now they are targeting 3rd party apps. Old.reddit will probably follow. I will not use this app. It requires permissions, it will have data tracking, waste of my battery, storage, etc.",2024-03-15

1,"This ""gestures"" update is awful. You're supposed to swipe up from the bottom to get to the comments on a post, but if you have gesture navigation on in Android, you swipe up from the bottom to go back. So in the same gesture, Reddit's moving to a new page, and Android's receiving a ""back"" prompt, which undoes the action of opening the comments, which means if you open a picture in full screen you can't go back unless you tap it and tap the X, instead of using the device's universal ""back"" action",2024-03-20

2,Not as clean or intuitive as other app options that are no longer available. App seems to randomly decide whether the sound for certain videos will be playable. Search function works pretty well.,2023-12-05

1,"I dislike when APPs ask .. are you enjoying the app? If you answer yes, it brings you here to rate.. assuming you'll rate positive. If you answer no, they'll bring you to give your feedback privately. Seems a tad dishonest to me.",2023-12-06

2,"Well what can i say. An app that forces you to be fake nice. An app full of power hungy moderators. An app that allows manipulation and agendas as long as there "" fake nice"". It got 2 stars because it is nice to connect with people sometimes.",2024-02-26
1,This app is complete garbage compared to reddit is fun.,2023-12-07
1,"Every update makes the app run worse. Videos are incredibly glitchy, can't even click open posts most of the times now.",2023-11-03
5,"Reddit has been great. The community is respectful overall, and ideas are shared so freely that it's easy to find and learn more about the things you love or don't love yet.",2023-11-20
1,"Lot's of bullying and often rage baiting ultimately a poor and upsetting experience. Don't want to comment on anything you don't know who's going to end up harassing you because your opinion might be slightly different. Feels uncomfortable and unsafe and the harrassment is very personal. Was fun for a short period, USE WITH CAUTION! Just went to check it out again dam disgusting topics nah deleted not worth getting constantly harassed even if you change your name very unsafe app.",2024-03-08
5,Super,2024-03-26
1,"Everything about this platform has gotten significantly worse in the last year. With the disabling of 3rd-party apps, most of the serious utility for professionals and hobbyists has been sidelined in favor of algorithmically-fed content aimed at teenagers. Gone is the ability to tailor your feed to your interests: you are constantly fed random posts, unrelated to your interests, and managing them in your feed becomes exhausting. They have turned a useful platform into a toy for children.",2023-11-18

1,Can't leave a comment. Attempting to post a reply causes the app to crash. Very useless. The feed seems to be filtered. Some Reddit communities are just not assessable with the official app. And I do not know why.,2023-12-06
5,Only site like it. Literal never-ending content on an infinite amount of subject matter. Something for everyone! World's WITTIEST,2024-01-30

1,Reddit changed their API terms to effectively get rid of all 3rd party applications. Now they won't even allow you to access the site via a web browser on your phone. This app is a necessity only because of their policies.,2023-11-25

4,😃 AWESOME,2024-02-29
2,"Reddit moderators are poor quality to be polite, ban people for posting quotes laws and I believe (suspect) cops who are mods do not like people who say correct things against cops and they ban people for posting those laws. r/news is full of punks like this, making this a corrupt cops dream, censorship of people that cops do not like.",2024-03-20
5,I never fail finding help with any games or anything when I reach out to Reddit,2024-03-13
1,"Where to start. I have been using the app for years, and people have been complaining about the UI for a long time. To me, it was alright so far, but the latest update(s) seem to have made it completely unusable. Why are there posts determined by the algorithm in my home feed? If I wanted to find something I'm not subbed to, I'd use the popular feed. And it keeps showing things again and again from subs I've said I'm not interested in. I only updated for the recap and now I regret it.",2023-12-10

1,"Since the last update, clicking on posts has been unusable. The new swipe feature is unnecessary. It used to automatically load the comment section but now I have to tap to load the comments.",2024-03-22
5,Love it!,2024-03-17
2,"Recent update has the top comment hidden. The only way I can find to reveal the comment is to click the ad, then nav back to the Reddit app... miraculous. I'm about to uninstall... Fix this, plz. Alternatively, a comment is duplicated.",2024-03-18

5,Great,2024-01-13
1,"What a dummy factory this site is. One post every 72 hours, chat invite limits. Bogus hit counts. App says you have chats when you don't, doesn't tell you when you actually do. What a Jughead app. Junk site, junk stock.",2024-03-29

5,Loving it,2024-02-13
5,"Reddit is a unique conversation space in today's world. It isn't quite the old message boards of yester-year (4-and 8- chan have filled that space I believe) but it also isn't the social media powerhouse like the Facebooks of the world. Instead it has become a treasure of information and a fun little spot to enjoy some good conversation, get so e good advice, and to share experiences and questions in a relatively non-toxic space (here looking at you X and Instagram 0_0). I give it my thumbs up.",2024-01-25

1,"I downloaded this app 4 years ago and the ui was fine, minor issues but only in places that didn't matter so much. Now the ui is constantly changed and it's hard to use the app as the buttons are thrown all over the place. Video player was broked for a year until they fixed it, then broke it, and i had to redownload the app to fix it. The image viewer was the only thing that stayed consistent, Now with a recent update, it's all over the place like the video player.",2024-03-20

1,"So confusing to use. I was using one of the apps recently terminated to access reddit which was much less complicated and I was forced into using this now and I hate it. Tons of ads and things I dont want to see, this is exactly no different than all the other social media platforms, which is not the experience I was having before. I dont need notifications or suggestions or ad posts or custom characters or to socialize with anyone, so much scrolling! I now hate reddit and hardly use it. Thanks",2024-01-29

1,"Awful app. It's so slow compared to every other social media app. Open comments and it freezes and jumps around every time.

The app is somewhat buggy, and has a big problem with swiping motions including scrolling (!?!). The arbitrary selection of what posts are shown to me has lead to me needing to unsub from quite a few subs that kept being relentlessly shoved down my throat. Other subs I barely see posts from... I could go on and on, but this app simply kills the joys of reddit for me.",2024-03-09

1,"Plagued With Tyrannical Moderators This app could be exceptional, but it's plagued with far too many tyrannical moderators or mods. Most of these mods run their forums like a dictatorship. They're rude, unprofessional, abusive, and power hungry. They'll ban you from groups for any reason they choose, and nothing can be done about it. They spew insulting remarks knowing well you can't defend yourself. Reddit has allowed this behavior as long as I've been a user and let these mods ruin it.",2024-03-30

4,Great app. Informative videos.,2024-02-18
1,The most recent update has made this app absolutely unusable. It logs me out every time I close the app. It isn't loading comments and will shut down often if I try to add a comment. I mean it when I say that it has become legitimately unusable.,2023-12-11
5,A must have app,2023-12-08
5,It's options and speed is top notch,2023-11-29
1,"1. The company has taken away the ability to use third party applications to browse the website. This means you have to deal with their terrible app maintenance, like how I'm unable to make comments as the app crashes. 2. They have given themselves permission to sell your data to third party companies. Only place where this isn't the case is the EU. The problem with reddit is more fundamental now. As both as service provide and company. It's too late to ask for change now.",2023-12-05

5,Love the stories on here,2024-03-11
1,"The ""new"" app is ridiculous. To find my posts I have to click avatar - karma - my profile. Who came up with the idea that you have to press karma? Not intuitive. Saved posts are no where to be seen. Used to be an awkward scroll of the tiniest bottom part of the screen, now that doesn't work. And the moon to the right of the settings button doesn't even fit on the screen, I can only see the very edge of it.",2024-03-13

1,"It's such a huge platform but the app is so glitchy and slow. So dissapointing. The bigger your account gets, the more problems it has.",2024-03-21
1,Crashes. Loses your position in the comment section. Certain pop up banners perma block content. Swiping through gallery posts on the home feed is janky and often takes you to the useless popular feed. Would have given a 0/5 if given the chance. Bring back 3rd party apps.,2024-01-21
1,You search in Google and you find answer on reddit. You press the link and get error. It forces you to log in. OK. After log in it asks you to open in the app. You press OK and then you get the main page and not what you were looking for. Reddit pop up ask if you enjoy the app. No I don't. It offer you to report the reason but lead you to search solutions. Are you kidding me?,2024-02-25

Although, it would be better, I think if it could warn me before telling me, AFTER, I have made concerted efforts at quite a thoughtful reply to many posts posed, be so whatever the subject matters are, and then says take a timeout, for y number of minutes.

1,"This app is such a disappointment. The ads are intrusive. The functionality is incredibly limited. The layout is horrible. Not being able to do normal navigation, as on the website, is a disgrace.

4,"In general, I enjoy Reddit over other social media (which is a Reddit thing to say), I prefer the anonymous users and kind of people that use it. But speaking solely from app use, I'm constantly running into glitches such as: scrolling up a bit will send me back to the top of the page, copies of the same comment being sent out, images taking forever to load, or videos will sometimes automatically turn on sound and blast my speakers. I enjoy Reddit, but the mobile can be annoying.",2023-12-12

1,Absolute trash. I downloaded the app because Steve (fart)huffer is killing third party apps. Somehow the reddit app scrolls at 20fps on a brand new OnePlus 11.

Genuinely not a useful app, as nothing loads quickly. I can't wait 30 secs or longer waiting for each individual post to load it's not reasonable. I cannot believe how awful this app is. Why don't the developers care? If I say I'm not interested in a post, I don't want to see 50 identical posts for the next week!",2023-11-30

1,You messed up the video player by updating it.,2024-01-05
1,This app requires access to your files in order to save pictures. Most other apps can save pictures without this access. Double tap to like is an abomination and should be an option to turn off. The screen stays on if you are looking at the comments on a video. Clicking the thumbnail of a post is inconsistent with how it opens.,2024-03-06

3,"Standard modern tech hellscape where the app is okay and the website is awful to push people towards the app because they can legally stalk you more and also use push notifications to try and get your engagement up.

1,Worst video player in existence. I would rather deepthroat a gun barrel than try to get your video player to work.

It's visually draining with little notifications and flashy menu items all over the screen. There is barely any way to customize this headache-inducing experience because reddit has no intention of making this app usable or user friendly, they only to monopolize how you can access their page. Browser sucks too",2024-03-09
1,"The app sucks. There are constant random UI changes, no ability to change ad preferences, and if I scroll for more than 15 minutes, reddit has an aneurysm and shuts down.

An appeal explaining they were wrong was met with a ""Nope."" Blessing in disguise, really.

5,This rating was forced. 😆,2023-12-03
1,I would give it less if I could. The app still eats through data like a starved child that hasn't seen food in a decade and they purposefully added malicious API pricings to kill off non-official apps all while their app is still broken,2023-12-07
5,Goldmine of information,2024-03-02

1,Probably the worst app on this platform...it keeps crushing and takes forever to load a simple image,2023-11-14
1,I hate that the browser tries to kick you to the app every time. If I wanted to use it I would. I'm not using it on purpose because it's completely pointless. Reddit killed the alt apps so now I use it. It's an awful app. Why does it highlight upvotes? Not a fan. Why is it showing trending without allowing me to disappear it? I have no interest in any of that stuff. Trash app. I hate that they got rid of RIF which was better in every way.,2023-10-28
5,i love this app,2024-03-04

1,"The new look crops the top line of text out of videos usually and why on God's green earth would you think that having us tap a tiny square instead of just the image was a good idea? Try and open a spoiler image and you have to open the entire post instead of just being able to see the image. They got rid of the small button then brought it back with a stupid button at the top when scrolling through a post that never goes away and if it's a video, will have it play the video which is annoying",2023-12-13

1,What a piece if cr@p! Reddit blocked 3rd party apps to deliver this buggy and slow mess. It's like they are asking the users to go away (!).,2024-02-10
1,This app fails to work regularly. It doesn't allow me to use Reddit in a way that I enjoy. This app will eventually drive me away from Reddit.,2023-11-08
1,U get 1 star for forcing me to download your app just for an answer. Count ur blessings and stop being needy 😘,2023-12-10

4,Lots of knowledge in a variety of subjects,2024-01-27
1,"What a shame. This app is extremely unstable, laggy and has an awful UI that's hard to navigate. It, along with their anti-competitive decision to force all other far better alternative apps out were the reason that I finally left Reddit after more than 15 years. It's very obvious that the decision makers at Reddit don't respect or care about their user base anymore. What was once ""the front page of the internet"" is now no better than a junkmail pamphlet. It was fun while it lasted.",2023-11-15

1,Terrible app compared to 90% of the smaller apps made by indie developers in their basements that reddit crushed a few months ago. the main complaints is that audio rarely plays properly on video and that there isint much customization if you dont like the way the UI is laid out already.,2024-01-05

App freezes whenever you try opening a thread, looking at a photo, playing a video, browsing a subreddit, posting a comment, looking at notifications, making a search, looking through a profile, going through saved posts, going through history, making a post, et. cetera. Rampant, encouraged mod abuse means it's not even worth trying to use the app, not that it's usable in the first place. Every update just makes the app worse. Absolute garbage.",2023-11-28

1,"App keeps suggesting me different subreddits that I have no interest in. If I so much as Google something that pulls up a subreddit, suddenly I'm getting notifications for an obscure video game I was just curious about. I don't need to get a notification every time somebody posts on the Lies of P subreddit. I accidentally upvote something constantly, and have to go back in and un-upvote it. App is awful.

1,"130,000 subreddits, but if you don't want to view pornography, hate speech, and gore you can only block 1,000 of them. Good luck! This app is full of hate content and right wing conspiracies.

I'm fairly certain that they ban people who report inappropriate material so that they don't have to respond to as many reports.",2023-12-07

1,Updating 1/29/24 - Still absolute hot garbage. Promoted fake ads every 4 posts. App refreshes itself every time you open it so you never pick up where you left off. Impossible to navigate. Messy. Bad features. Ads disguised as content. Reddit was loved for it's simplicity and ease of use. All of this extra garbage everywhere on screen just makes the experience so horrible. It's beyond comprehension how ANYONE can think this is a product worth forcing everyone to use. TRASH.,2024-01-29
1,**If you haven't use an ad blocker or ad blocking VPN to kill ads in this app! I've been using Reddit Sync for 12+ years. I was using it before Reddit even had an app and you take it away and force this garbage on me. Shameful! Edit: It's still garbage. That's all. (02/15/2024),2024-02-16

1,"Garbage: After the switch from third party I had to use this app. It's terrible. If I try to collapse the first comment in a thread, it immediately pops back. If I hide a video because I'm tired of seeing the same videos over and over (which you push because you want to be tiktok or insta reels), as soon as I close and open app they're all back.

1,Why does this company suck so much? It's like they don't test new updates before sending them out. All the videos start playing before I scroll to them so like 3 things are audio at once,2024-01-30

4,Lots of fun.,2023-11-20
1,"This app is horrendous. Every other post is a sponsored post. The app also keeps shoving subreddits in my face I have no interest in. Then there is the video... My gawd, most can't play with sound, videos not on screen start playing and don't stop regardless of scrolling way down or opening a post. No wonder they forced 3rd parties out, those companies were actually making efficient products",2024-02-09

1,"Please stop with all the recommendations. The ads are bad enough, but every other post of my feed is a recommendation for a subreddit that I'm not interested in. For example, just because I follow one sports team doesn't mean I want every single team recommended to me.",2024-03-06
1,"Total mess and it gets worse after each update. Don't get me wrong, the UI is excellent but the overall UX is plain torture; you tap on a post WITHOUT IMAGES and sometimes it loads literally nothing not even comments (even after 15 minutes of just leaving it there), opening posts with pictures is basically playing roulette at this point - maybe they will load and open, maybe they won't - trying to check posts and comments on someone's profile is no different... Wasting too much time for NOTHING.",2024-02-14

1,"Barely useable... The new swipe gestures aren't optional and make everything super clunky. My Home page won't even load anything anymore, meaning I have to go to individual communities just to look for posts... What is going on? They paywalled the API so third-party apps have to charge users to use them, and then made the default app literally unusable... What a waste of effort.",2024-02-04
1,Full of irrelevant stuff recommended,2024-01-25
2,"Doesn't open its own URLs reliably. Loses half-written posts/comments when it happens to get swapped out by the system because you got a phone call while you were writing them. Fifteen years ago these would have counted as crude, amateurish oversights; today they are unforgivable.",2024-02-10

4,Stay out of the political threads and avoided the home page (because it's 65% political) and it's amazing! Otherwise it's a dumpster fire! If your onto hobbies it's great for learning more and seeing what other people are doing.,2023-11-16
1,As a first time user this app is very off putting. I was told to download it to be able to share my photography but i try to post in the groups you have to join and nothing will ever post. There's so many ruled you cant even do anything.,2024-03-27

1,"(update). Still leaving at 1. The stuttering gone but navigating still sucks. Reddit on mobile browser better at this point. New bug of getting audio of post above post I'm reading comments of.

1,"You may visit sports, rpg, photography, and cute pet picture subreddits every day for a year. But if you click on ONE r/politics post IT'S ALL OVER! That is your front page forever. Reddit runs on a rage algorithm like other social media. It is desperate to make you angry. It's also bad to the mods who make it livable. Finally, it needlessly removed third party apps. Reddit, you want to be the only game in town? Stop being terrible at everything you do.",2023-11-14

There's things I say/express in some groups that I wouldn't even say to some of my friends but being as noone ""knows"" or will know makes it so much easier. Also there is a great sense of community here and some of the groups have truly helped me overcome some rather personal issues. I love it.

1,"Slight edit: Currently can't even log into the app anymore, just keep getting an error. Account is okay as I can log in on desktop. App's just abysmal, even when not compared to 3rd party apps it's just objectively bad. It runs sluggish and sometimes it just randomly decides to autoscroll. Tapping anywhere on a video except the pixel perfect comment icon will fullscreen it and ignore autoplay settings. Often it's genuinely hard to tell the difference between posts and ads. Overall just garbage.",2024-01-30

On top of all that, I don't know how to use Reddit yet. Having said all that, it's become a source of great humor to me. It's been an invaluable resource to get 'answers' to questions that are rarely even discussed in the mainstream. Too much else to list - So Far, So Good! Thanks Redditt =)",2023-11-16

Half of the groups don't let you post, even though that's the point. I'll read the rules and still get my post removed for something stupid.

5,Very informative and my small business is growing slowly but surely! Thanks Reddit!,2023-11-27
1,Ads are displayed inline with posts making it very hard to determine what is an ad and what is user content. Videos fail to load about 50% of the time. Not worth using. Also random ad audio starts playing when opening some posts. It's one of the worst apps I've used in a long time. Really appreciate reddit killing all the third party apps that actually made their product usable. 🤦🏻‍♂️,2024-03-12

Removing 3rd party apps accelerated the process dramatically.

5,Reasons and stuff,2024-03-28
3,I don't know what they did to this app recently but it's gotten super annoying. As your scrolling it likes to start playing audio from a video from post that are like four or five above where you're looking at depending on the direction you're scrolling. I have to turn audio on and off in between scrolling each post so that it's not just this constant replaying of the exact same sound over and over.,2024-01-28

1,The speech freedom in fact does not exist on here and disagreement with the opinion of the far left is considered a crime on this app and WILL get you banned.

There are some other small things here and there that are annoying, but those are the big three. Please fix them.",2024-03-17

1,App's downvoting feature ensures only sweet and cute comments are allowed by redditors. These sweet and cute comments usually are totally incorrect. Why do we need downvote button? why not just have an upvote button? Why does reddit wants to allow only sweet and cute but not unpopular opinions? Isn't this against the whole freedom of expression? This must be raised at all levels.,2023-11-12
1,"Who ever updated the UI of this app should be fired. Made a simple task of sliding through pictures extremely complex. Sliding sideways takes me into the next post, instead of the next picture. Disabled the download feature on posts with multiple pictures.",2023-11-11

1,"Why do I need an app to do what the website already can? You know your app is good when you force users onto it. Recently, the app made it so you can't obtain direct links of posted content. You can't open them in a browser or copy and paste a URL; you must share the Reddit post directly, should you want to send someone the original source of content. Clearly this is to recruit more users. The app is marginally useful, but it persists with features that are pathetic, desperate, and shoehorned.",2023-11-23
5,Reddit is awesome. It helped with my depression. When I was in a really dark place I would go to subreddits of successful and happy people to understand what I was doing wrong. I would read through them and realize that other people were people too and I wasn't this one off depressed idiot. I saw that people turned their lives around all the time and it made me feel so good. As long as you do not echo chamber yourself into sad and depressing things reddit is great.,2024-02-10

Update; videos still don't work. It is still the least functional social media app in the market. Now, top comment in thread collapses, without input, so you unintentionally hit the ad.

1,"Giphy hasn't been working on the app anymore, and it's super irritating. The New U.I. It pretty much just sucks all around. It's really annoying and disappointing and making me contemplate finally saying goodbye to Reddit for good.",2024-02-25
5,Great,2023-12-08
1,"Extremely clunky compared to some 3rd party apps. Too many ads. For some reason, you can't remove communities from custom feeds or delete custom feeds. Also, the settings don't work all the time (e.g. I set 'autoplay' to 'never,' but it autoplays every time anyway. Horrible all around.",2023-11-19

1,They had to remove API access. And the app is still unuseable,2023-12-11
1,Useless,2024-03-29
2,"Overall user experience is ok, but the embedded ads in both post listings and in comments (sometimes pinned and trying to disguise themselves as genuine comments/posts) are beyond intrusive. Finally had enough and uninstalled it today. I don't necessarily mind ads and understand their necessity, but the implementation on this app is just unbearable. If this improves in the future, I may use this app again, but for now I will be looking elsewhere.",2024-02-10
1,"This new update is absolutely trash. Why make the video and pictures small when you open the comments? Maybe I want to look at the comments while actually watching the video? Maybe someone points something out and I want to get a closer look in the picture? And the swiping to go to another post is just stupid. I was scrolling through some pictures and suddenly they were completely irrelevant with no obvious ""hey, this is a different post!"" Absolutely garbage",2024-03-12

1,"Terrible. I used to have an iphone. Reddit app was okay. 3.5 stars. On an android, its borderline unusable.

1,"Reddit is censorship at its absolute worst. I shared a public officials' very ""public information"" from a .gov website, and I was automatically and permanently banned without any human intervention whatsoever. This is a country founded on freedoms! Freedom of speech and freedom to exercise that right! Reddit's platform allows for discriminate banning based solely on political hushing or speaking against their political ideological perspective. This is a dangerous app to avoid at all costs!",2024-03-09

1,"I was going to give two stars, but they lost one for constantly begging for a review. You look desperate when you do that, Reddit. And the reason for two stars in the first place? I don't like their sub recommendations and I HATE that ""Reddit cares"" bs #1 no you don't care. And I'm NEVER going to believe that one #2 it's used to bully people and blocking it isn't an option, of course. My mental health is worse after getting one of those messages than it ever was before.

1,"This app is so broken. My subscribed Reddit list has vanished, the chat features are broken, I only get a ""Retry"" button when trying to view any specific user profile, and it's just generally difficult to navigate this app. Hard to believe y'all had people making free functioning apps for Reddit and you cut off access and forced everyone into your piss poor app that you're struggling to develop.
