4.0,"DH got his first bottle of Baxter of California Daily Protein Shampoo free and has been buying it ever since. Then he added the conditioner and Super Close Shave Formula to his regime. I expected he'd love the Shave Tonic when I accepted a bottle to review. Indeed, he tried it and was enamored with it, but it isn't a product that he will use and buy regularly. Specifically, he loves the scent and says it feels wonderful, but says it didn't work so great, or feel so different, that he'd stop using the Super Close Shave Formula. So, definitely liked, just not liked as much as his other Baxter grooming products.",1478563200,2016-11-08
5.0,"I am loving this color.  It's a pretty red, with a hint of pink to it, so I can wear my deeper pinks with it.  It is demanding of certain colors though, so not a universal pink / red color if there is such a thing.",1378166400,2013-09-03

1.0,"Did not curl my hair at all and I used it sometimes three times in the same spot. This type of iron also doesn't let you curl the very ends as you have to hold them with your fingers. Heats fast, has automatic shut off--at least that's in its favor, but for me, it didn't do anything but curl my ends. I will just use rollers. Lot less heat damage and more curl. I do like the fact this comes with a travel bag, but I don't see myself taking it anywhere as it does not work. Not sure what I think of the glove. Found it hindering.",1517788800,2018-02-05

5.0,"Dermablend has a great product lineup with some great camouflage blends. From heavy to lighter coverage they all feature some amount of SPF protection.
I really like the quality and feel of it. It leaves skin feeling smooth and is not greasy nor sticky. The texture is silky which is a nice surprise.
The coverage is excellent and a little goes a long way. Even applied to large areas like the legs and body.
It has good water and sweat resistance and stays on well. A quick scrub with a good skin cleanser and water washes it off. You do have to put some effort into it.
Great foundation and camo. Professional strength is right.",1499472000,2017-07-08

5.0,"I have been using premier designer skin care brands for so many years but this Obaji moisturizer is working by far the best for me. Throughout the day I don't reapply my makeup but I found that due to my dry skin my foundation looks cracked around my nose and cheeks towards later in the day.
After using this moisturizer, my skin is not only glowing but I don't find my face cracking later in the day. :)
You only need a little amount and it doesn't leave me greasy or feeling heavy.

I love this moisturizer and am soooo glad I found it!",1497225600,2017-06-12
4.0,"I was really impressed with how smoothly this applies to the skin. It really has a nice, silky feel to it. The color blends in nicely to my foundation adding a bit of color without it seeming overly noticeable. I liked how easy it was to apply and it lasted well throughout the day.

I've used cream blushes in the past, but this is probably one of the best ones I've tried. It has nice pigmentation, it blends nicely, and it looks natural.",1494633600,2017-05-13
4.0,"This foundation is lighter than the Dermablend Mousse and takes more to get full coverage.  It also leaves my face feeling more oily than the mousse but not enough to create a shine or make my glasses slide off.  The coverage is smooth with no lines or streaks.  The directions on the bottle are for sunscreen and not for applying makeup but the description on the amazon page gives good instruction for the novice.  I applied a light powder over the top and have received several comments that I look really nice today, in spite of wearing a t-shirt and jeans.  This foundation did a pretty good job covering the blotches and red spots I have from rosacea.",1498089600,2017-06-22
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20
4.0,This product was a really awesome item. I I'm starting to thin at the middle of my scalp. This product legitimately fattens the individual hair fibers and conceals the exposed skin on the scalp. I highly recommend you buy this product if you are dealing with the same. You will not be disappointed.,1453766400,2016-01-26
4.0,"First thought: rich, floral, heady..in your face to start with.  Relax, it mellows and you're able to be aware of the different parts.  I can kind of pick out the vanilla and magnolia.  It becomes more subtle but still really is a night time fragrance.that can be smelled on your skin hours later.  It reminds me of Shalimar..in the sense that you wouldn't put that on to go to work but it's intensity is perfect for nights.  Rochas is a well known perfume maker in Paris and this is a generously sized bottle for the price..enjoy!",1423440000,2015-02-09
3.0,"On the plus side: this mascara goes on neatly, doesn't clump and has good staying power.  It's also fairly easy to remove.
However: it doesn't seem to thicken or lengthen my lashes at all.  There is nothing dramatic about this mascara.  I wouldn't consider switching to this from any drugstore brand.",1397692800,2014-04-17
5.0,"Many years ago I had a green concealer stick that neutralized red places on my face.  I hadn't used one or even seen one for years, until I saw this Japonesque correcting crayon on Amazon.  Both of my college age daughters have times when their face breaks out and they want to cover the redness, so I ordered this stick for them.

First of all, it's big (4 inches long and .3 ounce of product) and will last a long time.  I like that it rolls up like a lipstick, and that it goes on smoothly.  It's a light green color, which is the ""opposite"" of red and neutralizes blemishes or reddish areas in skin. Just dab a tiny dot of the green on the problem area, blend and the spot disappears.  I used a bit just to get a feel for it, and it really does make redness disappear.  It doesn't leave your face looking green, though, and you can use foundation or powder over the top of it.

Both daughters were very happy with this correcting crayon, and now I suppose I have to buy a second one to prevent fighting.  It seems a little expensive at $22, but when you find a good quality product that works well it's worth it.",1439596800,2015-08-15

5.0,"I have been using the Proraso shave cream with great success.  I purchased this ""Soap in the Bowl"" to support a recent vacation as I did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl.  This product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube, I did not experience any break-outs as a result.  This is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates.",1498867200,2017-07-01

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

Associated gear: Parker 99R safety razor; Boker Tree Brand straight razor; Escali Badger Hair brush; Proraso Green pre-shave.",1438473600,2015-08-02
4.0,For those times when skin needs to be shown and you have a scar or blemish that really needs to be covered up - this is a good product to get you through.  It's easy to apply and works well - great to have on hand.,1502150400,2017-08-08

3.0,"With Mont Blanc I expect luxury and the packaging of Star Walker Eau de Toilette announces this.  The square glass bottle projects high quality as one thinks about a solid piece of heavy glass with what highly resembles a machined metal cap with the Mont Blanc snow cap on top.  It/s not a stretch to say expectations are high as one of my all time favorite scents is Mont Blanc's Legend Intense.  By this admission you can guess I prefer bold scents just as long as they're refined and complex enough to warrant being so.  But, this is a review for Star Walker, I went in to some of the former to make a point, however, and that point is the differences between Legend Intense and Starwalker.

Star walker a mixture of bergamot, tangerine, bamboo, ginger, sandalwood, white musk, amber, and nutmeg according to the manufacturer.  It's much more light and sweet than one would imagine by the ingredients.  In fact it was so light and sweet minutes after you put it on you won't be able to personally smell it - as this mixture is one of those your nose will acclimate to, and null out, within a short period.  However, others will still be able to pick up on Star Walker and this is where it gets mixed reviews from me.  While it was a pleasant primarily sweet smell when I applied it to both neck and undershirt, my wife thought it was way feminine smelling.  Bingo, she got it in a nutshell!  While not necessarily bad, my penchant for bold fragrances does not in any fashion include what I will bottom line as:  airy, sweet, and feminine - my take away on Star Walker.  This fragrance fits into what I call UNI-SEX FRAGRANCES.  In this realm its appeals to the few women I've asked if they'd wear it.  If you're interested in Star Walker it seems to be available at attractive prices at present.  This may be a result of Mont Blanc no longer showing it on their website.  One last thing, while I couldn't smell it almost immediately I asked my wife if she could at the end of the day when we both came home.  She could still smell it within a reasonable close proximity she said.  I would have not thought this possible since right after putting Star Walker on my nose was immune.  Mont Blanc's Legend Intense is still their best fragrance IMHO.  This could be considered their answer to a warmer weather scent.",1458432000,2016-03-20
4.0,"I like this serum, a few drops and it smooths evenly over my whole face.  I haven't noticed a cooling sensation when applying, but it does absorb quickly and leaves my skin soft.  I have skin that is prone to breaking out, so I pick products carefully that are for sensitive skin.  This serum didn't cause any break outs while using it, and may have kept the pimples at bay.  I didn't notice a fragrance in the serum, it smelled faintly of medicine. It is a light blue color, but it wasn't noticeable after blending in my skin.  All in all I like how this serum makes my skin feel soft.",1478563200,2016-11-08
4.0,"I usually use NailEnvy for my severely weakened nails.  I am happy to see this really sheer pink on my nails.  It looks pretty.

My nail problem is causing me some difficulty.  They have become very weak.  I am having a protein problem that is just ungainly.  I have been seeing a nutritionist for over a year and she said once my nail and hair became problems, I would know I am not getting on top of it.

5.0,"Once upon a time, I used a somewhat similar molding paste called PureHair Watercress.  Unfortunately, that product was discontinued, and I've been searching for a replacement for some time.  V76 by Vaughn Molding Paste seems like a great replacement, as it performs similarly or better than PureHair.

The nice thing about this molding paste is its balance.  It's not too heavy, not too light.  Offers terrific body without flattening or weighing your hair down.  Can work great for all lengths of hair (mine is on the short side).

Really a fine product.  Nice light scent too.

I was provided a sample for evaluation purposes, but there's a good chance I'll continue buying it once I'm out of the stuff.  5 stars.",1480550400,2016-12-01
5.0,"This is a fairly thick, cream conditioner and it has worked very well for me. The ends of my hair tend to get dry and I've been using this conditioner with each wash. I've noticed a big difference in how much less dry my ends are. It goes on easily and the scent is mild and pleasant. It takes slightly more rinsing than other conditioners I've used, but perhaps that's part of why it works so well. It was easy to squeeze out of the tube when it was full, but it gets a little harder as the product is used up. The 6.8 ounce size lasted a good amount of time since I used some just on the bottom third of my hair each time. I would go through it quite quickly if I used it more. Overall, it makes my hair look healthy and I'm happy with this product.",1494028800,2017-05-06
4.0,"As I get older my hair has lost some bounce and smoothness and has become more brittle and difficult to manage. I have used and have been willing to use almost anything that would help the condition of the ends of my hair. This ORIBE INTENSE CONDITIONER has worked great for me. I started using it after every shampoo, but find that I only need to use it about every other time now. The smell is luxurious, with a slight spice and freshness to it. It only takes a small amount to the ends of my hair and then I worked it back towards the scalp. It is the quality product that I expected from ORIBE.  Granted, its so expensive, but this tube should last me a good while.",1493251200,2017-04-27

I use two pumps over my entire face and neck, smoothing it into my skin for a minute until it totally absorbs.  My skin feels wonderfully smooth. I really think the product has improved the texture of my skin.  I also really like the delivery system of this cream:  it's measured, prevents oxidizing, and is sanitary.  And thankfully it doesn't contain any parabens,  It is pricey, but I expect it to last quite a long time.  I hope to try the tinted mineral sunscreen next.",1503705600,2017-08-26

The charge time on this shaver is very long, at least twelve hours for a full charge, but it's difficult to tell because it does not have an indicator.

4.0,"Results are promising, even after one week. I do believe that my face is a little smoother and softer. The bottle indicated I would see the effects after 7 days and even more after 30. Just use a few drops and there is enough for my face, forehead and neck. I have been using it day and night, per the directions. This is a costly item, so I try to not use more drops than necessary. One drawback is that there is really no set of instructions on how much to use. The ingredients are only available after you receive the product. On the good side, there do no appear to be any parabens in the ingredients.

I will update after 30 days to see if there is even more of a youthful appearance.",1419120000,2014-12-21

5.0,"The color of ""Lucky"" given online I think matches the color it is well. Notice the very slight orangey color. Seeing the lipstick up close, I do not notice the orange, but once applied I see it much better. It makes the lipstick pop and not so much blend in with the natural color of your lips. The subtle citrus smell of the lipstick was a pleasant surprise. It goes on smooth and feels moist. After eating lunch and hanging out at home(about 4 hours) the color has worn off a bit and needs to be reapplied. I think it is a reasonable amount of time and not a nuisance. The packaging blew me away. A well made box that opens in a very cute way. The container looks like a tiny stick of butter and is magnetized so i do not have to worry about it opening in my purse.",1469318400,2016-07-24
5.0,"This is a thick moisturizing cream. Directions call for evening application.

So far, I've noticed more smoothness is my skin. not so much improvement in fine lines or firmness.

The hydration is something I can definitely feel, it's helped with my dryness and being in a dry household and outdoors facing cold winds, I surely know it's helped in the hydration department. The other claims, such as radiance, I personally have not experienced myself.

I think it's a good hydrating cream, when used on a steady basis can help with overall dryness.

Going on very dry skin, it does feel comforting, but as I haven't personally experienced improvements in other claims the company promises, I really cannot comment. Everyone has different concerns and issues of the skin. Because the cream has not affected my own problems doesn't mean it will produce better results in another skin type.",1489622400,2017-03-16

2.0,I have sensitive skin with occasional breakouts around my chin area so thought I'd give this a try. Only tried it once because it stung so bad and it sort of smells like bleach. Decided to give it to my son's girlfriend who has mild to moderate acne. She was only able to use it for a few days because she said that she had a stinging sensation from day one that intensified. She gave up after four days because her skin was so dry and burning that not even putting on lotions helped. (Even putting on sunscreen felt irritating). Based on both of our experiences I'd say use if you have normal to oily/very oily skin and expect some irritation.

That product evaporates quickly so you must work fast.  I could not get into the middle of the brush to get it clean, but the outside seemed cleaner but there was foundation residue left behind.

It has a strange scent that is hard to explain.  It is not bad smelling but it is does linger behind.

It probably works better on eyeshadow, blush or any kind of dry powder makeup instead of liquid even though it states all types of cosmetics.  I think I will to stick with my mild soap and water to get my brushes clean.",1458086400,2016-03-16
4.0,"The thing with any type of perfume is that whether it works for you or not is so dependent on your individual body chemistry and your personal olfactory aesthetics and sensitivity. Personally, I don't wear scent very often because I'm too sensitive to it and it gives me a headache when other people wear too much (or sometimes, depending on the scent and alcohol content, any at all).

I really liked this body tender milk from Burberry because it has a light scent that's neither too musky nor too floral. I can't really describe it too well except to say that I like it. It's feminine but not sickly sweet.

It sprays out of the (very generously sized) bottle as a lotion, so you have complete control over how much you and where you apply it. For me, one tiny little drop rubbed wrist-to-wrist goes a very long way. A drop is just enough for me to notice the scent but not be overwhelmed by it.

This is quite gentle.  It foams when you rub it against your face, and it does a good job of removing dirt and oil without drying out your skin.  It rinses off cleanly, as well.  So as a cleanser, it's quite good.

I also think this helped my skin heal after a recent breakout, probably faster than it would have otherwise, and I didn't get any new blemishes during the first week of using it (which is how long I've used it so far).  This is with once-daily use (I keep mine in the shower and use it at night -- it definitely seems to help removing stubborn oil-based makeup).

And now, the one thing I don't care for: the scent.  This smells acidic and almost vegetable-like.  I can't think of a better way to describe it.  It's an effective product, and it's not like you're using it for a long time, so I can put up with the scent.  But I don't enjoy the scent at all.

Here is the full ingredients list since I didn't see it on the product page:

Organic lemon juice, organic sweet cherry juice, organic white grape juice, organic aloe juice, decyl glucoside, vegetable glycerin, sodium hydroxide, gluconolactone, sclerotium gum, xanthan gum, lysolecithin, pullulan, sodium benzoate, sodium levulinate, organic sage leaf extract, dandelion leaf extract, lemon balm leaf extract, algae extract, tocopherol, retinyl palmitate, lime oil, tetrasodium glutamate diacetate, sodium anisate, citric acid, may chang, organic bitter orange and organic ylang ylang pure essential oils

1.0,thankfully I could return these -  I have hot rolled my hair for 20 + years - these are the worst rollers I have ever used - I bought them because of the size - I wanted some larger ones for a softer look with mostly body - the problem with them is that they  take a long time to heat up and they don't get hot enough to reach the outer layer of the hair and they also take forever to cool down which the cooling is what sets the curl . I have a set of Remington rollers which I love- they have clips that are heated as well that goes over the outer layer of the hair so that your whole head of hair is soft and shiny - unfortunately they don't have them in jumbo but I was able to go to their website and purchase an extra set of the large replacement  rollers so that I can use all large instead of medium/ large so if you are looking for a primary set of rollers I would suggest going with Remington hair setter or the curruso steam rollers which I also love,1417824000,2014-12-06

4.0,"I wasn't sure if this was a lotion or a body wash. Although it states neither, but as a ""cleansing gel"", i tested it in my hands. It felt gel-like and clear in color. I rubbed it on my hands, and there was little to no lather, and then it started to become sticky. Almost like a hand sanitizer. After rubbing into my hands a little more, it felt filmy where I ran my hands under water to get a better sense of it. So I decided, maybe its best as a shower gel.

Although marketed towards babies who have sensitive skin, it certainly can be used by anyone. Especially those who are sensitive to the stronger soaps. This gel is hypoallergenic, and as stated on the bottle, it has 0% soap and fragrance free. It goes on easy and does not lather.

4.0,"My wife was going to use this hand cream, but reading the label she got a funny look on her face and shoved it at me. ""I can't use this. It's says it's for men."" I was skeptical, but sure enough, reading the label--this is a men's hand cream.

Well, I dutifully used it on my masculine hands, to make them smooth and shiny. It seems to do the trick. My white color computer keyboard abused hands aren't exactly rough, but whatever my manly requirements are for hand smoothness this cream meets them. I'm no expert, and not a regular hand cream user. I don't know that is enough to convince me to start, but maybe ...

The only problem is that my wife won't touch it because of the ""men's label."" I don't honestly know what spins this more towards men than any other hand cream. It doesn't have a particularly masculine scent. I suppose it is just marketing, but in this case it has backfired a little.",1441670400,2015-09-08
4.0,"Let me join the chorus: this is a well-designed brush with an easy-to-grip handle and soft, pliable bristles that allow you to distribute product lightly or apply more pressure for serious blending. It is a large brush, not the largest I own but larger than it looks in the photo, with the bristle area about 2.5"" x 1.5"" so you will want to use it for applying blush and contouring. It will not work for your eyeshadow! The brush is attractive: you can see the Japanese aesthetic at work.

I have read reviews complaining that the bristles tended to fall out. I have not seen that problem, and I have tried tugging on the bristles. They're not going anywhere. I haven't tried cleaning the brush yet, but as delicate as the bristles feel, the construction seems sturdy.

The Japonesque website states that all their products are cruelty-free, but I spent some time searching for the exact materials used and could not find that information anywhere. (That question is even posed on their website FAQ...and not answered specifically!) Apparently the materials are animal ""byproducts"" but since the brush is made in China, you may indeed wonder about the provenance of the bristles. For that, I deduct a star and will not be likely to acquire more of these in the future. If that doesn't bother you, this is a great addition to your collection.",1458345600,2016-03-19

It can be used for any skin type and it helps younger people who suffer from acne to use this gentle scrub and remove oils and dirt form the skin before applying anti-acne creams or lotions.  Main ingredients are: water, glycerin, glycolic acid, lactic acid, cetearyl alcohol, emu oil, stearic acid, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol.

5.0,"I have fine thinning hair.  I used two other products before trying Toppik Hair Building Fibers. I used a color spray aerosol and a brush on powder.  I didn't care for the aerosol spray because you had to be so careful not to get overspray on your clothes.  The brush on powder does work for small areas, but my hair continued to thin and it was time consuming to cover the top of my scalp.  This powder was suggested by a sales clerk at a beauty supply store.  It seemed to work better and was easier to use.  If I had a choice, I would like not to use any product, but I don't want my scalp showing so I am very happy to have a product like this.
  I started purchasing from Amazon and found the product more reasonably priced.  Amazon also has a pump that screws onto the Toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most.  I use a little hair spray to help hold it in place.  I found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights.  I would be lost without this product.  One negative I don't think can be avoided, is the powder can make your hair look a little dull at the roots, but the alternative would be the appearance of  thinning hair.

5.0,"Toners are pretty standard across brands, featuring some amount of salicylic acid with inert or inactive ingredients like water and fragrances, and this is pretty much what you would expect: something that helps you shed your dermis at a faster rate, preventing clogs in the pores and buildup of dead skin and oils, as well as bacteria, the main causes of acne and breakouts. As with all toners, this one can make your skin a bit dry and photosensitive, so you sometimes have to use lotion, which can kind of bring you back to square one by irritating or clogging pores. (Basically, avoid comedogenic oils or lotions so you don't end up in a loop of over-drying, over-moisturizing, and then irritating skin.) Avoiding sun and using suntan lotion is also kind of a must if you are using this regularly.

That aside, and it applies to all toners, this works pretty well!",1456358400,2016-02-25

4.0,"I always stocked up on Micellar water products when I went to France - they've used it & loved it for years.  It was supposedly invented for Parisian women because the water in Paris is so ""hard"".  The water is hard there, I can vouch for that & that is why the pharmacy was always one of my first stops when arriving in Paris.  Hard water makes it difficult to remove your makeup & tends to dry out the skin.

This is good micellar water for oily skin.  It has a light scent, removes my makeup & does not irritate my skin.  I often use this to clean my skin on days I am not wearing makeup. I don't feel the need to rinse with water after using it but it does leave a light scent behind.  I do use this water on a cotton pad to remove makeup although it does not remove waterproof makeup as easily as the Garnier micellar with the blue cap.

This is not a toner or just a makeup remover so you use it a bit differently.  You soak a cotton pad with it & then place it over your eye or wherever & just hold in place for a few seconds  let it gently do the work for you.  You don't need to rub everything off.  You let it soak in & then gently move the cotton pad without rubbing.

This stuff is not magic, it is science & it has been around for a long time.  The micelle surfactant molecule is suspended in liquid/water and kind of grabs on to the dirt/oils/makeup on your face & doesn't allow it to stick on your face.  (That is my simple, non-scientist explanation.)  There is no irritation - even around eyes.  And the skin actually feels clean without rinsing with tap water.  When you use it, it seems like you are just using regular tap water except it actually dissolves/grabs the goo/makeup off your face.",1492473600,2017-04-18

Here's the thing: In order for a physical sunscreen to protect your skin, it needs to stay PUT. It can't slip 'n slide all over the place, and if you touch your face a lot, or layer a lot of makeup over this product, you can accidentally ""remove"" the physical veil that's shielding your face from the sun.

The shade is more of a yellow tint to cancel out any redness; don't be fooled into thinking you'll get coverage like a BB cream.

4.0,"I've been using this Juice Cleanser for about one month.  Different products work for different people - for me this Juice is a bit too drying on my skin for me to use it daily.  But on the other side of the coin I do use it a few times per week and it makes my skin look less oily.  All organic and smells all organic (kind of a seaweedy smell to me).  Goes on light and slick on the skin (not lathery) and washes off easily.  It does seem to help reduce blemishes for me.

Overall, I'll continue using this Juice Beauty occasionally for ""shine control"" in conjunction with another daily cleaner I use that doesn't dry out my skin as much (and also is much cheaper).  At $22 for 6.75 oz this Juice Cleanser is on the pricier side relative to some other options out there but if it suits you best then you can't put a price on that.

As for face... This or any one other product won't replace an aesthetician because a great aesthetician will vary her treatments. Mine deals with a variety of peels at different strengths, natural products, and once in a while we do microdermabrasion. Plus massaging for oxygen flow and firmness, and so on. I learn so much from her. She can see what's hormone versus diet, stress, rosacea, what to watch out for. I went from acne to clear over time with her.

Also it's just good to vary products. Weather changes, humidity, age, stress, diet and other factors keep us in our toes so I would say this product is good among others, based on what I need at that time.

Not criticizing the product, I did give it 5 stars, just not a save-all. I'd say incorporate it into the routine but vary your treatments and keep an open mind. This one is a little strong for daily. I'd say it's a good 1-2x week routine for the face.

5.0,"La Roche-Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel Cleanser is excellent. This clear foaming gel cleanser is for ""oily sensitive skin"" and is free of soap, alcohol, oil and parabens. This gel cleanser does have light fragrance, though it doesn't irritate my skin or aggravate my allergies. The Effaclar line of products are formulated for sensitive oily or acne prone skin. Still, I use Effaclar Clarifying Oil Free Towelettes and they agree perfectly with my sensitive skin even though it's dry instead of oily. I've been trying the gel cleanser even though my skin is sensitive but not oily, and my teen with sensitive oily skin and also moderate acne has also been using it. As it turns out, it actually works quite well for both of us despite our different skin types.

For my teen, this cleansing gel works especially well. It's definitely more gentle, yet seems more effective, than the orange oil free wash recommended by his dermatologist. That one overly dries out his skin but never seems to help minimize or get rid of his acne. Instead, after washing his face, his acne always looks more red and inflamed. Since using the Effaclar gel cleanser, his acne looks calmer and not as inflamed, he hasn't been breaking out and his skin feels is less dry and feels softer. This Effaclar gel cleanser (with Zinc PCA) seems to deep clean his skin without being so harsh. Only time will tell how well it helps his acne, but we're really pleased so far, and he's going to continue to use it daily instead of the other brand.

For me, although my sensitive skin tends to be dry, this gel cleanser still feels gentle and leaves my skin really clean and refreshed without being irritated or feeling tight or too dry. I normally use La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar brightening cleanser (or one of my other creamy cleansers), and as a matter of preference think a creamy anti aging cleanser is a better match for my skin type. Still, I'll use the Effaclar gel cleanser periodically to clarify my skin as it seems to get rid of residual impurities from my makeup, pollution, other skin care products, etc. I think this Effaclar gel cleanser is a winner, especially for those with sensitive oily skin.",1482364800,2016-12-22

2.  The consistency of the pomade.  It's a lot softer(maybe goopier)than other pomades I've used.  It feels more like a gel to me.  I'm not saying it's bad this way, just outside the norm of other brands.
3.  The scent:  It's nice.  Not over powering, but it's there.
4.  Ease of use:  Very good, It's a great pomade for someone just getting started using this type of product with short hair.
5.  The branding:  Very cool!

In short, I think the product is ok, but I wouldn't reccomend it to people with medium to long hair.  Also, the people using pomade on a regular basis might be disappointed in this pomade.

Not bad, but there are better ones out there.",1523145600,2018-04-08

4.0,"I'm a male 35 male with normal hair that has thinned a bit as I've aged, but I' not balding or anything. My hair isn't real thick anymore though. I got a sample of this conditioner (the older product Moisture Scentsation. I liked it so much I had to buy this 33 ounce big bottle of conditioner and shampoo! The conditioner is slightly less potent than the previous product it replaced Moisture Scentsation, but with all the  extra amount you get for the cheaper price, you can still get the same effect by using a bit more conditioner.

It smells super minty and makes your head tingle, love it. The best part is when you dry your hair it falls perfectly with no residue on it. Other conditioners made my hair feel and look weighed down like it was coated too heavily, but not this stuff. It is awesome and worth every penny!

I would have given this a 5 star review if it were just as good as potent as the conditioner it replaced, the abba Moisture Scentsation, but it is still great.

Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow dry!

One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you're not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.

5.0,"This makeup foundation really stays put.  It doesn't look heavy when applied. It seems almost too sheer to cover flaws unless you layer it. When you start to remove it though, it doesn't come off with just washing with water. You need a makeup remover.  ""Honey"" is probably for someone with a good tan or a little darker skin.  The ""Honey Beige"" works well for me. I usually wear ""beige""  and this works fine for me.

3.0,"First, there are many good things about this product. It is all natural and organic and free from chemicals, which I really appreciate.

However, there are a couple of concerns on my part. They call it a ""peel"" (maybe because the ingredients help to exfoliate the skin), however, I equate that word with a mask that actually peels off, versus a mask that rinses off the skin, as this one does. To me, the name of the product is misleading, and I believe ""mask"" would have been more accurate.

Second, it has a rather odd smell. It is not a strong smell, but it reminds me a bit of rotting fruit. I realize reactions to the scent of a product is personal, and others may not agree with me, but when I give a review I like to be as honest as possible. Perhaps they did not add any scent to the product to keep it pure and natural, but I still think it smelled a bit strange. (And this differs from their moisturizer, which does have a light, pleasant scent.)

The price is high, but it may be worth it to individuals who are interested in a natural and chemical free product. I like the mask enough to continue using it, but I do not see me spending money to purchase it for myself in the future.",1414800000,2014-11-01

3.0,"While this product may do good things for my skin, I'm not crazy about the way it cleanses.  The instructions are ""Dispense, mix with water, and gently massage in a circular motion.  Rinse.""  The problem for me is that it doesn't cleanse as well as I expected.  I've used it several times, and if I have foundation on my face, wiping my face with a Kleenex after cleansing shows there is still a trace of foundation on my face. Of course, I don't expect it to remove eye makeup, but I do expect it to remove all traces of foundation.

The cream/lotion is light and has a pleasant smell that seems familiar to me but that I cannot place.  It is not irritating to me, and would get a higher rating from me if it cleansed just a bit better.",1473897600,2016-09-15

5.0,"I have sensitive skin and used to believe that physical exfoliants, like natural sugar scrubs, were better for my skin type than peels.  Recently an esthetician told me that I should in fact be doing the opposite because physical exfoliants were irritating my skin and yet not removing enough dead skin for my pricy serums and oils to properly penetrate. Accordingly, I decided to try this instead and have been really, really happy.

As someone with sensitive skin I like that this delivers effectiveness with as little irritation as possible.  Using it as directed I had some light flushing afterwards, but nothing serious.  And of course the pinkness went down eventually.  But I'm especially excited with the results.  I find that my skin texture looks more even and feels smoother.  I also find this helps lessen my breakouts.  And exfoliating with this regularly seems to make the rest of my skincare routine work better.  I have an involved routine and shell out quite a bit for oils, serums and creams so I love that I'm finally seeing their full benefit.  Previously it seemed I was using the most hydrating facial products possible and still struggling with very apparent fine lines and feelings of tightness, but now my skin looks more dewy and well rested and my fine lines are less apparent.

In other words, this alone isn't a miracle product.  But if the rest of your routine is solid and meant for hydrating or anti-aging it can help ensure your products fully penetrate and aren't stopped by dead skin.

I'd recommend this.",1448668800,2015-11-28

She said while the line it draws is 'average' in width, she was able to smudge it afterward for the effect, without disturbing the original line. It worked beautifully. (Often that smudge meant to highlight, undoes the line you've worked so hard to draw perfectly.) She likes the design and, as a mother, I do too - it's a twist to release, which means the product discourages over-uses: keeping/using the product too long. Her eyes are sensitive due to her allergies and I know she's not as conscientious as she should be about replacing liners and mascaras as often as she should. No one likes it when their favorite eye cosmetic dries up, but sometimes it's the only way to be sure they remain fresh.",1412985600,2014-10-11

3.0,"Before I start, I'll point out that my hair is thick and difficult to manage.  Even if its cut short, gels don't tend to hold it all day.  I was looking for a solution that would help me tame the wyld beast.  Currently I use Schwarzkopf's Got2B Glued, essentially Elmer's Glue for the hair.

So a little about Baxters. The name is for Bxter Finley, who invested Super Shape in 1965 and, with that success, went into all kinds of products for men: toner, creams, soaps and shaving creams.

My first experience with this Pomade was not positive. It didn't turn my hair orange, or make it stick straight out.  Instead, it simply vanished.  I put it on, rubbed it in and that was it.  No hold that I could tell, no shine, just simple disappearance.  The second time, I used more and saw some shine (or thought I did).  The third time, I mixed it with my normal gel (Got2be...) and that did the trick.  I had the hold and the shine came out.  In short, it looked good.

Its possible that different hair types will have different reactions or results. Simply, your mileage may vary.

But for my own hair, I'll use this as a supplement to my regular hair regimen, finding that it doesn't do much for me on its own.",1375920000,2013-08-08
1.0,"This product is useless.  When I use the pad that comes with it, it takes off make up as I put the powder on.  Forget waiting 2 minutes.  Foundation leaves a permanent make-up stain on the pad even after washing which tells me it really is soaking up the foundation rather than buffing it. I tried this powder several different ways: with 3 (yes 3 different Dermablend foundations I also reviewed) another brand foundation, and on skin with no make up. It works best and looks best on a make up less face.  Next it works okay with another brand's foundation.  Not as much comes off and I'm here is a little bit of glow. Finally, it does nor work at all with Dermablend foundations. That's right. The pad takes off the most make-up and has no glow with the very make up with which it should be designed to work well.  I tried using a brush made for compact powders, and it was a little better across the board.  In no scenario did my make up last any longer or prevent any more shine than using loose or compact powder from another brand.  It makes no sense to buy this compact.",1504483200,2017-09-04
4.0,"I really do like this body scrub. There is no warming sensation they talk about in the description, but it is a luxurious scrub (if you don't mind a heavier menthol type scent). I like the scent because both I and my husband can use it as it's neither feminine or masculine (and everyone needs to exfoliate regardless of gender). It definitely leaves a clean, refreshed feeling to your skin without any gross residue. I have very sensitive skin and it didn't irritate me at all, which is another huge plus as it's hard for me to find exfoliating scrubs that don't irritate my skin. If you don't mind a scent that has heavy menthol to it and you want a unisex body scrub that works well I highly recommend this.",1531526400,2018-07-14
4.0,"I picked this cleansing oil up with the intention of using it myself but after one use turned it over to my young adult and teenaged daughters. The reason? I don't wear makeup at all except for the odd occasion and felt that this product was more suitable for those who do, plus I was concerned about the concentration of oil in the product for my skin type. Here are our thoughts:

Me - 52, don't wear makeup, normal skin, no real issues. The product seemed too oily to me, I worried it would cause break outs if I used it regularly. (I tried an EVO regime a couple of years ago and was broken out for months afterwards, so I am very worried about using oils on my skin.) The smell of the product was kind of antiseptic to me and I did not love that either. 2.5 Stars from me.

Young Adult Daughter - 22, prone to hormonal breakouts, wears standard powder face makeup (Bare Essentials type stuff) and eye liner, mascara, eye brow pencil. She initially used this cleanser to remove Halloween makeup. She said it worked but did not get off all of the eye makeup. (There was a lot of that!) She since has been using it to remove regular makeup and she thinks it works well and feels nice. She does not love the oily texture of the product. She has not mentioned the product odor. 3.5 stars from her.

Teenaged Daughter - 13, prone to the usual teenaged breakouts, wears light powder, eye liner, eyebrow pencil. She loves this product. Feels it works much better than what she had been using before. (Philosophy cleanser.) She is okay with the oiliness of the product but likened the smell to Lysol. 4.5 stars from her.

Recommended with above reservations - 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for purposes of review. (I will update and change rating after a months usage, if need be.)",1414972800,2014-11-03

3.0,"This is an ok eye product so far.

It is a fairly thick lotion, a bit too greasy for me to use on my top lids during the day under my eye makeup.  But I have oily lids--if yours are dry, you might find this more suitable.  It comes with detailed instructions on use, but these are written inside the box, which you must dismantle to read. Basically, you dispense some product onto the hard plastic applicator and massage all around your eyes. No! Do not do this.  You'll just be stretching the skin needlessly, and over time your eyes are going to look worse. Just dispense some onto a finger and gently pat on.

The product claims an ""instant"" wrinkle filling and eye brightening action.  No such things happened to me.

I am not sure who the intended market is for this product but I ended up with an unpleasant orange tone to my skin. Unless I followed this with a lot of foundation, I could never wear it to work or out. I might take it with me on a camping vacation where no one will really see me. Overall I did not like the thick consistency nor the color tone. It would be helpful for customers to get a sense of how deep the color is of this product....perhaps a color swatch?

This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.

Properly lubricate and use decent shaving cream and you'll be fine.  I would also suggest using the sharpest blades you can find, like Feather.

Looking back, I wish I had started with this and the Merkur adjustable razor.  This would have given me a good foundation of what is available and saved me a little money in the long-run.  These two razors do everything I need.

But this razor is solid and will last forever if taken care of and the slant is noticeably smoother than regular straight razor design.  I just wish Merkur made an adjustable slant - THAT would be the perfect razor.",1394496000,2014-03-11

My winter skin can look a bit flat and dull so I've been sweeping it on the apples of my cheeks, the bridge of my nose, and along the tops of my lips with a fluffy powder brush.  It gives the perfect amount of glow to my neutral-toned light/medium skin.  It's just enough to make my skin look healthy and awake, but not so much that it looks glittery or unnatural.

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

Once the citrus settles down there are some spicy carnation & woody notes & a hint of sandalwood & very light floral (jasmine).

This is a classic citrus fragrance that women & men can wear.  It is uplifting, just-out-of the-shower, clean & fresh.  There are no cloying notes & it smells ""natural"".  It doesn't have the usual men's citrus cologne notes of lavender & cedar.  I like this kind of fragrance on a hot/humid day.

For a citrus EDT, this has very good sillage & lasting power.  With one generous spritz, it goes to arm length & lasts about 5 hours on my skin becoming an up-close, clean herbal with light citrus.  It lasts even longer on clothing than on my skin.  Citrus fragrance is inherently short-lived on skin but this one is better than most.  Don't overspray thinking it will last longer - just plan to reapply later in the day if it fades too much.

A well-made classic citrus.",1458691200,2016-03-23

5.0,I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.,1467331200,2016-07-01
5.0,"Update:
After having this for a few weeks, my wife has mentioned several times how much she loves the scent.
-------------------------------
Smell is a subjective thing but my wife and I both enjoy this scent.  It's very mild and does not overpower..  The scent easily lasts for several hours if you spray it into the air and then walk through it or spray it on your wrists and then rub them together.

The packaging is very attractive and makes this a splendid gift for a loved one.  The bottle and lid are unique and substantial.  It definitely makes an impression and lets you know you've got something special.",1431216000,2015-05-10

She is a natural/buff beige, but during the summer months, she buys different shades of cover up to match her skin after she tans, she does not like the white face and brown chest look. Issue she ran into was colors on our computer screen did not match the colors received, probably due to our display, we checked out the same color on a few different screens, and the shades looked different on all 3. Over overall she said it provides great coverage, a little goes a long way, does not need to be caked on and leaves her face looking great.

5.0,"My wife tried this out and was blown away by the quality of a brand that had been completely unknown to her.

We received King's Canyon, which is a vibrant red color that my wife and I both like.

Her thoughts:
* It's 5-free - This is always nice to see, but somewhat hard to find
* Application is amazingly smooth and uniform, even though the applicator isn't as wide as OPI's.
* Additional strokes don't mess up the finish - touch-ups are easy to apply and look great

While we had never heard of Uslu Airlines before, now she can't wait to try more colors from this brand.

Be sure to press the small amount out of the small piece you twist off. I do find this makes my skin feel silky yet it has not changed the size or shape of my wrinkles. I have a couple smile lines and small crows feet and occasional forehead furrow if I get dehydrated. My skin had no reaction or break outs, redness or swelling.

The hair and body wash is very gentle against my daughters skin and hair, and a little bit goes a long way. You don't need a lot when using the bubble bath either.

4.0,"The first perfume I ever loved was Muguet des Bois, and the Lily of the Valley scent still makes me feel about 11 years old, in a good way, not the mean girl middle school way. This cream promotes itself as ""ultra-moisturizing hand therapy"" (also repeated in French on the reverse: ""soin hydratant intense pour les mains"" and of course it looks better in French.)  If ""ultra-moisturizing"" makes you wonder about greasiness, have no fear: it is non-greasy and quickly absorbed. After a few minutes, the scent has largely dissipated, leaving you with softened hands.

My hands are in pretty good shape already since I try to avoid using them, so I don't know if this cream would constitute therapy for cracked or dried hands. I also don't know how the scent compares to that of the other 16 hand creams in the Crabtree & Evelyn line, but I'm probably going to give some of them a try.

Travel sizes tend to be expensive, and for about twice as much money you can get four times the amount of product. That's not bad for a premium brand. The travel size is convenient -- my tube is setting next to my keyboard -- and the distinctive green color means that it's easy to find amidst all the other stuff that is sitting next to my keyboard. I may become addicted.",1455840000,2016-02-19

It was a little dark, which I can work with, but this has definite yellow undertones. This is a medium to full coverage powder foundation, I found that it did not cover my skin issues as well as my liquid drugstore foundation. If you have nice skin with nothing to cover, but just want a boost, this would be a good product for you. The finish is very soft and velvety.

Also, it does seem like my skin around my eyes (which tends to show age the most) is a little more smooth since I've starting using this product a few weeks ago.  I also use other skin care products and a regime, so I cannot say 100% it's a result of this product, or it isn't something my mind wants to see, so does.  I really like that there is a little pump that seems to dispense just the right amount.

5.0,"I have been really stepping up my facial routine because Im in my mid-40s. I have been using a 10% AHA acid exfoliator for a little while and I can already tell that my skin is looking better. My pores are tighter, cleaner and my skin looks smoother.

I have always heard great things about StriVectin Labs products, not just reviews but clinical studies have reported good things. I was very excited to try the StriVectin Labs glycolic peel. It interested me because it is 10% AHA acid which was recommended to me by a skin specialist but also claims that it is quick and gentle. I have pretty dry skin so although I want a thorough exfoliation to reveal better skin, I don't want something that is going to dry out or irritate my skin.

The StriVectin Labs glycolic peel comes as a 2-step process. You get 2 tubes of good sized product; each tube is 1.7-oz. According to research, products that comes in tubes or pumps are better for skin care because active ingredients start to break down and become less effective when exposed to air. Open jars can also allow bacteria in so the tube application is good.

Step 1 is a detoxifying primer. You apply on a clean face and allow to detoxify and prime your skin for 1 minute. Do not rinse. Immediately follow with step 2.

Step 2 is the AHA activator. You apply over the primer that you already applied from the first tube. You leave on for 3 to 5 minutes. Rinse off when time is up.

It was easy to do and I didn't find anything unpleasant. AHA can produce stinging, especially if you have any broken or irritated skin but nothing unpleasant.

Results: I have to say that I am very impressed. Although I have already been using a 10% AHA exfoliation, I think since this sits on the skin in a thicker mask that it really kicks up the exfoliation process. My pores pushed out things that I didn't even know were there. Ive had small places on my face that weren't quite blemishes but were small raised areas. Later in the day, these places had pushed out grease and dirt. That is saying a lot since my older, very dry skin doesn't seem to produce enough oil any longer to really keep my pores cleaned out on their own.

It says that you can use 1 - 2 times a week for best results. Im using twice a week and will continue to do so. My skin looks better than it has in awhile.",1428624000,2015-04-10

It's impossible for me to keep lipstick on my lips - wears off in minutes but I never knew why.  Even the ""16 hour long lasting lip stick"" didn't work - wore off in an hour or two.

I found out about this at a high-end salon that I was visiting to get my hair colored.  It works great!  It comes in lots of different flavors - I started with the Vanilla Bean and have loved it so I haven't tried the rest.  It's like brown sugar - really thick and creamy.  You just take a bit on your finger and rub it on your lips in a circular motion.  Then, wipe it off with a tissue.  I have found that there is still some residue so I usually wet my lips to get off the rest and wipe with a towel.  I only use it once a week now, and my lips are fabulous.  My lipstick last forever now.

5.0,"This is a an excellent, rich body lotion, even for very dry skin or rough areas like elbows and knees.

You only need a little bit and it hydrates the skin so well. It is a little thick, like a cream or body butter, but there is no residue left on the skin and no greasy feel. It makes your skin soft, smooth and moisturized. It is a little bit of a splurge to buy, but it is so worth it. Since you do not need to use a lot at a time, the bottle will last quite a while. The performance and quality make the cost totally reasonable. The scent is fresh and natural, possibly a tad spicy/natural. It does not linger though and will not interfere with cologne or aftershave scents.

There is a matching body wash for this, called Epic Moisture Clean Cream Body Wash. I just picked that up at Sephora. It is nice to use matching products.

We buy a lot of Jack Black products and they are all great. Since they are heavily concentrated, all of the products last a long time. The Hand Healer is excellent for very dry, rough, and cracked hands - especially if you have ""construction"" hands with calluses etc., from doing construction types of work. The Face Buff scrub is the best men's scrub we have come across and we have tried tons of them. My husband and son have both been hooked on the scrub for years now. We also buy the lip balm, glycolic cleanser, and Bump Fix for razor bumps and ingrown hairs.

This is a brand we have come to rely on over the years. High quality products that work very well",1413244800,2014-10-14
4.0,"This is a wonderfully lightweight hair dryer that works well and dries my hair quickly. The warm setting is plenty for my needs even with long, thick hair. The high setting does dry my hair even faster but is uncomfortably hot. My favorite thing about this dryer is how nice and light it is. It's so lightweight that it almost feels like a toy. Even with half an hour of continuous use drying the hair of several of the kids my hand didn't feel tired.

The reason I'm giving it four stars rather than five is because of the cool button and the cord. The cool button is very easy to press and once pressed it keeps the dryer on cool. The button is situated right where I want to grip the handle so I have to adopt a somewhat awkward grip in order to keep from pressing the button. The cord is the other reason. It's a heavyweight matte finish cord which is very long. I can see this being an advantage in a professional salon but at home the cord becomes combersome and makes this otherwise very lightweight dryer heavier than it needs to be since you're having to hold up several feet of cord while using it.",1484352000,2017-01-14

I did not like it as much as an under eye concealer because it isn't really that opaque when blended out over larger areas. In addition to not covering as well as I like and it also had a pale cast to it that called attention to the area. As an under eye concealer I would give it 2 stars.",1495324800,2017-05-21

I always say its looking better.)  Because it is still red and angry-looking, even months later, I was hoping that this would tone it down a little.  This scar was too much for Menajis abilities.  It would probably work better a year from now.

The other problem was the application.  It looks and feels a little like chap stick so if you are trying to put it on to cover blemishes, you are going to want to put it on your fingers first, because it is a little hard.  A little warmth helps.",1447113600,2015-11-10

She did not like them at all. It's rough and she has sensitive skin. So, I tried it (and I don't have sensitive skin) and my skin felt irritated too. I did not press hard and followed the directions.

I typically wear an Almay bronzer that I love, but was excited to try this butter bronzer for a more contoured, special look.

The shades are a little darker than my usual bronzer and give me a more glow-y look, which I love. I also really love the glow highlighting pen, though mine was a little ""crumbly"" and it seemed like some of it was being wasted. The compact is awesome with a really nice mirror- perfect to throw in your bag! If you're planning to wear this all day, you may need to reapply a bit since it's a powder, but I thought it still looked pretty good by the end of the day.

5.0,"Pomade is a hair styling product that gives a stronger, longer lasting hold than other traditional gels and sprays. Baxters of California is a well-known, trusted company known for quality pomade.

Because pomade can comes in different varieties and is kind of pricey, Baxters has offered a sampler set with their clay (firm hold/matte finish), cream (light hold/natural finish), hard water (firm hold/shine finish), and hard cream (firm hold/natural finish) varieties.

This gives users of Baxters pomade the chance to try a new type or mix and match various varieties for an ideal look without buying an entire container. Its also great to let new users choose which one to purchase. Also, the sizes are convenient for travel if you need to maximize space on a trip.

If you want to know more about using pomade in general you can visit visit Baxters how to videos here:[...]
The only downside is that you pay more per ounce for this set than buying the regular sized containers ($28.00 for about two ounces vs. $20.00 for two ounces).

I gave it 5 stars because its a cool gift idea, perfect to try out their different varieties, and good for travel. And, the pomade is high quality and works.

Also, if you know you want to use pomade often, spending a little more for this set will allow you to try out the varieties and pick the one you like. This will save you from wasting money in the long run. But, if price is your concern, you might want to read up on the different varieties (basic description above in this review) and then pick one based on your research.",1481673600,2016-12-14
4.0,"I have used Vichy in the past and have all been pretty good. I liked this as a moisturizer the best. You can use it as a mask as well but I feel like just the moisturizer is good and this way I get more use out of this. Overall, you don't need much to feel the difference. It isn't greasy or oily to put on.

I feel the effects don't last too long though, hence one star off. The next morning, my skin hasn't changed too much but I do feel a little bit of a difference. It is not drastic enough yet to notice a change. The other thing is I noticed that in the ingredients, they used blue 1 in this, probably to get that blue color but some of the ingredients I really did not think would be necessary.

The ingredients are: Aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, caprylic/capric triglyceride, squalane, ammonium polyacryldimethyltauramide/ ammonium polyacryloyldimethyltaurte, CI 42090/blue 1, CI 42053/green 3, dimethiconol, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, poloxamer 338, disodium edta, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, biosaccharide gum-1, xanthan gum, parfum/fragrance code FIL: B159170/2

5.0,"have used many Obagi products in the past but this is my first time to try this therapeutic moisturizer.  I chose this product because during harsh winter is the midwest I I live in Chicago), it is very important to keep skin moisturized and protected.  So let me explain why four starts for the product:  this 1.7 oz of product contains Glycerin 20% (skin protectant) as an active ingredient. Inactive ingredients include:  allantoin, corn starch modified and a wide variety of parabens.  That's right - it is when I see parabens on the ingredients list that I get turned off for a moment. I generally try to avoid parabens in any form whenever possible.

However, I must say I really like this product on my skin.  If I had to compare it with any other products available I would compare it with Neutrogena's hand cream.  This moisturizer is much lighter than mentioned hand cream but the feeling of incredibly soft skin is just the same.  I use it in the morning on the days when weather is icy cold outside or when it is snowing.  I layer it with skin protection SPF cream.  Product absorbs well and it is an excellent addition to my already existing collection of Obagi skin care line products.  This product is good for any skin type.",1486080000,2017-02-03

5.0,"Erno Laszlo Timeless Skin Serum, 1.7 fl. oz. This beauty aid, from the well-known firm of the late Dr. Erno Laszlo, claims to repair, restore and protect the skin's youthful vitality, while  also  slowing the skins further aging.  Its makers add that the user will see dramatic improvements in hydration, smoothness, elasticity, even tone, fine lines and wrinkles. That the product will rebuild cell integrity, strengthen skin structure with vitamin E, while marine extracts stop collagen destruction for a super-firming effect. That the  serum works to improve hydration, smoothness, elasticity, and tone, will help delay the appearance of aging.. That it will remove accumulated environmental damage, restore the  skin's youthful vitality while it minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The makers also claim that the beauty aid is phthalate-free, petrolatum-free, colorant-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, paraben-free. That it contains meadowfoam seed oil to attract exceptional amounts of moisture, boosting defense and shrinking signs of age; marine extracts to serve as powerful antioxidants to fend off free radicals, reduce skin irritation, and smooth  the surface of the skin. And  Vitamin E which is a vital antioxidant, healing specialist that fights off the effects of free radicals, restores the integrity of the skin. The makers suggest that it be used by gently applying with the fingertips, blending upwards and outwards from the middle of face, to the eye area, neck, dcollet.

Dr. Erno Laszlo was actually  born in Translvania, then part of Hungary.  And, as my beloved Dad used to say, as Hungary was a nation  of microclimates, talented people were quick to find natural products that would improve the taste of food or the users looks. Laszlow studied in Budapest, completed his clinical studies in Berlin, Germany, under Max Joseph. In 1927, Lszl opened his first institute in Budapest, the Ern Lszl Institute for Scientific Cosmetology. He quickly achieved fame when he created a special foundation cream for Princess Stphanie of Belgium, who had lost her self-confidence due to an acute case of acne, then treated the  facial scars of a locally famous actress who had been shot in the face by a man she rejected.

In 1939, at the onset of World War II, Lszl moved to New York: the New York Herald Tribune reported that the Ern Lszl Institute, specializing in beauty treatments and cosmetics, had leased a floor in a building on 677 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan.  The institute admitted beauty seekers only by recommendation; among its clients were the Duchess of Windsor, Doris Duke, Marjorie Merriweather Post, Greta Garbo, Lillian Gish, Grace Kelly, Ava Gardner, Cecil Beaton, Katharine Hepburn, Paulette Goddard, Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Of course, the world being what it is, Laszlos firm has since changed hands several times among larger corporations.

Well, like everyone else, I am no longer as young as I used to be, so,with this pricey products distinguished lineage in mind, I decided to try it when it was offered on Amazon Vine. It goes on  nicely, is quickly absorbed by the  skin, has a light pleasant fragrance. There was soon  visible improvement. Fine lines  crowsfeetaround the eyes are less visible. Freckles, as I prefer to call them, though you may admit to age spots, are visibly lightened. Elasticity is improved; skin has, in general,  a more youthful appearance.  If you can afford this serum, its quite effective, worth the money.",1514678400,2017-12-31

4.0,"I received this product free in exchange for my opinion and my opinion is mixed.  Let me start with the good.
1) This serum smells great
2) It is absorbed quickly into my skin
3) It left my skin noticeably smoother (To test this, I applied it to the back of my hands and asked my husband which felt smoother and he was able to pick the correct hand)
4) It comes in an easy to apply consistency that isn't drippy
5) It didn't cause any adverse reactions

On the negative side
1) I didn't notice a reduction in my fine lines
2) It is rather pricy

Here's the thing.  I really like how this serum makes my skin feel, and I find it to be very soothing.  Because it absorbs completely I am not left with a greasy feeling but instead just have much softer skin, and I appreciate that.

5.0,"I have been using Clarisonic products faithfully for many years. When I had the opportunity to try this collection of brush heads, I was delighted. As we all know, our skin condition can vary from day to day depending on weather, hydration level, sun exposure, exfoliation treatment, etc. This set provides the options we need to make the right choice for cleansing each day. Included in this set are four brush heads: Radiance, Deep Pore, Sensitive, and the exceptional Cashmere Cleanse.

Each brush head is well-made with the quality I have come to expect from Clarisonic. They vary by stiffness and density of the bristles for specific uses. The Cashmere Cleanse is the most luxurious of all, with a soft, delicate feel that makes even the most irritated skin feel soothed. As always, each brush is compatible with all types of Clarisonic handsets and fits easily in place with a satisfying click.

My only complaint, as this is with all Clarisonic brush heads, is that of storage after use. The cardboard box it comes in is not suitable for putting back a wet brush head. Some sort of plastic storage device would be very helpful, especially if you plan to use all the brush heads in active rotation.
In all, this set is a lovely way to try some of the newer brush heads, as well as bring more flexibility into your facial cleansing routine.",1506902400,2017-10-02
4.0,"Julep is an expensive brand that has its own subscription service and sells in Sephora. In the past I've been wary of it, feeling that it's all about packaging and marketing, while the product itself is very watery, with the end result being that you have to apply several coats just to see the polish, and thus use up the bottle in no time.

This sheer pink, however, is not too bad. Using just one coat, it leaves a touch of pink that has the glossy transparency of a French manicure. Perhaps because the liquid is thin (typical of Julep), it dries fairly quickly. Though the product is reputedly ""vegan"" friendly, the smell of the nail polish was still very strong and kept my cat away.

This gimmick with this one is that it has ingredients to help you strengthen your nails. Since regular nail polish already adds an additional layer of protection over your nails, I'm not seeing any difference as yet. So far its chief value is its appearance. Overall, it doesn't look too bad, but I still prefer Essie polish, for the price and the thicker feel of the polish that you get.",1469318400,2016-07-24
5.0,"I'm an African American male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth. It makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and I can't where the low to bald styles since I have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids. It's so embarrassing that I don't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator. One day I discovered Toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair I thought what the hell, it's worth a try.

Toppik has completely changed my life. It's not perfect but look at it like makeup. It covers up just enough so that if you didn't tell people they wouldn't know. I have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that I started using it and asked if they saw any difference. They said ""That stuff is F--- AMAZING!"" If you have thinning or balding hair, scalp issues to cover up it's worth the money.

It's not gonna stay on overnight. It's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat.

4.0,"My face poses what may be called a dermatologic challenge:  I'm on the wrong side of middle age, with a history of sun exposure (growing up in southern California at a time people didn't know the dangers of tanning), and the resultant skin cancers and sun damage have left me with wrinkles, scars, blotchiness, and uneven coloring.  So I was eager to try the em michelle phan Great Cover Up.  Here's what I like about it:

1.) It's not overly thick or annoying.  It goes on think, with a powdery feel.

2.) It does an excellent job of covering up a wide range of facial problems.  I have two large circular scars on my face that are quite white compared to my skin.  The phan product doesn't conceal them entirely, but it does a wonderful job of making them less obvious.  I know they're there, because I look for them, but a casual viewer wouldn't notice them.  The cover up works very well on all my other facial flaws... dark circles, uneven toning, etc.

3.)  While it's best to apply this in conjunction with foundation and/or other makeup, it works all right by itself in a pinch.  I'm a minimalist when it comes to makeup (most days wearing none at all), and I'm usually not in the mood to spend a lot of time putting on a dozen different products.  So if there are times I just want to tone down the scars or make the dark circles under my eyes less obvious, I can put on this concealer and not deal with the rest of the hassle.

The only downside that I discovered is that the concealing benefits don't last all that long.  If I put it on in the morning, the scars etc. are obvious by afternoon.  That's possibly a function of the humid southeastern summers I was testing this product out in. Bottom line:  If I'm going out later in the evening, I'd want to reapply this, or wait until shortly before leaving.",1411948800,2014-09-29

5.0,"I have VERY thin hair on the top and front of my head. I'm a 41 yr old female with female pattern baldness. I have medium brown  curly hair. Based on previous reviews I chose light brown. I'm happy I did me because it blended perfectly. To apply I found the spray applicator works best for me. I dry and style my hair and then gently lift sections up and holding the sprayer 3-6"" above my hair, give shallow ""poofs"" to the shaft and 2-3"" in length from my scalp. Then I lay the hair back in the desired style and generally mist the hair in the thinnest spots-patting the hair to gently push it into the hair itself. Then light spray with hairspray. I have also not used hair spray and it stayed in place as well. It has never come off on my pillow or my clothes. The only issue I have is getting too close to my scalp- it can become polka dots in my bald spots if not careful. If you have a small bald spot this would be fine, but my hair is so thin I would need a lot of product to cover my scalp. Toppik plumps the hair I have and dusts my scalp in color to minimize my scalp showing. My husband thinks it looks really natural- he didn't know what I had done but kept saying how good my hair looked. He was surprised when I told and showed him the product. He had no idea it was fibers! Part of what really makes my hair look thicker is that this product is great to make your hairline part look thinner and thus making your hair appear fuller. To keep a straight part line, lay a pipe cleaner on top of your part or use a piece of paper to cover the part line and then apply to Toppik over the paper/pipe cleaner. You will be amazed how minimizing your part maximizes the look of your hair! It's a good solution with little effort. Depending in your type of thinning/balding will determine if the product is successful for you. The product does attach to the hair you have and does appear thicker and it does not come off until you wash it. It did exactly what it promised to. Good luck!",1400198400,2014-05-16
5.0,"I can't believe I have never reviewed this. I recently pulled a several years old tub out of my stash to use in desperation from a recent break out and couldn't remember why I stopped using it. I'm going to address what I feel are the main complaints about it and my opinions.

Smell: it smells like sulfur which if you have never used it, can smell like rotten eggs or a book of matches. If you are used to sulfur, it shouldn't be a huge deal. I personally have a sensitive nose, my friends call me the hound, I can tell you what you ate for breakfast. I also suffer from headaches caused by scents. That being said, the smell doesn't bother me, and no one has ever complained about it to me, but it does last a while. Some people smell the ichthammol in this, which smells like car tires or something similar. That is the runny brown stuff that may separate and sit at the top which a few people have had issues with. (Mario says just stir it up). I've never seen it separating though personally.

The container: it's in a tub. Most people don't enjoy this aspect. I imagine it was chosen because the consistency of the product is so thick that it would be impossible to get all of it out of a tube. This definitely would not work with a pump. Tubs can be unsanitary, if you are not a good hand washer, or if you have long nails or fake nails, then you should use a toothpick, qtip or spatula to remove the product.

Consistency: dry. Super dry. I've had many samples of this (I picked one free sample up every time I bought the drying lotion which is hg for me) and eventually I bought an actual full size of it which has lasted me years. But even new, they were all extremely thick and dry. I don't have anything to compare them with except maybe clay. It's very hard to spread. But the product is called drying cream, so I'm not going to complain that it's dry. Some people have said this product is creamy, so ymmv but I've never seen it creamy. I've never had a problem with it wiping off while I'm sleeping. Eventually it gets drier and drier in the tub but it still works. If it's solidified, you can try to add a little water to bring it back to life (in your hand not in the jar because, germs). I've had my full size jar for years without it becoming solid but the samples seem to dry up after a few months, especially if you leave them open by accident like I did a few times lol.

Causes a rash?: not for me. some people maybe be sensitive to any one of the ingredients. A lot of people have sulfur allergies. Lemon can be very irritating and it usually is for me but not in this product. The other ingredients may cause a problem for you. Here are the ingredients:
Deionized Water (Aqua), Zinc Oxide, Aloe (Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice) Gel, Cetyl Alcohol, Lemon (Citrus Medica Limonum) Extract, Colloidal Sulfur, Ervol, Octyl Palmitate, Ichthammol, Polysorbate 80, Titanium Dioxide, Polyglycerylmethacrylate (and) Propylene Glycol.

Does it clog pores? Does it cause more acne?: I don't know. I can only tell you everyone's skin is different. I have oily skin and large pores all over my face. This product has never made anything worse for me. It has never clogged my pores or caused more acne.

Concealer really?: this can only be used as a concealer if you are extremely pale, which I can get away with if I don't have a tan. I am fair to light skinned. Medium in the summer.

Does it work: yes, for me it works. It works best on those bumps I tend to get on my forehead or temples which are usually from hair products or face wash or something that is clogging my pores or irritating me. Those bumps respond to nothing except time, or this. It also works for me when a product or food causes me to get what I call a whitehead rash. This is when you get a lot of teeny whiteheads that are in clusters usually between my eyebrows, and in the area where people get smile lines (don't know what the area is called). These whiteheads can sometimes be itchy, they are very easy to pop but they come back what seems like immediately and more pop up each day until my skins irritation/allergy reaction naturally stops which for me is about a week or more. I feel like popping them just makes them spread so if they are tiny enough I leave them alone. I get these usually from chemical sunscreens, products with irritating essential oils (ironically just like this product has haha), or when I eat food I'm allergic to.

How I use it: overnight as a spot treatment, it works best if you rub/work it in well, it needs to really have contact with the pimple from all angles. I have used it over larger areas with a thinner layer sometimes if I have a bunch of tiny pimples or bumps. This usually shows improvement overnight but may take a few nights. This product is best used consistently. I have personally seen it dissolve small whiteheads (pus filled pimples) completely with one or two applications, which is amazing to me. It can be drying, if you keep applying in the same spot day after day.

Would I buy again or recommend?: I have and will continue to do so.",1430870400,2015-05-06

5.0,"The straightener comes packaged in an attractive box along with two plastic vials of the Macadamia Conditioning Treatment which can be used with the straightener.  We have found the straightener to be easy to use and especially at the lowest settings, easy on hair when using distilled water.

The instructions that come with the straightener are easy to follow and straightforward.  The heat setting is adjusted using a plus and a minus button.  The temperature is indicated using a progressively larger bar located next to the buttons and can range from 300 F to 450 F in five steps of approximately 40 degrees each.

The ceramic blades are thinner than the width of the handle because room has been made for the mist feature.  The thin blades aren't a big deal in my opinion and I actually felt like I had better control maneuvering the straightener.

Either distilled water or the Macadamia Conditioning Treatment can be used for the cool mist.  The liquid is added to a small reservoir in the handle which is easy to remove from the straightener, but not at all easy to open.  I had to really dig my nails under the rubber stopper to get it to come out without tearing off the rubber tab which I presume was meant to be used to remove it.  I had to use a small funnel to add the distilled water because the opening to the reservoir is tiny.

Overall, we are pleased with the ease of using the straightener and that it results in straightened hair without heat damage.",1472342400,2016-08-28

2.0,"I am a big fan of the PCA line, it has been the only thing to work on my adult acne (mainly the A&c serum, BPO cleanser and nutrient toner). However, I have been using this product for over a month and I do not see any change on the lines under my eyes. I am so used to having fast results with their products that I expected to see some kind of change after the first month. What I can say about this product is that as small as it is I still have A LOT left,PCA products can be expensive but they do last a long time. I will write another review on my third or fourth month.

UPDATE I am a big fan of PCA skin products and I had to update this review because I really believe I was sold an expired toner and other PCA products. I stopped buying PCA products on amazon after comparing them to the ones I bought with my dermatologist or @skinstore.com. I noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products I bought on amazon where different and where able to come off. Sadly I can't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore.com or skinstore.com will not even give a small discount on PCA products (PCA products are always excluded from promotions).
The A&C serum I bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have  the newer (better quality) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump.

The cystic zit was gone within three days of using juice beauty, which is impressive.  The blackheads cleared up within a week.  The blemish on the chin, well that beast is just winding down, three weeks later.  To use juice beauty, wet face, apply cleanser, scrub, rinse.  My package came with a nice little washcloth, which aided in the scrubbing. After you pat your face dry you put some blemish serum on, it comes in a little tube, it's very runny, so squeeze with caution or you'll get a whole mitt full.  You can apply the serum to just blemishes or the whole face.  I went with the whole face approach, which I liked, because it has a little tightening effect after you put it on, it's great.  Wait a few moments before putting the moisturizing lotion on otherwise you have a white creamy mess on your face, when the serum isn't quite dry and you put the moisturizer on right away...you get a mess.  The face mask, was, nothing impressive.  It comes in a little jar, you scoop it out and put it on, wait ten minutes, then rinse off.  The mask never tightened, or made my face feel any different.  So the mask, didn't do a thing for me.  I really like the cleanser and the serum.

The case can be a bit of a puzzle to open, mainly because it has grooves that it can allow it to be snapped together with others of the same brand. It has a nice mirror, but no brush which would make it hard to carry with you in a purse. For the higher price tag that it has one might think it would contain at least a small brush for travel or carrying.

Just for full disclosure....Part of the promotion for this is that it has the properties of gingko biloba leaf extract and aloe vera to hydrate the skin while mattifying properties keep it from shining and also vitamins A and E to improve the skin of all types. However there are at least 10 ingredients listed before the gingko and aloe including petrolatum, which the Environmental Working Group, a U.S. non-profit organization that does environmental and safety studies, says has a ""moderate hazard"" safety rating, and that cosmetics that use petrolatum need more study for safety.",1399507200,2014-05-08

 First, I must address the odor issue. The face wash and acne clearing serum smelled absolutely rancid.  When we first opened the acne clearing serum tube, the content came squirting and losing out. The serum was very liquidy, like water with smelly brown grains.  It looked like  puddle water and smelled like pond scum.  I immediately checked the date on the box, but we weren't near expiration.  I don't think the serum should have had the consistency our tube had.

 My son decided to try it despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.

I was a little worried since I had never tried Laura Geller cosmetics before that my eyes might be irritated or an allergic reaction may occur because I have such sensitive skin. I can only wear like 2 or 3 different cosmetic brands other wise I look like I have chicken pox lol I honestly did not have any reactions skin or eye wise to this eyeliner and I was so happy about that. Then I read that this particular brand of eyeliner was ophthalmologist and dermatologist tested for sensitive skin and that made me fall in love so much more. I am happy to see cosmetic lines taking interest in the fact that most women have issues such as allergic reactions to particular ingredients in basic make ups. SO far this is my FAVORITE eye liner and my go to at the moment. I honestly am shopping for more of her cosmetics because it is so rare for me to find make up that I can enjoy. Oh another big plus to this eyeliner is that it is waterproof which means no runs or streaks if i feel a need for a cry or a swim.

3.0,"Even though the box for the actual product was mint and undamaged, when I opened the container, there was primer all over inside the lid and on the thick, spatula like applicator. So, a little was lost here. Then, trying to get it out of the container in a clean, sensible manner was not exactly easy. The delivery system here is so deeply flawed. (I really like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JAPONESQUE-Velvet-Touch-Primer/dp/B00JRUH6JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JAPONESQUE Velvet Touch Primer</a>. I have used it for a little over a year with spectacular results. And, the pump bottle means the product stays clean and the amount is very much controlled).

Now, I was concerned when I saw the white hue and the somewhat thick quality of the product. (And, it does smell distinctly like sunscreen). Nonetheless, if one really takes one's time and works this into the skin, it will disappear and provide a nice, smooth base for foundation. (I used this with Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Hydrating Gel Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 30 ... it ended up looking lovely).

Overall, I think my Japonesque primer is more effortless and provides a better effect. So, while I will be sticking with that, I do like the sunscreen element of this product. If the container were better, I think this would be a smashing success.",1470787200,2016-08-10
3.0,"I LOVE the color of Too Taboo but unlike most of the Essie nail polish colors I have tried so far this color started to chip rather quickly. I put on two coats as it does streak a little when applying the first coat, and also Essie's top coat. Within 2 days I noticed one nail was starting to chip and in 3 days another one. I can usually wear most Essie nail polish colors for at least 7 to 9 days with a base and top coat and I put my hands through a lot. The color pictured is not as pink. It is a deeper pinkish color, not quite a plum though. I would wear it for a special occasion but not for the week.

5.0,"I really like this fragrance, probably one of my favorites in the Juicy product line. I have 4 so far (Juicy Couture, Viva La Juicy, Viva La Juicy Noir and this new one, I Am Juicy Couture).  This new one smells a lot like the original Juicy Couture but with a heady bouquet of summer flowers and summer fruit (peaches,  I think).  While I liked the original, I like this one even more.  It just reminds me of Spring & Summer, outdoors in the warm fresh air when everything is blooming.  It's a much softer scent than Viva La Juicy, which seemed to have bright berry notes (reminded me of raspberries) and smelled a little sharper when first applied.

While I really like this perfume,  it may smell totally different on you.  I would suggest smelling a sample before taking the plunge.  After all, this isn't a cheap bottle of drugstore colonge.",1457481600,2016-03-09

5.0,"This product has changed my life... I feel so much confidence since I've had it. I was tired of people looking at the back of my balding head and the top. This adds hair fibers to existing hair. It covers everything on.my balding head. Sometimes it takes some time in the morning to do just like you have regular hair. You have to get a hang of the pepper shaker style. I have tried the other tools they offer, but as a primery bald person that just seems to not work as well. The pump just blows powder all over. Most people don't even notice there's a difference, and they think I just dyed my hair. I sleep with it at night and leave it on for almost about a week (5 days) then it starts to get a little itchy. Has to be touched up everyday. I.spray w hair spray n blow it w blower to hold. I have read that you can get it wet and when I go in the shower it doesn't seem to come out right away... but I haven't quite tested that theory out yet. Also cut it when trimming up like real hair.

3.0,"Before you buy, just know this: All the raves for Anthelios (which started in the mid-to-late 90's) originally were for the *European* version, which contains Mexoryl, a patented UVA blocker with proven track record in EU and Canada. Mexoryl is highly stable; it does not degrade after hours of sun exposure, rendering the ""reapplication"" part of sunscreen nearly moot. L'Oreal was the one to patent and develop Mexoryl, which is why it's only found in L'oreal brands outside of the US. In the late 90s and early 2000's everyone was buying Anthelios from European or Canadian sites. Coasting on this word-of-mouth success, the US version was soon launched--- but without the star ingredient which is so effective. Why?

The FDA did not approve Mexoryl as a sunscreen; Talk to anyone in cosmetic industry regulation and it's well-known that the USA is 10 years behind Europe and Asia on approving sunscreens. The list of US-approved sunscreen ingredients is very short and hasn't changed in decades; whereas in Europe and Asia the list is longer--- they get to use newer ingredients that are lighter, thinner, and more absorbent -- Another reason why EU/Asia sunscreens feel like invisible silk---and US ones tend to feel greasy/heavy.

This US version does NOT contain Mexoryl, instead it contains Avobenzone --also highly stable for many hours under the sun -- but this formula also contains Oxybenzone, a controversial ingredient (look it up). I'm not against chemical sunscreens, but I personally avoid Oxybenzone as much as I can. However, one great benefit is the milky-light texture, absorbent finish that feels weightless on skin. This is one reason why it's so popular.

If you don't care about chemical UV filters and just want an absorbent formula that works great on the face, this is a good option. But know that the Euro version is far superior, and if travelling outside the US, stock up --it's very affordable.",1436832000,2015-07-14

I thought the flat handle might feel strange compared to the long thin rounded brush handles I am used to, but it feels natural in my hand.  The bristles are soft and lush feeling.  The wide rectangular shape gives you a wide flat side for blending but you can also use one of the narrow ends for smaller areas you want to blend.

Good makeup brushes are not cheap, so the price of this (at least as of the date of this review) does not seem out of line for comparable brushes.

The only drawback, and it is minor, is that the size of the handle means I can't stick it in the jar where I keep my other makeup brushes because it is too short.",1458000000,2016-03-15

I do not like the applicator, the pump works inconsistently - sometimes I need to push on it several times, and then too much product comes out, but sometimes it works just fine. You can use the round tip to apply it around your eyes, but I like it better to use my finger.
In about 2-3 seconds after application, the area starts to feel heat, and it lasts for a few minutes, then it feels cold for a few more minutes. It is quite puzzling, but I kind of started to like it. It does not make eye area red and just feels warm and then cool.

4.0,"I would be extremely impressed by this if not for how sticky it remains even long after applying. I have a mast cell disorder so tend to get dermatitis and itchy skin from all types of things ranging from doing a bit of gardening to chemicals, sitting in the sun or even overly dry temperatures. In short - I itch a lot. Worse, I've spent a small fortune on skin products that often end up irritating even more due to harsh fragrance or some odd chemical. I have prescription heavy duty topical steroids but repeated use can actually make things worse so when possible, I attempt to go with something a bit less powerful. This has basically no fragrance added so gets high marks on that. It feels so so when it comes to soothing. I tested on dry skin - not really noticeable. I tested on itches - it was average. What really made this a no-go for me is the stickiness that remained even an hour later. I had to wash it off which defeats the purpose. Nice big bottle for a good price makes this worth a try but it doesn't dry well.",1524441600,2018-04-23

3.0,"There's no question that this smells good, but as a cologne enthusiast I don't think it's worth significant praise. To test just how 'unisex' it is, I conducted a mini experiment where I asked friends to smell a sample and try to determine if it was a 'male' or 'female'. The results were expectedly mixed, with some leaning towards male and some leaning towards female. No one was especially passionate about one side or the other and when they discovered it was a 'unisex' scent there wasn't much surprise. Personally, I think it is more feminine than masculine.

What leaves me underwhelmed is how un-signature this fragrance is. Call me cheesy, but I like to select unusual colognes and even mix together favorites. I also want a fragrance that conveys images of mystery and intrigue, or at least convey SOMETHING. It doesn't have to be ultra masculine, in fact I've even mixed in some of the less sweet perfumes before. I think this fragrance is just kinda bland. By aiming to be neither male or female, it ends up being nothing. Like a clothing store where too much perfume and cologne have been sampled and they mix together into a bland mix of nauseous.

It does make me a little nauseous, too. A small spray goes a LONG way and too much is not flattering. I find myself almost being scared to use it because I'm afraid it'll end up being too much.

OVERALL: Not bad smelling, but it is strong and it doesn't have a lot of personality. Use in moderation and you'll smell nice, but I doubt you'll get any complements. The one area where it might work best is in a business professional environment, where a musky cologne is too overbearing and a flirty perfume is too sensual. For that, a more neutral pleasantness could be appreciated - but remember it's STRONG and nothing is worse than strong fragrance in a close-quarter work environment.",1463184000,2016-05-14
4.0,See pictures attached. I thought that would be helpful to show the true color against skin.  It's a nice product. I didn't give it 5 starts b/c I found it to be a bit thick and I really wanted something thinner and less heavy.  That being said it does work and it was the color I expected.  I am going to try it again tomorrow with a better foundation under it. The packaging is nice though and it comes with a nice application tool under it.  It's definitely a warm tone and would be great for highlight your cheeks as well.,1497830400,2017-06-19
4.0,"I really like this liquid foundation. It goes on well, it feels nice on my face, it smooths evenly, I think it looks good.
I didn't break out after using it either, as is often the case with new makeup.

The only problem I had with this is figuring out what color Im supposed to get. I typically get the 2nd-to-lightest color in a foundation spectrum. This one, Sand, is a 3, but Im not sure if that is 3rd lightest or 3rd darkest. (Their 1 is ivory so maybe 3rd lightest? But then their 5 looks lighter than the sand but then the large color swatches all look the same to me)
The color of the container is MUCH lighter than the actual liquid, which is more like yeah, sand. However, it looks darker when it comes out, its a bit lighter than that when you actually put it on. It works for me, as long as I blend into my hairline and my neck well, but I would have been better off with a lighter shade.",1523923200,2018-04-17

I used it on my face, one hand and wrist. I was not only impressed by the color and coverage, but by how water resistant it was. I wore it on my face and had to wash it off with a little soap or makeup remover after about six hours. (I tried both. They both worked.) On my hand it lasted just a few hours, but I washed my hands several times and was impressed by how long it did.

There is no smell. It blends well but you can use a drop of water to help it too. It does not make your skin greasy, oily or dry. It has a very natural look and feel.

It just doesn't strike me as a fragrance for a young girl (which is who I planned to give it to). Much too heavy and bold for that in my opinion.

5.0,"People in the U.K. have made this the number one moisturizing cream in the country, and I can see why. I purchased a try me trio of products, and am so very pleased with all of them. The scent of all of the products I have tried is fresh and clean. If this scent was made into a day parfume it would sell out.

Marine Creams are all the rage, and this gel-to-cream formulation, helps to moisturize my skin.  Antiaging ingredients help improve the look of my skin while helping to reduce lines. I  never miss a day without a moisturizer and this one is light enough to apply under my makeup or to wear just by itself. This is Top of The Line and Top Quality. This is both light and non-greasy. The Pro-Collagen Marine Cream is formulated with marine algae, padina pavonica, porphyridium, and ginkgo biloba.

I use this every morning. I apply a pea-size amount into my hands, and gently smooth over my face and  neck. My face feels much smoother and softer. I have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles or lines. This product is expensive, but well worth the money. Only a very small amount is needed.

I made that mistake once wanting a deeper color tone and had a handful of hair fall out (but nothing too serious! don't let that deter you from buying this great product).

5.0,"I have an odd tone of skin due to my mix of Spanish (olive) and Irish/English mix. I am dirty blond/fair, but with a ton of pink/olive/yellow mixed in. Therefore, it's super hard to find makeup that works for me, and I have given up on cheap brands and just stuck with Lancome over the years for my foundations (which is also not a perfect match, I have to use a blend of two!)  As a corrector stick, this works pretty darn well. The color is obviously not as good as an actually color matched concealer, but that's one thing nice about concealer... it doesn't have to be exact because you put it under your final coat of makeup and blend it in.  This dark beige worked just fine on me. I think the lighter one would still be a tad better, but I just ordered it so we will see.

Quality and use is PERFECT.  The stick worked just fine for me, you just take the lid off and twist the base to make it come out. The thickness was PERFECT, and others complaining about the brush are just goofy... it's IDEAL for laying in the concealer in the corner of my eye and under; and I use my fingertips to brush it out and blend it in. It's really perfect. Usually just one dose of it is about right for highlighting the area around my eye and getting rid of dark circles. And I have a TON of dark circles right now due to a new baby with health issues, so I know it works!!

The makeup is awesome, nice, thick and creamy and applies wonderfully. It is ""wet"" but does not shine at all, very matte without looking cakey. Especially after being set with a touch up of my powder foundation with a kabuki brush, it's just gorgeous.  I usually follow this routine: Lancome's La Base primer (it's amazing!), Lancome's liquid Teint foundation, then I use a highlighter for cheeks, this concealer around the eye corner, and touch up with Lancome's dual finish powder foundation and blush.  I know it's expensive, so I don't always take the time to do the concealer and highlighter as well, but it does make a noticeable difference for when you aren't just going shopping or something.  I generally stick to a ""no makeup"" makeup and this works pretty darn well for that.",1489104000,2017-03-10

3.0,"I personally felt like the scent was a little bit overwhelming. It definitely has a highly floral fragrance which was a bit stronger than what I usually apply to my face. The Cream itself was very rich, but it didn't clog my pores at all. A little definitely goes a long way. I probably preferred it a bit more when it was rubbed on my neck than on my face.

I usually have very dry skin in the winter months, and this did a good job of hydrating it without making my skin feel greasy. If not for the strong scent, I would probably have given this cream 4-5 stars.",1427673600,2015-03-30
5.0,"Holy moisture!  Living in Colorado's dry climate, I find that I really need moisture - especially in the winter.  This StriVectin SD Advanced Intensive Concentrate is just that MOISTURE!  Major moisture!  I've been using this cream for well over 2 weeks and have been pleasantly surprised with the results.  Skin feels softer, dryness has been greatly depreciated and the overall tone of my skin has evened out.  Price tag is hefty but once I started using this, I haven't purchased the 2 bottles of cream I was using (day/night) prior.  So overall this is a must for dry skin (can't speak to someone with more oily skin)!",1406160000,2014-07-24
4.0,"I'm 31 and still get the annoying random zit every couple of weeks. I think it's more common than people think, getting acne well past your teenage years. That doesn't mean it's not a pain to deal with, especially when most products don't really work. So far, I really like this blemish mask. There's no horrid smell, and it's not thick and goopy. I leave it on for 15 minutes and it dries well, but with no problems getting it off. Afterwards my skin feels really refreshed and super clean. I'm not honestly sure in the long run if this will help clear the issues on my face, but using the mask once a week is a good idea regardless. This is a very pricey product however so I would just purchase one to test it out. I don't have severe acne so I'm not sure if it's more beneficial for people that do or quite the opposite but I also love that it doesn't make my already oily skin feel more greasy. If I notice further positive changes down the line I'll be sure to note them here.",1415836800,2014-11-13

It is a little refreshing, but I think I can probably get the same thing from spraying water on my face. I forgot to double check the price, but unless the long term is beneficial and very beneficial, i can't see myself purchasing this on the regular.

4.0,"I didn't love the scent, but it is nice and pleasant. The lotion feels thick and creamy as it goes on, and did a good job of keeping my legs moisturized all day despite the dry weather. The product is a good size - not tiny like a lot of lotion containers seem to be getting these days.

Also excellent was that when I ran the first half of the ingredient list through EWG's Skin Deep, everything came out either yellow or green - nothing toxic, nasty or highly allergenic. Yay! I'm pleased with this product and would buy again.",1445472000,2015-10-22

5.0,"Wow. Just wow. I have never had grooming tools of such quality, I will not ever be able to go back for my CVS 99 cent nail clipper ever, ever again.

Tweezers -- thought they would be tricky to use because they are so pointy, but the exact opposite is true, you can get that one stray eyebrow hair plucked with laser like precision. And these things grip on harder than the jaws of life. 5 stars.

Scissors -- razor sharp.have a nice grip, feel, and size and they open smoothly. 5 stars

Nail clippers -- the smallest, sleekest clippers ever. For some reason they don't seem that sturdy and I wonder how they will be long term. 4 stars.

Cuticle pusher & Nail cleaner -- most cuticle pusers are square, but the one is not and the rounded edge contours perfectly to the corners of each nail. The sharp edge is great to rid all cuticles away quickly. The cleaner end is nice because it is not as sharp as they usually are, which makes it easier to clean well without getting poked. This tool is sort of medium weight giving it a good feel and because the middle part is flat and wide, you get a good grip when using this tool. 5 stars

Nail file -- I usually hate, hate, detest nail files. It's like nails on a chalkboard and torture for me so I never use them. Ever. Was not expecting to use this one at all, but it is great. It has a rough and smooth side which leaves the tips of your nails so smooth like they have just been buffed. 4 stars (just because it is a nail file and no nail file will ever get 5 stars in my book ;) )",1433721600,2015-06-08

1.0,"I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.

I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.",1391472000,2014-02-04
5.0,"Saw this color featured in several magazines, and was happy to see it available here. The color is a vibrant glazed deep pinky purple that goes with so many fall and winter colors. Stunning with grays, jewel tones, and a real pop with black. I like Essie because it stays on nicely without chipping. Essie always has the perfect updated colors. This color will look great with whatever you wear this winter (The Lace is On).
  Also bought another 2013 color, Vested Interest. This is a lovely matte color, a greenish gray, that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors. Love the slightly edgy vibe, but super wearable, and looks fabulous on short nails.",1378080000,2013-09-02

I love the thickness of this cover creme, it will definitely do the the trick to cover up blemishes or under eye circles.  If you don't like thick heavy concealer, this is not for you.  If you need a highly pigmented, heavy concealer, I recommend you try this one.  I am very happy with it, but I might need to try another shade.  Follow instructions that come with it for application.",1497830400,2017-06-19

5.0,"Hey, the price is better than alternatives I've seen both on Amazon and elsewhere. Let's hope it stays that way and let's stay on top of that.

This active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, works for me. It's not the only thing I do to try to fight back against acne that flares up when I'm in humid environments. But it's maybe the most reliable treatment that I found and it's a good part of a more comprehensive treatment plan.

Yeah, I know, this active ingredient ruins clothes. I've ruined clothes and even a nice office chair. So I put it on only for bed where I will do the least damage and then shower it off upon rising.

I've been using it for five nights, and I notice that my skin feels softer and more supple.  I haven't noticed a difference in the mirror yet, but that may be because I've only used it five nights.  It's a 24 hour cream, so you only have to put it on at night and it keeps your skin moisturized until you put it on again the next night.  I do expect to see a difference in my face and neck if I keep using it, which I will do.  I'm very happy with this, because my skin feels so much softer and well hydrated.",1433721600,2015-06-08

Of note, you'll want to wear it on days you won't be rubbing your face since it does tend to wear off fairly easily and then need to be reapplied.  I've used Clinique, Lancome, and other expensive foundations and I feel this is on par, though of a much lighter weight.  I wear this for evenings when I am out but not for every day use, especially when I might be outdoors and sweating. But it is very comfortable and gives a nice even color.",1490486400,2017-03-26

The tint was perfect for me and the makeup looked so good.  It wasn't messy or difficult to put on.  It wore well throughout the day and since it's summer, oil from my skin didn't break through and look greasy.  I didn't need any more powder than the amount I put on in the morning after I apply foundation.  Great makeup l definitely buy again.",1503878400,2017-08-28
5.0,"I'm a long time Lancme Dual Finish user and have used it in matte bisque II for years. I've tried liquid foundation here and there and don't care for it at all. I like to even out my skin tone but I like to look like I'm not really wearing makeup. I guess I've been stuck in a foundation rut, but I didn't realize it until I tried Japonesque. The texture literally feels soft like suede or velvet and like it's barely wet. I tested shade 05, and looking at it I thought it might be too dark but not at all. In fact, it made me realize my Lancome shade is too light and makes me look washed out. I'm used to applying the Lancome with a damp sponge and didn't have the foundation brush recommended for the Japonesque. But anxious to try it, I washed my face, used my Dr. Weil serum and Lancome face cream, eye cream and eye concealer. My jar of Japonesque didn't come with a spatula (if it did I didn't notice it) so I dabbed some on each cheek with my fingertips and used my regular sponge to work it into an even application over my whole face, including over my eye concealer. The results are awesome! Natural yet more radiant than what I've been using and my skin feels so soft and slightly moist but not greasy. This product doesn't accentuate age lines like some foundations can do, like the dry bare mineral ones. It left no streaks or obvious foundation appearance. I later bought the recommended Stippling brush, and it works great applying Japonesque, leaving an airbrushed but natural look. This product is made in Italy, luxurious and the same price range as Lancme. A jar has lasted me quite a long time while trading off with my Lancme dual finish (which usually lasts a month or so). So happy I tried this product and definitely recommend it.",1415577600,2014-11-10

4.0,"This is a spray toner, not a lotion.  It is fabulous at reducing pores if you use it with a cotton pad rather than just spraying it on your skin.  For too long, I was just spraying it on my skin and yes, it had some effect, however, when I started using a pad, I saw a huge difference in the reduction in the size of my pores.  I am a fan of Pevonia products as they are nontoxic; I use many of their products.  Who knows why they call this a lotion; maybe because it also helps soften our skin?  I also wish they would have left it in a clear bottle so we can tell when we are running low.  I mentioned this to Pevonia to no avail.",1523750400,2018-04-15

After several hours, I get a little oily in the T zone but this lotion doesn't make the oiliness more pronounced.  All in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase.  I only wish it came in a bigger tube.

5.0,"I am a beauty product addict. Price doesnt matter to me, Ill try anything, and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion. My fave hair serum is $5. My fave face cream is $200. I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end lines.

That said, I tend to have frizzy hair on the top layer. But as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning, and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays (if Im lucky), I always struggle with this. I also don't want to use a flat iron every day, because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair color.

I stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner somehow searching for products with a more natural lean, although I know some people have issues with some ingredients here. My hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this, and a little bit of my fave hair serum, and its almost perfect (its only ever ""perfect"" when I flat iron!).

5.0,"I use this every day, but I also shower at night and ""no-poo"" my baby fine hair every few days. If you do not, then the fibers might get on your pillowcase.

With a new bottle, I peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker, then tape off 1/2 of the opening with blue painter's tape - otherwise too much will come out too fast.

You do not actually shake this on to your hair, but instead into your  part lines. Part your hair, hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so, and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there. You may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue. If you have a lot of fibers on your forehead, you are tapping too much and too hard - or you didn't seal off 50% of the shaker with painter's tape. It does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller, just a tap-tap-tap and them move on to the next area.

This would not work well for extensive baldness (nothing does!), but works well for the dreaded ""wide part"" problem. Dark hair would be more of a challenge on a light-skinned person, as the contrast between hair and scalp would make the fibers show more than with medium brown hair.

They have a really small travel-size that I carry in my handbag, so you can try it without spending much $...you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one!

One suggestion for Toppik company is to make the darn container transparent - it is completely opaque, so there is no way to know when you are running out, except to shake it in the sink. Dumb, as people would order sooner, if they knew they were running low.",1415232000,2014-11-06

5.0,"Vichy is a French company, subsidiary of LOral, which has been in business for about 80 years. I still haven't found out why the box is printed in something that looks like Russian. You might want to zoom in on the thumbnail pictures on the product page because the printing on the box is TINY. The ingredients are:

AQUA / WATER  GLYCERIN  PRUNUS ARMENIACA KERNEL OIL / APRICOT KERNEL OIL  ALCOHOL DENAT.  DIMETHICONE  HYDROXYPROPYL TETRAHYDROPYRANTRIOL  PROPANEDIOL PROPYLENE GLYCOL  ISONONYL ISONONANOATE  ZEA MAYS STARCH / CORN STARCH  HYDROXYETHYLPIPERAZINE ETHANE SULFONIC ACID  AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/STEARETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER  AMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE  C13-14 ISOPARAFFIN CAFFEINE  CAPRYLYL GLYCOL  CI 42090 / BLUE 1 CITRIC ACID  DEXTRIN  DIMETHICONOL  DISODIUM EDTA EPERUA FALCATA BARK EXTRACT  LAURETH-7  METHYLDIHYDROJASMONATE  PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE  PERLITE  PHENOXYETHANOL  POLOXAMER 338  POLYACRYLAMIDE SILICA  SILICA SILYLATE  SODIUM ACRYLATES CROSSPOLYMER-2  SODIUM HYALURONATE  PARFUM / FRAGRANCE.

The cream/gel has a very light feel. I know everyones perception of fragrance is different but it smells very fresh and clean to me and the scent dissipates quickly.  I didn't find it sticky at all.  The box says at bedtime: and at awakening: which would make one think it should be used twice a day. I don't wear a foundation, so I really don't know for sure, but it seems to me it wouldnt work well under make-up. I need a moisturizer with sun-screen.

The big question: does it work? It seems to, for me. My skin is firmer and smoother and wrinkles have softened. Is it worth the cost?  I guess thats a personal choice. I haven't found anything (cheaper or more expensive) that works better so it would be worth it for me.",1458345600,2016-03-19

There's just one gripe, for the price the burn just doesn't last long enough. Soy based candles are supposed to carry a longer burn but for the price ... you'd expect more than 100 hours. But the trade off is a wonderful scent that isn't overpowering but is noticeable, it's not going to fade into the background.

Baxter is an excellent line. I got my husband to give it a go and he likes quite a few products from their line. The packaging is wonderful, and would make a great gift for any guy, or girl, in your life.",1388880000,2014-01-05

4.0,"I could take or leave this toothpaste. I have it in both whitening mint and jasmine mint. I find whitening mint to be a little strong at first, but effective for removing light staining on teeth. Jasmine mint is very nice and light, also somewhat feminine. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is one simple fact: my breath smells horrible within an hour or so of using. My husband even told me my breath was bad (he's not one to typically say such things). Not my usual Colgate Total. I may buy the Jasmine again (I just love the taste) and get a tube of Colgate for when I know I will be around somebody.",1317945600,2011-10-07

5.0,"I'm a big fan of Tizo sunscreens. I have a severe sensitivity to the sun and the chemical sunscreens won't do it for me; I need zinc. The Tizos have all worked very well for me. I particularly rely on this tinted one for my face. Note that the tint isn't nearly dense enough to serve as some kind of foundation makeup; that's not its purpose. I think the tint is just to avoid that ghoulish white undertone you sometimes get with zinc sunscreens, and this succeeds very well at avoiding that. I put it on first and then go ahead and put whatever makeup or coverup I'm using right over it. Works great; I haven't broken out or burned yet!",1526860800,2018-05-21
2.0,"It's hard to give an objective review when I've only been able to use this about five times before the tip wore down rendering it unusable as I need very thin, soft strokes which a stub cannot give.

There was no sharpener in the package I received. I tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked (they only wore down the tip). The lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements (texture, color, look when applied, price/value ratio) that are a part of evaluating this pencil's effectiveness.

I've used a wide variety of eyebrow pencils over the years at a variety of price points. The best are easy to apply in that they don't seem to cake or clump and go on evenly (with a well-sharpened tip) and don't smudge; you can shape the tip as needed to give thicker or thinner lines. The consistency (a bit waxy but not too much), which you can't try before you buy, is a key factor in both application and longevity, once applied.

Other than the color itself, there's nothing that I liked about this product. Which is disappointing as this is a good brand and I've used other Longo products and been satisfied with their performance. It's especially disappointing given the price point.

Application: Not as easy as other pencils, which is due, in part, I think, to the consistency (waxy, clumpy) and the size of the tip (too small and chubby and not thin enough to my liking).

Texture: Not as smooth as other pencils I've used. Took longer to apply and had to keep smudging and fiddling with Q-tips to get a neat line. Didn't go on ""evenly.""

Look when applied: Seemed heavier and line was not as strong and consistent. Getting a thin line was very difficult (again, an issue of consistency and size/shape of product tip)

Color: This was a really good color for me, even though I have medium brown hair. I have found that many products labeled ""blonde"" are the right shade either alone or when used to lighten up a darker color.

Price/Value: Simply not there for me. I've had better application, better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper. But since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me. I have thin-ish brows and need thin, really feathery lines, which this could not deliver.",1395273600,2014-03-20
5.0,"I wear sunscreen all the time regardless of the season or time of day.  This sunscreen is one of the more favored by me in comparison to other Obagi Sunscreen products (and there are two more from the same brand but different skincare line).  First good point is the strength of the SPF.  This product is SPF 50 which is quite high.  The other advantage is that this product comes in tint.  When I apply this sunscreen on top of the moisturizer it provides both protection and coverage.  There is no need to use foundation because this sunscreen is tinted.  I have a very pale skin and a little bit of tint gives my face a nice color especially during winter time.  It totally replaces foundation because the tint can cover any skin imperfection.

Bottle comes in a very generous size.  It is convenient to be kept in the bathroom or taken to the beach.  I personally find it too bulky to be carried in a purse.  Great product, I highly recommend it.",1487376000,2017-02-18
5.0,"This is a really nice moisturizer. I find it difficult to find moisturizers that are good with oily skin. More often than not they're thin, and smell of rubbing alcohol, and this product is neither. It's a nice consistency (a light cream, not a thin lotion). It spreads over the skin easily, and it doesn't leave a greasy heavy feeling on my skin. It absorbs quickly too. I think this is a great product at a very reasonable price (a little goes a long way!). It's less expensive than the ""high end"" moisturizers, but every bit as good.

The hair clipper even has an attached brush in the base.  While Zwilling J. A. Henckels is a German company, this item is made in China, Korea and India.  Is it worth the current $99 price?

5.0,"Really loving this multi-purposethermal spring water spray.  first of all I like the size of the bottle...it will definitely last me longer than most aqua sprays, appreciate the simple design and the easy squeeze pump spray. It comes out in a gentle mist. *pic enclosed*

I know you can use it as a toner but right now I'm using it to set my makeup. I feel like it really brings out the pigmentation in my highlighter for that extra glow without any irritation. *pic enclosed*

This item can also be used as a great hydrotherapy cool down mist for your face in the summertime and I will probably buy another bottle to use it as such then. This provides a cooling sensation that I need. I didn't realize how great water therapy was until I actually felt that burning sensation from the suns rays and I needed a gentle cool down to refresh the skin on my face.

4.0,"I really like this serum. It's incredibly light and a little goes a long way (2-3 drops for my face). It feels like nothing and soaks into clean skin immediately, but actually feels hydrating when used alone, which surprised me, though I do like to use additional face cream at night for extra moisture (but it seems fine on its own by day). This is the first serum I've tried that was hydrating enough to use alone. But it is quite light, so I suspect in winter, my dry skin would require an additional cream around the clock.

Does it make me look younger? I don't know. Any moisturizer immediately plumps your skin and makes you look younger as long as you continue to use it--and this does a good job of that.

But I hate hate hate the bottle. It's dreadful. It's got a long wand affixed inside the lid with a rubber button, so it works sort of like an eyedropper, but really, more like a soda straw with your finger on the end. Yes, it dispenses one drop at a time, but meanwhile the whole side of the wand (which is long, like the bottle) is thickly coated in serum, so if you bump the neck of the bottle going in or out, you get drops of expensive serum running down the outside of the neck and either getting wasted and making a big mess or getting contaminated when you rub it off with your hands. It's an awful design for such an expensive product. It should be a pump or some other clean, mess-free, portion-controlled application.",1460592000,2016-04-14
3.0,"This is definitely scented.  I am not sure but it seems like a cross of floral perfume, powder, and sour milk.  Really strange.

The lotion is thick and feels more like a body cream. I am not sure that it is the lotion, but I started sneezing after applying this on my hands and arms.  I did not have a skin reaction though, so I don't know for sure what caused my sneezing.  It will probably end up being used by a less sensitive member of my family.

4.0,"I have used many oil based cleansers from DHC to L'Occitane to Coconut Oil.  This ranks right up there with the L'Occitane. I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.

It's a little off putting appearance wise.  While not in use, there is a clear line of demarcation.  You shake it for a few seconds and use a cotton pad to apply and then rinse.  I like that it is so moisturizing but manages to wipe off completely with no residue.  It is paraben free and has many botanical ingredients like Argan oil and truffle extract.  It completely removed all my make up including the waterproof mascara.  There is no smell that I can detect.

It's good for sensitive skin and is only very lightly scented, so if you're scent sensitive as well it should be fine.

Have not tried it as a mask but look forward to using it underneath a Japanese rice paper mask for ten minutes.

This is non-oily, creates a glow (I notice a difference), and contains great ingredients such as safflower seed oil, rice bran oil and shea butter.

It does not say, ""I need more of that"" to me, which I believe would be the reason for wearing it for most people.  It is in it's name, right?

My one ounce bottle came sealed in cellophane and appears to be authentic.  I have not purchased it before so can't compare to that experience.

5.0,"Wow! The Stem Cellular Instant Eye Lift maybe one of the best facial skincare products I have ever used around the eye area. I have tried many of the middle to upper end, quality, skincare products over the last ten years so while initially I was very skeptical of this two step system, I have been extremely impressed with the results.

The Juice Beauty description and claims for Eye Lift system are right on and I'm not sure I can improve on their claims that it, ""revives, brightens and lifts eyes with this revolutionary system to dramatically transform eyes' appearance in 10 minutes"".

It's not as complicated as I thought it could be when I saw it was a 'two-step process', quite the opposite actually. The Instant Eye Lift product uses a serum, Stem Cellular Activator Fluid and a surprising clever and effective ""pure marine algae Eye Mask"" to increase the ""level of potency"" and I would add 'effectiveness' of this eye lift and skin rejuvenator. It really is so simple, peel open the foil covered packet to uncover the mini masks, open a single-use bottle of serum and slowly pour it over the two silky, cotton-like masks. And magic happens! Or so it seems - but this serum/activator really does transform the eye mask product into this glorious gel-like substance that is easy lifted out of the container and placed under the eyes. There are two in each tray, one for each eye. I leave it on for 10-15 minutes and because it feels so effective and glorious, I can't bring myself to throw it away after I remove it from under my eyes. I slide one mask up onto my frown lines and the other over my top lip and let it sit for another 10 minutes. Another reason this product gets five stars, because I don't have to stop what I am doing and lay down with these treatments. These ""algae bio-matrix masks"" literally seeps into and clings to the face without the slightest sense of compromise as I go about my daily routine at home.

I can feel the antioxidants and nutrients from the algae masks absorb and revive my eye area as I work on the computer, fix coffee or get dressed. And it genuinely reduces fine lines, wrinkles and puffiness, and my eyes feel, and look brightener and refreshed. Fantastic product. The only negative about it, is the price - so just use one a week for 6 weeks and for about $12 a week, this is a better investment than many other skincare products that cost much more and are not as effective as Juice Beauty's Cellular Eye Treatment. Great product with great results. (This review was written by my wife)",1415232000,2014-11-06

The second week I used a cheaper Sally Hansen product that in the past only lasts about 2-4 days and I got 8 days of use before my ends started to tear and chip.

I have used two more times and each week I am so impressed.

I can feel a slight tingling feeling of the Vitamin C when I first put this serum on my face, which they advise you can occur on the instruction label. I find the tingling feels pleasant and refreshing (goes away quickly), and lets me know there is an active ingredient working.

5.0,"I use two other Obagi products besides this one.  I use the Foaming Gel and the Toner.

First I use the foaming gel to clean and then the toner to tighten skin and pores.  My pores have gotten more visible over the last couple of years and this combo helps reduce them.  This product, the Clear, comes in a Rx version and this non-Rx version.  It's a brightening cream formulated with Arbutin (derived from bearberry (uva-ursi) plant) and anti-oxidants to enhance skin tone.

The bottom line for me:  using this trip results in a visible transformation to clear and healthy looking skin.  Yes, these products are pricey.  But they do work and I believe the science behind them are sound.

If you are unsure, try the Nu-Derm starter set and choose your skin type:  normal/dry or normal/oily.  I use the normal/oily combination.

One surprise for me was how tiny the bottle ended up being.  Yes, it is 2 oz which is as advertised.

Overall - this is a premium product line and I believe it works if used as recommended.  There are other luxury lines that produce similar results - Perricone, L'Occitane, etc.  I tried this line and it works good for me.",1489017600,2017-03-09

5.0,"I've been using a prescription-strength Retin-A cream for about eight years, and generally have pretty good skin.  At the age of 42, though, I've been plagued by acne outbreaks that have been leaving deep red marks on my face that don't easily fade.  After doing some research, I had heard that Glycolic Acid peels can help fade acne scars, so I ordered this one based on the positive reviews -- and it really is fantastic!

I waited to use this for two weeks before writing a review, but even in that short amount of time, it has already made a huge difference in my skin, which appears brighter and feels smoother.  I've also noticed a pretty dramatic difference in my fine lines and wrinkles, especially around the eye area.  My red acne marks are also slowly fading, and I'm not getting as many breakouts as I had been.

I've been alternating this with my Retin-A cream at night, and use one pad on my face, neck, chest, and the back of my hands.

My sensitive skin tingles a bit after using this, but it's not too bad and the tingling goes away after a few minutes.

The other products that may also be helping are the Vitamin C serum and antioxidant serum from Paula's Choice that I've also been using.  I've been using the Paula's Choice products for about three months, though, and it was really adding in this Glycolix product that kicked things up a bit.

4.0,"While I'm fortunate to have pretty good skin, there's no denying that age is catching up to me.  So I was happy to try this cream.  I've used it every day for a while and my impressions have been extremely positive.

I think the scent is quite pleasant and although it's definitely noticeable, I don't find it particularly aggressive at all.  The cream itself is thick, rich and luxurious and keeps my skin hydrated all day long.  At the same time, it absorbs well, leaving no greasy residue.  Although Natura Bisse Diamond Extreme may be worn under makeup, I also sometimes like to wear it alone for a more natural effect.  If you spend time outside, you might consider adding a sun protection product to your regimen as that is conspicuously absent from the ingredient list.

Although it is expensive, the upside of the formula is that a little goes a long way and not much is needed to reap the benefits of this cream.  It's too soon for a definitive assessment but the trend is looking good and I'm anticpating continued use.",1525737600,2018-05-08

The one big negative and reason for not giving this another star is because of the pump bottle.  This has to be one of the worst pump handled bottles made.  It would only dispense a small amount and it is not fun to have to keep going back for more gel.  For the price and pump bottle, I can only give this a moderate recommendation.

1.0,"I read reviews on this product before purchasing it at Costco and many people have nice things to say about it.  However, one review I read was from a dermatologist, who just made the comment that creams that work on stretch marks and wrinkles are different.  Anti Wrinkle creams need to relax the skin and stretch mark creams need to tighten the skin, so it's believable that it would do one, but not both.

That said, I decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  To start, it's a nice smelling moisturizer.  But the first week, it caused me to break out (I have sensitive skin).  Still, I persisted.  The breakouts eventually went away, but I used it for about two months and saw no noticeable difference in my fine lines on my face.  I have returned to my old standby moisturizers and my face feels much better for it.

I have not used it on stretch marks, but since I have quite a bit left, that it what it is relegated to now.  If I notice a difference in stretch marks, I will update my review, but for now it is not worth the cost.  You can get much better for less.",1395619200,2014-03-24

Don't be intimidated by the ""Intense"" part of the description. You only need a little bit to untangle and smooth your hair. It doesn't weight the hair down or make it limp. At least it doesn't do it to mine.

3.0,"I have one huge, huge warning for you: if your skin is especially sensitive then you may want to exercise extreme caution with this mask. My skin isn't overwhelmingly sensitive, but it is sensitive enough to where my face did burn and get a little red after I removed the mask so I don't think that this will be something I do on a weekly basis. I would chalk this up to the glycolic acid, I suppose. My skin's just a little weird in how it reacts to new cosmetics. I do want to note that it did get better after patting the skin down a little and applying a little lotion.

However does it work?

Well, I can't really give you a complete answer for this because this is the sort of thing that would be best judged over a long period of time and I'm not honestly sure if I'll do this on a regular enough basis to where I'd see overwhelming differences for my skin. I'm someone who has always had problem pores and that's why I selected this from Amazon Vine, so that was the first thing I looked for when I took the mask off. It may be me hoping that my pores were smaller, but they didn't look as big as they did beforehand. I didn't see an overwhelmingly huge difference, but that may be something I'd see over time. My skin did feel a little softer afterwards as well. I can't honestly give any huge description on its anti-aging claims since I'm right on the cusp of starting to show my age, so I don't have any overwhelmingly visible age lines yet. They're there, but small- I can mostly thank my father's genes for that, though.

So is this worth it ? It looks like it does a pretty good job. The price for this would be a little daunting for me if I were to buy it with my own money, but I do have to say that a little bit goes a very, very long way. For my first mask I was able to pretty much just use the mask clay that was on the top of the jar lid. My only big gripe so far (other than the slight irritation for my skin) was how messy this can be when it comes to removing it. I definitely recommend using the old washcloths for this one, since it does leave somewhat of a stain on the cloth even if you constantly rinse it out.

I really want to give this a higher rating, but I just can't get past the burning irritated feeling that this left on my skin. I'm just not sure that this is really right for people with sensitive skin like mine. I'll try to get my mother to use it as her skin is delicate but not as finicky as mine is and try to report back on what she says. I think I'd like this better if it came with a slightly smaller dose of glycolic acid in it.",1416528000,2014-11-21

5.0,"This is a fantastic cleansing cream for dry skin. You only need a tiny (very tiny) amount to make a good lather that will cover your neck and face. When I rinse this off, my face is clean, radiant and soft. I am thrilled with that alone as my skin is very dry.

There's not too much fragrance in the product, which is a big bonus. Since one really needs to rinse thoroughly, whatever fragrance there is is gone after washing. I use a thick washcloth to help remove the product. The only downside (not enough to take away a star from this review) is that it rather feels like using shampoo on one's face. I'm not crazy about that, but I love the results so much that I don't mind.

Because I'm a member of the Vine program, I have to review this earlier than I would care to. Whether or not it lightens my age spots remains to be seen. If it does, I'll amend this review, but I can't add any stars! Honestly, I've tried so many products meant to cleanse dry clean and none of them do such a good job as this one.

Update: believe it or not, it took me over a year to use up this product! In the meantime, it's name changed. It did not do anything to lighten my age spots, but it is a great facial cleanser, and I am about to make my third purchase.",1450137600,2015-12-15

4.0,"My 15 yo daughter has a porcelain peaches and cream complexion and so far has been blessed with less acne than I had as a girl.  When this kit arrived the breakout she had was on her forehead.  They were tiny red spots.

She started using the kit and liked it.  She reported and I saw no signs of irritation.

SUMMARY
As you know when it comes to acne products, results will vary.

My teen used this product on a fairly large breakout of small red spots on her forehead.  They were not the large or even medium size zits that most people think of when someone says, acne.  I mention this because it could be that this product works better on some 'styles' of acne than others.

On the plus side nothing in this system irritated her pale, delicate skin.  The system stopped the breakout and seems to have kept any more zits from appearing.

On the downside, the system didn't zap the zits.  It may have accelerated their decline but they didn't vanish over a period of 3 or 4 days.

A big problem for teens is that 3 steps is a lot.  In fact my daughter would only use this once a day.  Twice was just too much.

Conclusion: I'd say there are good results but not miraculous ones for us.  It might have to do with the type of breakouts she has.  I won't buy more for her because of the time factor and I don't want to have to ride herd on whether she keeps up with this or not.  Other teens have better stick-to-it-iveness so it would be better for them.",1447891200,2015-11-19

5.0,"My boyfriend prefers to be a pretty low fuss guy when it comes to his hair, but also has thick wavy hair that can become unruly without product and some attention to styling.  For context his hair is longer and wavy on top and shorter on the sides.  This works for him.  He uses about a dime-sized amount and runs it through his hair when it's damp.  It helps keep hair in place and have a more polished look without looking overly shiny or stiff.  I personally like that we both agree on the scent.  A lot of men's styling products smell WAY too musky and strong to me.  This is instead a really pleasant, gender-neutral scent.  Mostly to me it smells like bourbon or vanilla, but without being cloyingly sweet.  I also think the packaging on this is really nice.  It's hard to tell from the picture but the look of it is very premium and substantial and consistent with its price tag.  Would recommend.",1473206400,2016-09-07
5.0,"My husband has a thick beard with very sensitive skin. He and I prefer a clean, shaven looks so he needs to shave nearly every day. For years, he has been relying on regular shaving gel without the desired results. He was anxious to try the L'Occitane CADE Shaving Cream.

The cream comes out like a paste but once you lather in your hands you realize how far it goes. It's as smooth as glass. It's very smooth and didn't leave his skin itchy or feeling uncomfortable. No nicks. No cuts. It delivered the closest shave he's ever had and his skin has been rash free. He will never use anything else. Though the cost is higher than shaving gel, a little goes a long way.",1419897600,2014-12-30

5.0,"With an aging baby boomer population, products like this are flooding the market.

And speaking as a baby boomer, I'm thrilled with this pillowcase!
It isn't any more expensive then a high-end pillowcase from Frette or Sferra, and it has the look of a bed throw pillow, and we all know those can be well over a hundred dollars if adorned with embellishments.

Add in that it feels fabulous on the skin, and the fact that it is 'rejuvenating' is just icing on the cake.
But does it work to help skin look it's best?
In my opinion, yes, I believe it has made a difference in the month that it's been my sleep companion. A subtle difference, to be sure, but considering all of the above, that's just fine with me.",1471132800,2016-08-14

4.0,"Pros: Shade #2 should work with most fair to light skin tones. Creamy texture spreads evenly and blends well over foundation. Nice translucent glow.
Cons: Will highlight bags, so be careful over uneven or puffy areas. Not an opaque concealer.

An eyelighter is intended to brighten the under eye area. It is generally worn over foundation and even concealer if necessary.

This product does a good job of highlighting. It is creamy, applies evenly, blends well, and dries fairly quickly. It contains a moderate amount of pigment and is more translucent than opaque. Once applied and blended into the rest of the makeup with a dry or damp sponge, it gives an attractive brightness or glow to the under eye area, the bridge of the nose, the cheekbones, or any other area it is applied.

A similar product is Touche clat - Radiant Touch by Yves Saint Laurent. A cult favorite around for years, it comes in 10 shades, and is far more expensive than this highlighting pen by Japonesque. The texture of Touche clat is more refined, more delicate and it is more pigmented. And there are more shades to choose from. If you are new to this type of product, Japonesque is a good place to start.

There is a fascinating but somewhat mysterious video attached to this product page. In the video, a pretty young woman demonstrates how to apply a full Kardashian Kabuki face of makeup. Although she applies a seeming truckload of a variety of brands of products to her face, she never applies this Pixelated Color Eyelighter. If she does, Ive missed it. She does mention two makeup brushes by Japonesque, but that seems to be it. Ive watched the video twice, mesmerized both times as she rattles off the products shes using.",1466121600,2016-06-17

3.0,"Ok, First off there is nothing , I mean NOTHING, that will give you immediate results in smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles aside from dermal fillers, so that alone is a bogus claim. This ""serum"" is more of a cream and is not too thick, but not as light as I would prefer. It goes on smooth and soft and leaves a very soft, velvety feel to the skin. It is almost a matte finish. It isn't greasy at all and absorbs quickly, leaving the skin feeling light. It did make my skin feel hydrated and I definitely prefer it over regular moisturizing creams that feel too heavy for my skin. If you have combination or oily skin and want something to keep your skin soft and supple without a heavy feeling, this is a good choice, but don't expect your wrinkles to instantly vanish.",1526515200,2018-05-17

5.0,"This is a great lightweight dryer that has the perfect amount of heat for my thick, coarse hair.  It dries so much faster than my old dryer, it's almost unbelievable.  It only takes me about 15 minutes to get the perfect blowout.  The ions really help eliminate the frizz, even in my somewhat wavy, frizz prone hair.  It's also super quiet and I really notice the difference.  I dry my hair most of the way using high heat and then finish with the medium setting.  The concentrator nozzle works great and helps me get very smooth locks.  I really appreciate the fact that this dryer is so much lighter than my old one.  My arm doesn't get fatigued at all when I use it.  This is my first Bio Ionic dryer and so far I'm really pleased with it.  It has all the features that I want coupled with the light weight and the fact that it's so quiet, which makes it a pleasure to use.  In the past, I've only purchased cheap dryers and have truly never been happy with their performance.  All of them were heavy and extremely noisy so this Bio Ionic dryer is a welcome change.  The old dryers never really controlled the frizz and my hair always felt really dry and damaged because it would take forever for my hair to dry.  This Bio Ionic dryer will save a lot of wear and tear on my hair because it dries it so fast.  It takes me less than half the time it used to.  I've had this dryer for about 2 months and am really pleased with my purchase.  It's definitely been worth every penny.  My hair is smooth with tons of volume and it now takes me almost no time at all to dry it, even though it's pretty thick and heavy.  I definitely recommend this dryer for anyone with my hair type.",1451347200,2015-12-29
5.0,"Like many people with thyroid/hormonal issues, I have skin discolorations.  I have what I affectionately refer to a Lizard Spot on my neck.  It's about the size of the palm of my hand.  When the spot becomes inflamed, I use make-up to cover it.  This is why I chose to try Dermablend Professional Cover Creme.

PROS
1) Following the company's instructions, Dermablend Professional Cover Creme took only *one* application to completely cover the discoloration on my neck! It took very little make-up to do the job, too.
2) Makeup feels light going on and doesn't feel thick or greasy once applied.  (It feels like a good-quality sunscreen, actually.)
3) Provides 30 SPF.
4) I used it with a transparent mineral powder, and Dermablend Professional Cover Creme stayed *fixed* all day.
5) Because it's lightweight, it will work well on most skin types.
6) It *does* cover discoloration and some types of scarring. It even masked a keloid scar I have on my cheek and made my skin appear smooth.
7) Comes with tiny application spatula.
8) Is easily removed with cleansing cream and water.

CON
1) Dermablend is expensive.

Dermablend is excellent quality make-up.  It's designed to Cover: and it does just that.  Even though I've embraced my Lizard Spot, it's *wonderful* to apply a tiny bit of Cover Creme and have it disappear.  Many women view make-up as armor against a working world that judges any and every imperfection. I consider Dermablend an extension of my confidence. On those days when my discoloration in inflamed, Dermablend *is* a moral booster.  I've taken to calling it Confidence in a Jar.",1499040000,2017-07-03

3.0,"In my opinion this is a temporary fix and does not help in long term repair.  The small tube has a metal tip with an opening that allows you to apply the serum when you squeeze the tube.  However since the serum is has a watery consistency, too much tends to come out and I am always trying to squeeze it back into the tube.

The serum is light and dries quickly leaving behind a pearled sheen.  It seems to fill in those fine lines underneath my eyes and make the skin more taunt.  It works great for use during my daily makeup routine every morning, but once I wash my face the ""illusion"" is gone.",1476316800,2016-10-13

I have struggled with finding an enzyme or exfoliating treatment that doesn't leave me just raw with red skin. This is a very gentle enzyme cream mask, it doesn't have much of an odor, and it is so easy to use in the shower (jump in, let the steam work for a minute, put it on, let it sit for a couple minutes, rinse it off). This and the Pevonia C Complexe are the two skin care items I splurge on. I have tried philosophy, Kate Sommerville, Murad, Dermalogica, Burt's Bees - multiple higher end skin care lines and many from the drug store as well and this has worked the best for me and my sensitive skin.

3.0,"I liked the idea behind this palette but the reality just wasn't impressive.  First, while the colors in each group were pretty enough, the pigmentation on many of the colors was poor.  Also, I found many of the shadows were difficult to blend.  On the positive side, creasing was minimal and the color (what did come through)  did last over the course of the day.  So the quality of these was really similar to what you would find at the lower end of the drug store selection.  Also, The design of these also seems poorly thought out.  While this kit came with a handy small magnetic compact that you could load one color grouping into so that you could take it with you during the day, there was no place in the compact to add a brush!  Also, there were labels to affix to the compact to identify the color grouping  but they weren't reusable stickers so they would only be good for one use.  And the sizes of the shadows didn't make sense.  Colors that you would use more of, like base coats and highlighters were small sizes, while colors used for eye lining were larger.  Unless you are going for the Avril L. look, chances are you won't be using that much shadow to line your eyes.  I think this concept had a lot of promise but for the price of this set, the delivery just isn't there.",1418256000,2014-12-11
5.0,"Yes, it is expensive, and no, it doesn't give you huge voluminous lashes. But I wasn't looking for a mascara that would give me big lashes, I was looking for a mascara that didn't smear all over and didn't crumble into my eyes/get stuck on my contact lenses. I have tried numerous brands - Clinique, Revlon, loreal, Pacifica, Paula's Choice. All have either melted/smeared or crumbled by the end of the day. I do have really oily lids, which is part of the problem. Once Blinc dries, it stays put. It doesn't crumble. It doesn't smear. It doesn't flake off into my lenses causing me to run out of meetings so I can wash chunks of mascara out of my eyes. Sure, it isn't an amazing mascara in terms of producing volume or length, bit it does help darken and define. I won't use anything else now. The only downside is if you get any water on the mascara before it dries, it bleeds out and creates a massive mess. Make sure your lashes are super dry when you apply.",1442534400,2015-09-18

3.0,"I ordered the Silk 'n Blue Acne Solution Device with my fourteen-year-old granddaughter in mind. She is sufferng, like so many young teens, from periodic outbreaks of acne. She and I sat down and opened the box. Inside were the acne device, a cord, a charging device, and a small booklet of instructions in English and a couple of other languages. Both she and I read the instructions. Just inside the front cover is a page of Quick Start Instructions which we both read. The first thing they said to do was plug the charger into the wall and place the device on the charger for 6 to 8 hours. I wouldn't call that a quick start. But we followed the instructions and then went out shopping and had lunch. After we ate, we found a couple of cute summer outfits. That worked to my grand-daughter's advantage. When we got back, she went in and washed her face with plain old soap and water. There was plenty of time for her skin to dry. The charging time was still not up. She and I waited some more. The lesson here is don't expect to be able to use this thing as soon as you open the package. Plan ahead.  We didn't.

The 6-hour wait was over and we pressed the on/off switch. A green light flickered to life and finally stayed on. Ready for action. My granddaughter's blemishes were concentrated on her forehead and chin, so those were the areas she concentrated on with the Blue. The LED light was on and she held the Blue against the skin on her forehead for a little over 3 minutes. She found the head of the device was getting pretty warm. She moved the head of the Blue to another place on her forehead every 3 to 4 minutes. She thought the heat was getting pretty warm. She applied the Blue to about 8 areas on her  forehead and 3 areas on her chin. It took about 40 minutes to get around to all the areas that had blemishes. She was through for the evening. The Blue was returned to the charger so it would be ready the next morning. After the Blue had been on the charger for another 6 hours, I removed it as I had read in the comments not to leave it on after it was fully charged.

The directions said to use the Blue twice a day for 6- to 8-weeks to start and to repeat the treatments twice a week for maintenance. The maintenance schedule seems reasonable but getting there seems to be a real hike to me. Lucky for my granddaughter, it's summer vacation but to keep up that starting schedule during the rest of the year would be difficult.

She managed pretty well through almost 4 weeks of treatments but she was definitely flagging in her enthusiasm. The treatments, lasting at least an half-hour each, twice a day, were taking up an awful lot of time, time she would have preferred doing other things. Fortunately, she was showing some fairly decent results with her skin. Maintenance arrived just in time, or I think she may have given up.

Her skin has been fairly clear now for a couple of weeks and she has been doing the maintenance schedule. I hope she can keep up once school starts again. We discussed the ratings for this device and she felt the amount to time necessary, especially at the beginning, was a real problem. She liked the results aside from the rare new blemish. I thought the time spent charging and getting the Blue off the charger so it didn't overcharge was a pain. All in all, we decided that 3 stars were just about right. The results were pretty good but it took an awful lot of effort to get there.",1438732800,2015-08-05

It definitely reminds one of organic and healthy...although I can't really vouch yet for any stem cell repair: I don't have any hugely visible difference yet after a few days. It seemed to cause kind of a mild acne outbreak though, which seemed to indicate that it was making my sensitive, normal-dry skin (with oily spots) to clear and begin repairs: this I actually liked because I can see where it's likely trending to improvements.

5.0,"It  is a great moisturizer for the face. I just received this cream this morning. It goes on easy and spreads a lot. My face feel well moisturized after about a half hour. I looked up niacin cream and found that there are studies by dermatologists that show that cream with niacin or Vitamin B3 in it is great for moisturizing, that is better than Vaseline. Also that after eight weeks use, it does reduce wrinkles. I am 71 years old and have good genes so I do not have many wrinkles, but I will use if for 8 weeks and see if there is an improvement. In the studies, they found that it  may be a good product to use to help prevent skin cancer but more studies are needed to verify this. I do have a lot of precancer spots that I have had frozen off so I am hoping that this can be proven.

The product spreads easily and smells fresh, green, not floral.  It feels luxurious, smooth, creamy and it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.

My husband tried it on his face and though it took him a while to adjust to not having the lather of shaving foam, he liked the way that it felt both while he shaved and after.  I found it pampering when used on the legs.  It's more of splurge item, but a treat to use.",1418601600,2014-12-15

One thing she mentioned is that the color is not orange which is a definite plus.  (She tried another self-tanning lotion that turned her skin a bright orange and she couldn't scrub it off fast enough.  So I guess that self-tanning lotion was really an exfoliant.)  Also, the color works very quickly to develop so you have to add it slowly.

She also likes that it doesn't streak if you are careful to apply it very evenly and it dries fairly quickly.  She didn't use mitts or gloves; she recommends just washing your hands really thoroughly after you apply it.

Another positive is that it's barely scented so it doesn't clash with her perfume.

So either Amazon must have had a bad batch, or people purchased from a third party seller peddling counterfeit wares.

I only love this bottle and will be ordering more when this one runs out. I recommend that you ensure that you are purchasing directly from Amazon to avoid the risk of fraudulent product, like some of the previous reviewers seemed to experience. Also, at the time of this review the product is less expensive at Nordy's, so you may want to compare the pricing at local stores.",1430179200,2015-04-28
5.0,"This serum is more like a thin cream than a watery serum. When I first opened the bottle, I had to pump it around 50 times to get it out of the container, I thought for a moment the pump was defective.

It has a pleasant scent and dries almost immediately.

This contains the form of Vitamin C which is called Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, which is a fat soluble, stable form of C. Some researchers believe this form of Vitamin C has a greater affinity for skin because its fatty acid component aids penetration and protect the vitamin from rapid oxidation. This form of vitamin C has also been shown to stimulate healthy collagen production and reduce wrinkle depth....so give this some time - maybe 60 days or so - to see any improvements. Improvements don't happen overnight.

I love the glow this gives off and I use a little of it ON TOP of my moisturizer also. I rarely use foundation and this is all I need. The glow doesn't fade away either.",1448928000,2015-12-01

3.0,"The biggest selling point about this item is that it really is refreshing. I've used this on days when it's been exceedingly hot, and spraying a little bit of this on my face cools me off and makes me feel more awake.

Its small size is also a plus, in that it's easy to throw in a purse and take with you wherever you go.

The aerosol can does lend itself to providing a decent mist, though I would caution to only use a little at a time, as it can all too easily wet the hair around the face, and using any kind of excessive amount will result in water literally dripping off of your face.

Other than that, I have to say that the price point is excessive, because at the end of the day, using this isn't any different from spending less than a dollar to get a spray bottle, filling it with water, and misting your face. This is supposed to contain minerals and be beneficial to the skin, but I haven't noticed any kind of changes or benefits. (On the plus side, it also hasn't caused me any kind of skin-related problems, which I appreciate since my skin is super sensitive.)

The bottom line for me is that it feels good to use this, but it's just water in a can, and there are many cheaper alternatives that yield the same effect.",1469318400,2016-07-24

5.0,"When it comes to make-up, sometimes certain colors do a better job of creating certain effects or' correcting issues. Lilac can correct sallowness, orange can correct dark circles, and yes, green can correct redness. Hence the Japonesque green correcting crayon, which is a really nice-sized make-up 'crayon', a nice thick one which you twist at the end to make more of the creamy, soft, foundation-like 'base' to come up (instead of having to worry about sharpening it). It can be applied directly to your face, by your fingers, a brush or a blender, whichever you prefer, and a little does well to hide a blemish or a hint of redness beneath the eyes, whatever bit of redness you're trying to hide. It blended well with the foundation I put on over it (nothing too heavy).
Though to be fair, I have fair skin and this is a light green, so it might be why it works well on me.",1439683200,2015-08-16
5.0,"Some time ago, my wife made me a gift of Burberry's French-made British cologne (or ""eau de parfum,"" ""water of perfume""), and it has become my favorite scent. So when I saw the new Burberry ""The Beat"" perfume for women, I thought I'd return the favor.

As usually with Burberry, the packaging is appealing -- which is important when you want your gift to be appreciated. The 50 ml. glass bottle comes in an impressive box, slightly oversize (5.5"" tall) . The perfume itself is well padded inside, and the glass bottle is striking. It is printed in a pattern reminiscent of the ""London"" cologne check, baked on the glass. There's a pleasing style to the whole presentation, down to the leather and metal strap on the side (says ""Burberry"").

While perfume is all about how it makes you feel, it's the contents that truly count. For this, it is impossible to top the Company's own description: ""intense and energetic scent with warm top notes of bergamot [the stuff that gives Earl Grey tea is distinctive aroma], cardamom [the Indian sweet spice], pink pepper and mandarin [citrus zest]. Heart notes of Ceylon tea, iris and bluebell add a floral texture. White musk, vetiver and cedar wood give depth to this sensual fragrance."" Yummy!

(As usual with perfume, some reviewers didn't like the scent. We do. These things are certainly a matter of personal taste!)

My wife, who was already a Burberry fan, couldn't be more thrilled, so ""The Beat"" is a hit at our house.

Ingredients lnclude: glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, shea butter, stearic acid, glycine soja (soybean) sterols, avocado oil and mango seed butter.  I combine this moisturizer with Obagi's Hydrate Luxe Moisture Rich cream at night for PM skin care which has similar products but more moisture since it is a cream not a lotion.  It is important to mention that this moisturizer dies not have SPF so I apply Obagi sunscreen cream on my face for protection from harmful UV rays.

It was so firm, I wondered how I would get it through my hair, but it melted as I rubbed it between my hands. Now. I had very dirty hair the first time I used this. It was oily, limp, and seemed beyond hope (which it was), but it did provide a good testing ground for this product. I worked it through my hair and the texture went from limp and oily to bone dry and straw-like. It felt horrible, but that dryness created volume, making my hair seem not as dirty as it had been. Curiously, it was extremely difficult to wash the product off of my hands (four washings). You will not have soft hair if you use this product. I wouldn't recommend it as a styling medium (one of the supposed uses, according to the manufacturer), but if you are extremely time challenged, or unable to wash your hair, this will help in a pinch.

2.0,"Very simply put, this product while seemingly making my lips more ""smooth and moist"" is so ridiculously overpriced, it is the epitome of the make-up industry pushing overpriced, make you feel younger, make you look younger products on the population.  Not to mention, if the opposite sex, or same sex for that matter is looking at your lips to determine the viability of a long lasting relationship, then you know what, move along from that individual.  You lips, should be the LAST thing anybody is concerned about considering anti-aging.  How about you handle those sagging eye lids, or wrinkles around your mouth, face, neck, forehead, whatever.

For the current price of nearly $85, you get just over 1/2 TBS.  Yes that is correct.  You get the luxury of paying $85 for a company that sends you just over 1/2 tablespoon of product.  Think about that.  Go look at your measuring spoons, pull out the 1 TBS and 1/2 TBS and figure you are getting something in between those two amounts for $85.

Honestly, my Burts Bees, or some other higher end lip product will make your lips feel just as good.

I seriously can't imagine anyone paying $85 for such a small amount of product and thinking that perhaps the smallest surface area on your face (your lips) are even in the conversation of anti-aging products to make you look and feel better.",1458259200,2016-03-18

I've tried a few other brands that work great but cause so much irritation it was a no-go. I've tried brands that claim to be sensitive but don't provide coverage.

3.0,"I really loved that this Jouer bronzer had a matte finish (at 61, I dislike shimmery bronzers). In addition to having a matte finish, this bronzer claims to mattify the skin.  Since I only used it for contouring (the color of the product was not something I would want to use as an all-over bronzer), I can't say for sure whether it does or doesn't mattify. I certainly didn't find its mattifying effects noticeable. Then again, where I apply contour is not usually where I'd have shine.

I'm not sure whether Jouer's bronzer comes in more than one color, but the one I am reviewing is called Sunswept. It is unlike any other bronzer color I own. In the compact, it appears almost an brownish terra cotta shade. On my skin, which was light toned for most of the time I tested this product, it was just dark enough to be seen as contour. Once I have more sun, I doubt it will even be noticeable on me. The color of the bronzer on my skin is almost peachy with orange undertones. To orangey for my taste.

I like that the bronzer compact is small and slim, while still including a fair-sized mirror and a good amount of product. However, opening the compact for the first time is like a bit like solving a puzzle. It's an odd little case that I later realized was designed to attach to other Jouer products to make a palette/collection. The method for opening the compact is not intuitive.

I feel that the $28 price tag is too high for this product, and that is coming from someone who regularly buys high-end makeup and skin care products. I am happier using my matte Revlon Photoready Bronzing Kit, which costs under 6 bucks here on Amazon. Compared to many higher-end products I've used, I didn't find the texture of this Jouer bronzer all that impressive.

Finally, this bronzer does not come with a brush. I didn't find this all that unusual, since other brands of higher-end makeup I buy don't often come with a brush either. I have my own brushes, so this was not a problem for me.

I took off 2 stars for the high price, the too-close-to-orange shade and its case being unnecessarily complicated to open/use.

5.0,"I usually go to get a facial every three weeks.  I hate making the appointment, and I hate keeping it. I have issues with keeping and making appointments.  With that being said, using your Nuface is a commitment.  You will need to make a date with your face for 15 minutes a night, five days a week.  You will see results, typically Nuface asks to use the product for 60 days to see optimal results, but for vine, we have a timeline.  After 30 days of use, I noticed my complexion is brighter, the bags under my eyes are almost null, the wrinkle between my eyes is no longer front and center, and the skin along my chin line is firmer.

To use, there is a video to view first. There is a booklet showing the directions and patterns for usage.  The booklet says if you aren't pressing hard enough the device will beep three times - this never happened, not even when I held it in my hand and didn't press it to anything.  So my advice is don't press hard, but give it a little pressure.  If your gel dries on your face or you move the device where there is no gel, you will get zapped.  It's not awful, just, well, shocking.  I acidentally got to close to my nostril, and got an electrical charge to make my eyes tear up a little.

I watched several other videos of users.  If you are on the fence, I would suggest watching these.  One woman out there has been updating her Nuface progress every month for two years.  She looks amazing, so check that video out, Google Nuface long lasting effects or something.  That's how I found it.

What I like, it doesn't take long.  I wash my face after dinner (when staying in) and for 15 minutes or less I hit my target areas, I wipe my face off, and  Devore bed wash up, put on night cream.  You need a conductor gel, Nuface comes with one, reorders are 12 dollars a tube.  I have seen several others use pure aloe. I did order some, but I haven't needed to use it yet.  My starter tube still has some gel.  What I don't like, you can not use an oil based cleanser before using Nuface, apparently it is not as effective.  I normally like to use DHC Olive Oil Cleanser to wash my face in the evening.  I feel that the oil replenishes my face.  So now at night I use my Burt's Bees cleanser before Nuface and I use deep cleansing oil in the morning.  It is a commitment.  If you don't use it regularly, it won't do any noticeable lasting good.  It is expensive.  I figured that even though my salon was reasonable, going every three weeks at $50.00 a pop, plus tip - well it was worth it.

I admit, I'm vain when it comes to my face.  If my hair turns silver, so be it, but I would like youthful skin as long as I can.  I get facials because I had heard that regularly stimulating the face muscles and tissues was good for your face.  I had not tried electrical pulses before.  I am really pleased.  It is simple to use, I'm clumsy and awkward and I found this a snap.

One weird thing I noticed, I have a few places where I get a random hair on my face, I noticed that it grows faster since I started using Nuface - it's annoying, but somewhere in my mind, I think this might be a sign that it is doing what it should be.  (Renewing and stimulating cells). When I am done using the device, my face is mildly warm, not unpleasant, another sign that something appears to be happening.  I do think it works, aside from what I noticed, but my husband recently said that I must be getting more rest at night because that luggage I've been carrying under my eyes for the last five years is gone. (And they are gone, hopefully, not to return)

I have heard complaints about customer service or that you must always charge Nuface when not in use - I can't speak to either claim.  I have had no trouble with the product at all.",1439683200,2015-08-16

The color is neutral with perhaps a subtle vanilla tint. It was a little darker than what I prefer but still workable. It applies smoothly and covers minor flaws, pores and fine lines. At most it provides medium coverage  that drys to a soft non greasy matte finish that does not look dry or chalky. My skin is slightly sensitive and ranges from normal to dry. It felt nice after application and I suffered no negative aftereffects. The coverage did seem to last and I did not need to reapply it during the day. It works well with other products like primer, blush and powder. It provides polish and is fine for work and day as well as evening outings.

Until Jouer Tint.

I got 10+ hour wear from this as a blush and the color was soft and naturally pretty on my fair skin (the color Petal looks pinker in person than the picture on amazon, more like a muted rose color). I was super impressed. I applied it with a synthetic flat brush at first, which ended up being a little too heavy. But when I took a clean kabuki brush over it, it blended out perfectly.  I did tap it on my lips as well and was happy that there was no discernible taste or scent. I think it would be nice for a no makeup look on the lips, maybe more if I layered it.

As a brand, Jouer has been hit or miss for me, but this tint is lovely.  It's half the size of my Jouer bronzer (another big hit for me) and the interlocking packaging design allowed me to connect the two products easily.",1402099200,2014-06-07

You get four products that are bigger than hotel size offerings but small enough to throw in your purse or overnight bag .. so the price is steep. Still, as another review states, tiny dabs do the trick so these should last.

Youth Activating Melon Serum reminds us that premium products demand premium outrageous names but it is, by far, the coolest product. The serum is a pastel tangerine with tiny beads floating throughout. Twist the cap and a pump pops up. Use it twice a day, applying to clean skin; it tightens the skin but doesn't really moisturize; it's not an entirely pleasant feeling. 1/2 ounce. Made in France.

The Overnight Retinol Repair Creme (another premium name!) is the best product. It feels great and smells delicious. 1/3 ounce. Made in Canada.

The Environmental Protecting Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen has the longest name (it barely fits on the tube!) and serves the most ambitious task: protecting you from UV rays, pollution, and smartphone, TV and computer screen hev light -- while it moisturizes! This smells like traditional sunscreen lotion and does feel good on the skin. Personally, I ONLY use moisturizers with a good spf rating anymore. 1/2 ounce. Made in Canada.

The Intensive Triple Exfoliating Treatment combines glycolic acid, papaya enzymes and silica beads. I have fair, mixed skin and this was too intense for me. My skin felt like paper afterward, similar to what it does after clay. This exfoliant is great for oily skin. Maybe others could add a few drops of oil to the mix .. or give it to a swarthy friend :-) 1/2 ounce. Made in Canada.

These are high quality products. I deduct one star for several reasons: the price, the mixed nature of the products (it'd be better to have one set for oily skin and another for dry), and the ingredients. Each item has a few lovely ingredients: orchids, melon, jojoba, helichrysum, sunflower seed oil, etc. But these are far outnumbered by long lists of multisyllabic chemicals. It doesn't feel like a very 'natural' experience.",1519776000,2018-02-28

4.0,"This is one of the best moisturizers I've ever used! It's so rich and creamy and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft without any greasiness. I'm a 39 year old female with very sensitive skin. My skin type is normal with an oily T-Zone and I have some redness on my chin and around my nose. This moisturizer not only leaves my skin feeling amazing but it also tones down the redness I have. My 44 year old husband has very sensitive, combination skin with slight rosacea. He's been using this moisturizer for two weeks and he said that this is his new favorite. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't care for the scent which is very faint but it smells like old lipstick. My skin loves this moisturizer so the scent doesn't bother me enough to stop using this. I highly recommend this to both men and women who have sensitive skin that's prone to redness.",1414108800,2014-10-24
5.0,"This is the absolute best makeup for people with rosacea!  I looked long and hard, trying to find one that wouldn't create a flare up.  Such a catch 22.  I want to cover my redness and bumps with foundation but wearing foundation makes it worse.  I know women around the world can relate!  Finally I found this one recommended by a number of people on a rosacea forum.  Love it and have been using it almost 2 years now.  I actually think it helps clear my rosacea.  Plus it has spf which is fantastic because every sunscreen except greasy zinc burns my face.  If you have rosacea, I understand your discouragement in looking for foundation.  Try this!  There is a case you can buy for it, but I just use the plastic it comes in.  I find it works just as well and saves money.  Golden Glow works well for my coloring too.  In the winter I wear Riviera and summer it's golden glow.",1405900800,2014-07-21
3.0,"I was hoping that Oxygen Infusion Night Cream would be more nourishing and hydrating than Skyn Icelands Cloud Cream, which is a decent moisturizer but inadequate for dry skin. I was disappointed. I have very sensitive skin almost completely lacking in barrier. Without my regular concoction of serums, my skin is painfully dry in the winter. I was hopeful that Oxygen Infusion Night Cream would help maintain some hydration in my skin, but it doesnt do much in that department. Its not for dry skin. It doesnt add any value to my serums. This cream is lighter and fluffier than Cloud Cream. It either contains more water or more air. It goes on with almost no drag. But it stings and even burns if my skin is broken. I attribute this to the fragrance, which is floral and perfumey.

So Oxygen Infusion Night Cream is not for sensitive skin. Among its active ingredients in Gosulin Agave. Skyn Iceland does not use silicone in its products. This is the primary reason that Ive been trying their products, as I cannot stand silicone on my skin, and its difficult to find a moisturizer without it. Gosulin Agave is a polysaccharide extracted from the Blue Agave plant. It is an alternative to silicone, as it mattifies and creates a velvety surface on the skin. The texture is more natural than silicone; it doesnt feel like plastic. But I find that the retexturizing agent (probably gosulin agave mixed with oils and sugars in the formula) balls up and leaves bits on the skin when applied. Cloud Cream contains a retexturizer, but its not gosulin agave and doesnt have this problem.

Neither Cloud Cream nor Oxygen Infusion Night Cream have appreciable moisturizing properties. Theyre for normal skin, not for someone who badly needs hydration. Cloud Cream is thicker and has much more drag. But, once theyve been applied, its difficult to tell them apart or it would be, if the Oxygen Infusion Night Cream were not shedding little bits of retexturizer- because they both leave a retexturized skin surface. They feel the same. Silky smooth skin and no way to tell if it is desiccated beneath the surface. This is one of the many reasons that I dislike the trend to put retexturizers in so many skin care products. Its impossible to discern the effects of the product. But I am surprised that a moisturizer at this price point is so irritating and sheds bits of itself.

The ingredient list currently posted on Amazon is incorrect. There was a formula change. This product no longer contains retinol or dimethicone (silicone). Cloud Cream contains retinol.

5.0,I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.,1467331200,2016-07-01
5.0,"I have been looking for a gentle cleanser to wash my face with. This one does the trick. I will be honest. I have never heard of Vichy before and this product is really nice. It smells good (not too sweet) and clean. It lathers up nicely with just a little bit of gel. This 6.76 fl oz bottle is going to go a long ways since you don't need a lot of gel to lather up your face. I have sensitive skin and this one does not irritate it at all.

It is a bit pricey for a facial cleanser, but when you look at how long it lasts, you're getting your money's worth.

I love the fact that it is paraben free. It seems that just about everything has these chemicals in their products and it's hard to find something that doesn't have paraben in it. This helps a lot.

I will definitely be on the outlook for more Vichy products. This is definitely going to be one of my favorite facial cleansers. It's better than Oil of Olay, which I have been using.",1447286400,2015-11-12

I use this as a water replacement step in my liquid, cream, oil routine. I love it! I use it on sectioned hair, smooth it in, and follow with PM The Conditioner, and a tiny tiny dab of coconut oil on my ends. Good moisture from this combo. Neutral scent. This is a bit thicker than the PM Lite Detangler spray, and can spray on a bit sticky if you use too much. Once my hair dries with it in, the slight stickiness feeling is completely gone and I have soft curls. It doesn't shrink my hair and leaves my hair very soft, so I will definitely repurchase. *Purchased from ULTA $13 for 17 ounce.

2.0,"I've been on the hunt for a good eye makeup remove for a while. So far all of
 the brands that have been recommended to me either aren't very good at all
 (Clinique) or contain aloe (Neutrogena). Some of the products I've wanted to
 try (like L'Oreal) had scary reviews. I had hoped that this product from Vichy
 would be different.

 The Amazon product page gives the description of the product as a ""highly
 effective, yet gentle eye make-up remover to hydrates [sic], soothe and help
 reduce the appearance of fatigue."" The product is supposed to effectively
 remove eye makeup while soothing the under eye area.

 I will say that the product is rather soothing. It doesn't irritate the
 sensitive skin around my eyes, nor has it caused any irritation or dryness or
 anything like that. It also doesn't sting if it gets into my eyes during use.
 However, it doesn't do much toward removing my eye makeup, either. No matter
 how careful I am, no matter how much I put on the cotton pad nor how much time I
 take swabbing the eye area, I still have product come off onto my towel when I
 dry my face. I cleanse my face again before bed every night, and yet I still
 wake up with black smudges under my eyes every morning.

 I confess, I do wear a lot of eye makeup - every day, I wear shadow, liner, and
 mascara. Before I ever swab with eye makeup remove, I use cold cream and a warm
 washcloth to remove most of the makeup. It doesn't get it all obviously (I wear
 contacts and you don't want to risk getting cold cream in your eye, and you also
 don't want to scrub too much in that area) but it gets a lot. The fact that
 this product can't remove what's left is a big disappointment.

 Perhaps it would work better for someone who wears less makeup. But I can say I won't be spending $17.00 for another bottle.",1455148800,2016-02-11

5.0,"Works great to hide thinning hair patches. Just shake on the areas that are thinning. Works by concealing balding scalp areas - the micro fibers lay on top of your scalp darkening the area so your otherwise shiny noggin doesn't show thru the thinning hair. Also somewhat thickens the appearance of hair. Withstands wind pretty well & moisture to some degree. Washes out easily with shampoo and water. Will also rub off on your hands if you run your hands thru your hair. Is purely a cosmetic fix to hiding hair loss. For it to work well, it's necessary for there to be some hair, even if it is fine and short, present to which the fibers can adhere and fill in. Best for concealing small patches. Causes me no irritation and don't even know I'm using it.

It helps to apply a fine hairspray to keep Toppik topic in place, but I rarely need to do this. If I do, I use a Tresemme extra fine mist spray. The scent is mild and doesn't leave you with Old Lady Aquanet smelling helmet hair. You can use any hairspray you like - Consort, American Crew, etc.

To get the best control over where the fibers go, it's best to hold the can as close to the head as possible and ever so lightly aggitate the can to shake just enough and where you want it. There is no reason to hold it high above the head - in fact, if you do, fiber will go every which way and may go where its not needed. They make a special applicator for the can to ""spray"" the fiber, but I find it more efficient to just apply keeping the regular can shaker top close to the head. For the front close to the hairline, it's best to apply back away from the hairline at first and let the fibers naturally fall forward as needed. If you apply too close to the hairline, it may look too fake. You can always come a bit closer and apply.

Works well for men and women alike. Has no scent.

Get the color that best matches your hair color. You can use 2 different colors if you are looking for a special match, but I find the Dark Brown works just find for my typical dark brown hair.

I'm a 40 yr old guy with thinning hair, but I still want to wear a pomp. Fortunately, I just have some thinning patches and not extensive balding such as MPB on top. Toppik works for me even if I use pomade to get the pomp look I like. I apply Toppik after greasing up and getting my hair partially styled. I'll add Toppik as needed to the thinning spots as I comb and style. The pomade actually seems to help keep Toppik adhering better and covers my thinning patches well. I've found that using a water based pomade as a base works best and then using a petrolatum/wax based pomade as a topper for shine really helps. I add the Toppik after applying pomades. You can add more pomade if you need to, but I usually then need to add a bit more Toppik since some will inevitably come out on your hands when applying pomade to hair that already has Toppik applied.

The stuff is not waterproof and will come out if you get your head soaked.

Face it guys, there's no miracle cure for hairloss - yet. Toppix is a good cosmetic choice for hiding hairloss, but if you're bald or otherwise don't have at least some hair to which Toppix can blend into, this may not work for you. You can always buy one of the smaller sizes to try out if unsure.",1367366400,2013-05-01

The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.)

4.0,"Moisture is the best thing about this soap, in my opinion. It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated. Many bar soaps have the opposite effect.

The scent of the 'Italian Lime and Pomegranate' bar I received is pleasant. Not overbearing, not especially feminine and not especially masculine. Just fresh. There is virtually no pomegranate smell, so I would really just call it Lime.

The size of the bar really is too big for the average sized hand. It slipped out of my grasp time and time again. I'm not complaining about the quantity of product, but I would have preferred they cut it in half and sold it as a two-pack at the same price. Of course, after a few washings, the size of the bar does reduce and becomes more practical - but that first week was a little irritating.

OVERALL: While this is obviously a luxuriant splurge of a soap and certainly a step above your Dove or similar mass-marketed soaps, it's not better than the local soaps I've bought from Whole Food stores, which smell significantly better and offer a more thorough clean. Personally, I would not pay the current listing price ($16.00) for another bar, but I understand that disposable money varies from person to person, so I rated it based solely on my experience with the product.

I might try again in a few months and see if the same thing happens again, if it does, I'll come back and revise the review according to those results.",1489190400,2017-03-11
4.0,"This is quite a nice curling iron.  It seems to be well constructed and is an attractive appliance.  The colors are white with copper-ish colored trim.  I expect the copper color to definitely wear off with frequent use, but for starts it's the loveliest curling iron I've ever seen.  And I guess it should be for $185.00.  I have several curling irons and brushes stuffed under my bathroom sink right now and none of them compare to this one.  The clip that holds hair against the heated barrel is strong and the clip must be opened to release hair once it's been curled.  You will not be able to easily pull it out without losing some hair so be sure to open it again.

The various 5 heat settings are really nice to have and are very easy to set.  I don't like it very hot but my daughter has very tough hair and needs to use the highest heat setting.  The T3 Micro Twirl Convertible Curling Iron comes (I believe because it's not quite super clear) with a straight 1.25 barrel but you can purchase different sizes of barrels.

It heats up fast and they include a black pad to rest the hot barrel on when you lay it down on your bathroom countertop.  I think that was a very nice extra since it could possibly damage it if it was really hot.  The tip of the barrel does not heat up so you can hold it with your bare fingers if you need too.  Still be careful though, because you have less than an inch of ""cool tip"" to hold onto.  The cord is nice an long and should give you plenty of room to work especially if you only have one electrical outlet and have to share the counter space with someone.  And the cord swivels from the end so getting your cord all curled up shouldn't be a problem.  It also has a 1-hour automatic shut off (which I admit, I haven't tested yet).

It's got a nice weight too.  It might get your arm tired for a while until you get used to it.  The instructions are well written with good diagrams so even if you don't read English you can still understand it, but then I guess you won't understand this review lol. I expect this curling iron to last me for YEARS since it's so pricey.  Hopefully, I will never have to purchase another one.  I like this curling iron a LOT but am only giving it 4 stars for now.  I have to give something like this some time to see how it holds up and then I will come back and update this review.",1444089600,2015-10-06
4.0,"MEG21 is a skin care line created by a  PHD research scientist, and has some serious science to back up its claims.. The main active ingredient, supplamine, is a combination of two aminos that work together to  treat glycation.  Glycation is a major cause of skin aging, and is cause by sugars attaching to collagen and elastic, creating inflammation and less resilient skin.  Supplamine not only prevents the toxic sugars from being made, but it also works to neutralize existing toxic sugars.

So now with that background information out of the way, I can share how my experience with it has been.  I have rather sensitive skin, and many anti-aging products have caused irritation and stinging when I apply it.  This serum hasn't caused any problems for me in terms of discomfort or irritation.  The product information says it takes at least 28 days for full effects to be seen, so I will have to update this review after a few weeks use in order to evaluate that claim.  However it does leave my skin feeling well hydrated and is not sticky or unpleasant feeling.

This is only 1 ounce of product, so at close to $100, is rather expensive.  At this point it is hard to say if that price is justified, but I'm hoping I'll have positive results to report back after a month.",1471910400,2016-08-23
4.0,"As far as sensitivity goes, this is a 5 star product. I have very sparse lashes, but my eyes also get irritated by makeup, so it's great for that. But it's not the best mascara I have for long thick lashes. I think it's great for normal days when I only use mascara and don't apply any other eye makeup. Because my eyelashes are sparse and very light, it gives a little pop, like I have eyelashes.

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

4.0,"My wife told me that she could smell me walking down the steps the first time I used this yesterday. I think that's more because the bathroom door was open and I went back to get dressed before coming downstairs. The first use out of the bottle was also more than was required because it was difficult to get a small amount out since this is a balm (leave a little more headspace!) and not a spray bottle.

I feel like the pungent aroma faded rather quickly. It was evident when we got in the car some 30 minutes later, but it was never mentioned again that day. I normally wear Acqua Di Gio, which I find to be a little more refreshing than this Burberry product. I will continue to alternate between these two products as this is a pleasant scent. It receives 5/5 stars on most all of the other websites out there.

The spin top bottle is a bit annoying... You have the product on your hands from application, and then have to close the bottle which is difficult because your hands are now quite slippery. You'll be washing the threaded bottle cap after every use.",1404086400,2014-06-30

I use this after applying moisturizer and under a light application of liquid make-up.

3.0,"The Henckels Twinox Grooming Set is a beautifully packed grooming set.  Everything is wonderfully packaged in a leather holding case, the nail clippers are ultra slim and cuts nails with great ease, and the nail file does a fine job of getting everything well filed down.  The nose hair clipper, however falls short from the mark.  I don't mind that it's manually operated, as it give the user control over the speed of the clipper.  I also like how it can rotate in either direction, so that if a hair gets caught, you can reverse the direction so the pulling ceases.  Unfortunately, hairs do seem to get caught fairly easily with this unit, and while it's not as shocking to get a hair yanked like with an electric trimmer, I expected much more from a Henckels product and expected no hair yanking at all!  I'm guessing that if hairs are getting caught and yanked now - while new and at it's sharpest - it may cause larger amounts of pain later.  If you have a higher threshold for pain, or don't get phased at a nose hair yank or two, this set is truly a handsome grooming set.  Just be aware the nose trimmer is like any other trimmer - hairs will most likely get yanked.",1442016000,2015-09-12
4.0,"Firstly, I have never tried a body wash, but use high quality soaps.  I was offered this Jack Black Epic Moisture Clean Cream Body Wash for review, so I took the opportunity to expand my horizons,  At $26.00 for 12 fluid ounces, it is priced somewhere between Body Shop products and Crabtree & Evelyn.

I followed the instructions and used a washcloth to get the lather worked up.  I needed about five, easy to use, pumps to lather my entire body.  The smell was clean and refreshing.  The list of ingredients are a who's who of oils, root extracts and natural fragrances mixed with the usual chemicals needed to produce the lather.  While I did feel it cleaned my body, I was more impressed by the moisturizing aspect of the body wash, which left my skin feeling smooth and comfortable.

Below is a list of the ingredients from their website:

Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Water (aqua), Canola Oil, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate,sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Fragrance (parfum), Argania Spinosa (argan) Kernel Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea Butter), Moringa Oleifera (moringa) Oil, Olea Europaea (olive) Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (jojoba) Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (sunflower) Seed Oil*, Aloe Barbadensis (aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Bht, Limonium Gerberi Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (rosemary) Leaf Extract*, Camellia Sinensis (green Tea) Leaf Extract*, Olea Europaea (olive) Leaf Extract*, Inula Crithmoide Flower/leaf Extract, Cocamide Mipa, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Cyamopsis Tetragonoloba (guar) Gum,guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid, Coconut Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Dihydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Borate, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Phenoxyethanol*Certified Organic

5.0,If you have any type of facial scarring this product is excellent. My daughter has some acne scars and she used it under her make up.  This noticeably lessened their appearance. A little goes a long way. She used just a small amount and blended it into her skin. She is fair skinned and this worked great with her complexion. It is thicker than regular makeup but since she used a small amount it did not look cakey at all. This blended easily with her skin.  She used her fingertips but a make up sponge will do the trick beautifully too.,1498521600,2017-06-27
3.0,"I'm not a scent-wearing person. But I was cajoled into giving this a try. I really liked the smell - it had a nice non-overpowering slightly citrus scent that didn't overpower anyone near me nor make me sneeze profusely as some cologne does. However, the smell faded away in about an hour, which was disappointing. Supposedly the scent lingered for a while after that, but it wasn't noticeable to me. I don't know if it's watered down or it just fades away quickly, but it didn't last as long as I'd like. It was nice smelling, however, but I don't want to douse myself in it so it lasts more than a few hours.",1458604800,2016-03-22

I experimented and took a full eye close up before using this.  Then I followed the stated directions, apply morning and night to a clean face.  I did this for more than two weeks.  I retook the pictures and enlarged them to a scary size.  No difference to this typically 55-year-old female face.

It doesnt absorb immediately.  It goes on smooth, feels nice.  Too pricy for no results.  But I recognize my experiments flaw that my face treatments may have already got me to a place of no more improvements using creams.  Ill keep using it, but will not purchase it.",1458950400,2016-03-26

I have short/medium hair and it is perfectly straight and flat.  I thought that if I applied this to my roots it would uplift my hair and keep it from looking so flat.  That didn't work.

5.0,"I've been a huge fan of this lip balm since it was mentioned in the newly started Lucky magazine and sold at Sephora. (Yes, that long ago!) It's texture is rich, thick and gives my lips a very cushiony feeling. I love that it's very matte, no shine at all and that it works equally well on its own or under lip color. The scent is not that of honey, but a light citrus that is so nice, not overpowering, not yucky or artificial.
I barely have to touch this balm with my fingertip to get the perfect lip amount, its that soft and creamy. (Seriously, don't slide your finger over it, I made that mistake the first time I used it, all that will do is pick up way too much and put a dent in the middle!) Plus, the transfer of product from fingertip to lip is amazingly neat and tidy. No extra product I have to wipe off!
The balm lasts for a long time, even with me constantly pressing my lips together to see if it's still there. I actually look forward to applying more and am a little bummed because it doesn't need it that often! :)

Pricing: Its definitely expensive, but most such products are.

Packaging: The bottle looks nice on her dresser, with a pleasant shape and color.  More importantly, the pump in the bottle works well, and distributes the appropriate amount with each press (not too much, not too little).

Fragrance: The fragrance is pleasant but very subtle, which is good for a product you'll be putting on before sleeping.  There should be no worries about it keeping you up.

Efficacy: Most importantly, the product worked.  My wife noticed that dark circles and fine lines were diminished after several days of use.

As someone who has a skin tone in the fair-light range with neutral undertones I was really pleased that it didn't look too warm or cool on me either. The color I got, Petal, is a very flattering pink that I think would look great on anyone.

I didn't quite love it as a lip-tint since it's on the dry side of creamy (if that makes sense) and made my lips look flat and dry but it paired well layered under lip balm for a more tinted-balm look than a lipstick. I would love to try Honeysuckle and Poppy to see if they might not be great lip colors for me.

As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

The cystic zit was gone within three days of using juice beauty, which is impressive.  The blackheads cleared up within a week.  The blemish on the chin, well that beast is just winding down, three weeks later.  To use juice beauty, wet face, apply cleanser, scrub, rinse.  My package came with a nice little washcloth, which aided in the scrubbing. After you pat your face dry you put some blemish serum on, it comes in a little tube, it's very runny, so squeeze with caution or you'll get a whole mitt full.  You can apply the serum to just blemishes or the whole face.  I went with the whole face approach, which I liked, because it has a little tightening effect after you put it on, it's great.  Wait a few moments before putting the moisturizing lotion on otherwise you have a white creamy mess on your face, when the serum isn't quite dry and you put the moisturizer on right away...you get a mess.  The face mask, was, nothing impressive.  It comes in a little jar, you scoop it out and put it on, wait ten minutes, then rinse off.  The mask never tightened, or made my face feel any different.  So the mask, didn't do a thing for me.  I really like the cleanser and the serum.

I have sensitive, thin skin and am prone to a few of those deep pimples you can feel coming before you see them... This worked like a charm on one of those - the pimple never broke. I do not have problem skin in the sense of acne, but I'm cautious about anything I add to the mix.

Pros:
Non-drying and didn't feel heavy
No strong scents or perfumes
Worked well as a spot treatment on a developing pimple
Helped smooth larger area of skin prone to bumps but not pimples (unclogged the pores!)
A little bit was all that I needed to make a difference

Cons:
The print on the bottle is microscopic.
If I apply too much, especially over a larger area (not just a pimple spot), it feels a little like a very thin layer of white glue drying (remember grade school?) - this improved when I started massaging it in with my fingertips

My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair.  And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)!  The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie.  Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar.  It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets.  I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity  because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product!  Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair.  Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place.  Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair.  Instead of enhancing his look,  Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place.",1339286400,2012-06-10
5.0,"I didn't think this would clean my very dirty brushes but it worked!
I wear full make up at least five days a week, using at least 4 -6 brushes a day. In all honesty, I don't clean my brushes as I should,  going weeks without cleaning them. This is why I was so surprised this product cleaned my brushes after three swirls and about 10 minutes.
I used a rag instead of a paper towel as recommended because I thought my 6 brushes needed more than a paper towel to get clean.  Anyway I squirted each brush with the solution and set it down on a white rag.  Re-squirted and rubbed one brush in a circular pattern until it looked clean and somewhat dry.
I repeated with each brush, turned the rag over to the clean side and repeated the whole thing again.  At this point the brushes were visibly clean and soft, but I repeated one more to to make sure.  They really cleaned up nicely and smelled nice too.  I didn't have to dry them over night and then comb them to get them looking nice.
I will use this weekly since it's so quick and easy to use.",1457827200,2016-03-13

5.0,"I don't wear makeup on a daily basis, but I do like using concealer or foundation when I have a reason to dress up.  This Dermablend concealer stick does a great job covering up dark circles, pimples, freckles, scars or other imperfections on the face (or on other areas of the body).  I got the ""tan"" color, which works well with light to medium caucasian skin tones, although it comes in a variety of shades for every skin color.  It goes on thick and has to be blended but it does blend into invisibility.  It's a little greasy, but for my middle aged skin that's a bonus - some products tend to accentuate wrinkles or stand out if they are too dry.  I like the lipstick-type tube that rolls up and down, and I like the amount of product in the tube.  I applied it in the morning and it had staying power until afternoon, when I realized it had worn off.  It's summertime here in NC, and no makeup can stay on all day with the heat and humidity.

Second, the ""woodsy"" scent is pretty intolerable to me and it lingers.  It did not cause a sinus headache, but I simply can't stand it.  Third, even though I have combination skin, the mask left my skin feeling tight and dry.  I might have expected that in the winter, when electric heat dries out my skin, but not in the summer.  (The product is recommended for combination to oily skin.)  On a positive note, however, it is a good clarifying mask; it does leave your skin bright and clean.

5.0,"Both my teenaged daughter and I tried this peel, and we both love it.

I am a middle-aged woman with combination skin and get the occasional adult acne cyst.  I gave this peel a run for its money, as I am currently suffering from extremely dry winter skin as well as a painful, large zit trying to emerge on my jawline.  I use masques several times a month but this was my first peel.  The texture of the peel is very thin, which is good, because the product will go a very long way since you don't need much.  The jar is small and even so, you can't tell after one use that any is gone.  I anticipate it lasting longer than masques in containers twice its size.  So while it is expensive, per use it will probably end up being less than my usual mid-range masques.

I thought I would have to tolerate the smell, since I am not a fan of apple-scented anything that is not, well, apples themselves.  But it is a very pleasant, very light, clean and fresh smell, similar to facial treatments I have had done at spas or medical spas.  It goes on very light, no frozen face or feeling of cracking.  It is transparent enough that I could run to the school to pick up the kids and no one in neighboring cars would be able to tell there was something on my face.

I was genuinely amazed about how well this peel works.  How could it be blemish clearing and moisturizing at the same time?  But it is.  My skin is very noticeably less dry, and this after I'd been applying a thick facial cream once or twice a day for several days prior.  And the zit--it took me a minute even to find it after using this peel only once for about 10 minutes.  It is much smaller and dried out feeling, like how I would expect it to feel after a day and a night of treating with my Proactiv zit cream.  The overall appearance of my face has improved as well.  Nothing remarkable, after all it was only one use and I have been using masques all along, but the color seems a little more even, and the pores perhaps a bit smaller.

The directions mention that you might feel a slight tingling when applying this peel, and it was so slight as to be almost imperceptible.  My skin was not at all irritated during or after the peel.

My teenaged daughter has highly sensitive skin.  She has to use a special, gentle face cleaner as well as special makeup remover.  She was able to use this peel with no irritation whatsoever.  I forgot to mention to her possible tingling and she didn't say anything about it.  She had a few little breakouts on her face and was pleased that they were significantly smaller afterwards.  She also kept touching her face saying she loves how soft it feels.  She and I both agreed her skin looks brighter, too.  She has two presentations to give in school tomorrow and was happy to have tried the peel tonight because of how it has improved the look of her skin.

Based on my and my daughter's experience, I would definitely recommend this peel to anyone looking to moisturize, clear or brighten their skin.",1415750400,2014-11-12

4.0,"I just finished a whole jar. My acne didn't improve but didn't get worse either. I think to truly test I should've tried their whole set! However, from the cream alone, I like it. Its consistency is between a gel and a cream, more on a heavy side. I have oily skin, this stuff won't help with the oiliness, I always woke up with a shiny face when using this cream, but as I learned not being too obsessed with the oil on my face, I can see that my skin is well hydrated even after a face wash. It did tingle when I applied over my pimples (new or popped) so I guess something was working (or irritating!)

For some reason this stuff went really fast for me. It didn't glide too well on my skin. I may repurchase this in the future, but now I'm still looking for a better product that is more suited for my skin and my budget. I can imagine this cream can work for many other people",1484697600,2017-01-18
4.0,"I have never used any kind of blemish clearing serum before. I never needed one before either. When I saw this offered in my Vine que, I thought I'd try it especially since I have been dealing with some blemishes due to the weather changing, age and stress. I didn't have a lot of blemishes, but the few that I did have cleared up right away and my face actually felt better than it has in weeks.

I have sensitive skin, with the occasional reddening and this works like a charm. It didn't leave my skin dried out. It cleared up the blemishes and tightened my pores even. I really enjoyed it and am willing to pay the price for it too.

I am not much for facial cleanser since I feel that they promise results that are not usually backed up by facts. This one though has changed my mind and will definitely check out the rest of this collection. I do like how it feels on my face and it also leaves my face feeling clean. I don't get that feeling with a lot of products.",1416355200,2014-11-19
4.0,"This is a great little set in a leather pouch that neatly and securely holds all three tools.

The fingernail clippers are outstanding. I already had a set of these that I bought around ten years ago and use on a regular basis, so I can attest to the fact that they hold up well over time. They are the sharpest clippers I've ever seen, and fold up into a little slim package. The folding action is very cool, but does take a little examination to figure out. When I travel with clippers, these are the ones I always take. Two things to note here, though. The jaws don't open very wide compared with other clippers, so it is a bit harder to stick your nail in there. They are also not very wide, so cutting off a nail will take multiple cuts. The super-sharp blades, however, will cut through even tough nails like mine, so that's a big advantage.

Five stars for the clippers.

So, what about the other two tools? Well, they aren't as impressive, unfortunately.

There is nothing really wrong with them, but the tweezers, although functional, are average. Tweezerman makes far better tweezers than these, and they are reasonably priced and readily available.

I've personally never understood why metal nail files are even made. It seems there is one of these in every manicure kit, but they are incredibly coarse, and will leave your nails ragged. I guess it is good to have in an emergency, like if you get a chip in your nail and want to make sure it doesn't snag on anything or tear and get worse, but I would never use one of these under normal circumstances.

I'm not going to take off a star for the overall price, because the clippers by themselves are expensive, and the case is nice and works well. Sometimes cases like this have large holes on the sides of them that let the tools fall out - this one does not have that problem. It is leather, not plastic, which is also a plus. I'd replace the tweezers with a higher-quality set and use the one in the set as a backup pair. The nail file I'd replace with a couple of disposable files.

So, five stars for the clippers, and less so for the rest.

5.0,"My stylist told me about Toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be. She purchased the 0.36oz/10.3g for me from the local beauty supply. Even with her discount it was almost $25. But I really liked how Toppik camouflages my thin spots. Only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair. Only one person realized what the difference was, and only because she'd also used Toppik.

Toppik is now a must-have product for me so I started looking for a better bargain and found it here. I get almost more than twice the product for only a few $ more.

2.0,"I've heard very good things about this brand, and was excited to try this cleanser. I'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so I keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). This cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal.

Pros:
1. Only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer
2. Rinses clean, without residue
3. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin
4. Doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean
5. Doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse

Cons:
1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the ""cooling action"" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the ""cleansing"" part.
2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes.
3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something.
4. Expensive. Considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. I've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. If I'm spending more, I'd rather invest in Algenist or La Mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).

Overall, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this cleanser.",1486080000,2017-02-03

I did not burn the entire 2 weeks of outdoor exposure. The product feels smooth and silky on my skin. I do feel it looks overly matte and chalky on me, even at the end of the day.

5.0,"I have used Neutrogena eye make-up remover for many years.  I use it on my eyes and face. Neuteogena still has the cheapest price.  If you want to upgrade, Vichy is as good as department store brands like Lancme, and costs about the same, or less on Amazon.

Vichy make up remover does its job. A lot of make-up came off on the cotton page I used to wipe the make-up remover on my face. It has a creamy consistency.  This make-up remover hydrates and is gentle on your face.  Even though Neutrogena works well to remove make-up and is the cheapest, it doesn't have the extra soothing ingredients like this one.  I use other products to hydrate my under eye area, but using a make-up remover like Vichy means I have more products working together to help my face.  Hydration is especially important in winter.  Due to my budget, I'm going to switch back and forth between the Neutrogena and this Vichy Eye Make up remover. I recommend both depending on your needs.

I would not be able to use this head daily but for a weekly treatment it is perfect for making my skin look as good as possible. The difference was especially noticeable around my nose and forehead. I do recommend this head for vigorous deep cleaning.",1480723200,2016-12-03

You can also use lighter shades for highlighting and dark colors for contouring to get that perfect face This product has not caused any irritation to my skin and works extremely well.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19

1.0,"It made me break out, especially my chin area .  To be fair though, I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  However, I do recommend their Bioglycolic cleanser which really helps to exfoliate.",1461888000,2016-04-29
5.0,I am very happy with the quality of the polish and the color is simply beautiful on my tanned feet.,1403395200,2014-06-22
2.0,"The exfoliating quality of Baxter of California Night Cream AHA comes from this lotion's glycolic acid base, which is a very mild alpha hydroxyl formulation.  After several weeks of use, I saw no redness as I've experienced with other exfoliants.  But neither did I see any real change in my skin.

I like the feel of it:  non-oily, dry, almost talc-y. Dense, yet easily spreadable.  And a dab covers quite a bit of territory.  But after 30 minutes, my skin feels no different than before.  Night Cream AHA is not entirely odorless for me;  it's got an elusive ""nearly chemical"" fragrance.  I'm grateful it's not spicy, floral, herb-like, or overly medicinal, and I'm also grateful it's not long-lasting.

My spouse said, ""It feels nice, non-greasy, and unobjectionable"".

But something about Baxter's Night Cream AHA is bothering my eyes, causing unusual dryness and minor stinging.  This happens even though I apply the product far, FAR from my eyes and even if I just put it on the back of my hand.

So I started looking into the list of ingredients, which I included below.  Some compounds - such as certain fatty alcohols - may be derived from animals or plants.  BOC makes no claim that the Night Cream AHA is vegan, so there is no reason to expect that it is.  Other ingredients like hydrogenated polyisobutene have used animals in testing (and yes, there were deaths).  Still others - sorbitan stearate, glyceryl stearate, and cetyl alcohol - have been considered toxic and environmentally dangerous in Canada.  Then there are the four (FOUR) parabens, i.e. preservatives, recently associated with breast tumors.  Granted, parabens have not been found to _cause_ cancer, and they can exist naturally in some foods (grapes, flaxseed) and even show up in some OTC pain relievers.  But Denmark has seen fit to ban butylparaben from certain child-oriented products.  The fact that BOC chooses to use FOUR parabens is worrisome.

This uneasy ingredient list, along with no visible results except for the dry, stinging eyes, makes me happier to just do without BOC right now.  It was a nice-to-have that was nice to try, but ultimately it might not be so nice to Earth and animals.  Humans included.

5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

5.0,"This is a UV cured 'gel' polish.  And by far my FAVORITE color so far.  I wear a lot of earthy colors especially going into fall and winter and RUBBLE is a warm taupe brown that just goes with everything.  It will dress up beautifully with one or two layers of gold VIP layered over it.  Done properly, a CND Shellac will last 1-3 weeks.

 I have softer flexible nails - My nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer.  Acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic 'off brand' gel polish, they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak.  Before Shellac I gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day.  I type a lot at work as well as boxing and packing stuff so I am tough on my hands.  Shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy WITHOUT any filing.  It lasts me about 7-10 days on dark colors, because I chose to take it off when I can see growth at the cuticle.",1345939200,2012-08-26
4.0,"Styling hair is not something I do well. I'm kind of a dunce at it. So this review will be for people like me who want to know the basics. Unlike most of my hair styling tools, this one had a simple, easy-to-use plug.  It was very simple to turn on and off, with an excellent operating display that shows clearly if it is turned on or not, and to allow you to change the temperature switch. To do that, you just press the power button until it gets to the one you want, after getting to hottest setting, press again and you're back to the lowest setting.  When the lights turn SOLID, you can start using it. If you want to turn it off, press and hold the Power & Temperature Switch. I don't trust myself or the iron enough to leave it plugged in though, so I just unplug it.

The Singlepass Luxe comes with a couple of clips to help section off the hair. You're supposed to use thin horizontal sections so the iron can be positioned close to the roots.  I need to work on that.

It worked well on my hair, which is in the 'fine' category.  There's a little chart in the instructions that says you should slow down as you use the iron and glide it through the direction of hair growth at a speed slower than when you brush your hair. If you have fine hair, they suggest 2-3 inches per second, medium hair, 2 inches per second, and course hair, 1 inch per second.  My hair looks good now that I've finished styling it, so I guess even though I didn't section it off perfectly into thin horizontal sections, it works for me.  I think I'll be able to do better with practice.

I wanted to do some little curls in the front. There were no instructions on how to do that. I'll need some

They did mention several times not to wind the cord around the flat iron because it will shorten the life of the iron.",1479081600,2016-11-14

The scent does not overpower and does fade relatively quickly - it does not feel like you're wearing a cologne. I can't really speak to the detoxing abilities but the clay does make it feel a bit softer on the skin and it does not dry out the skin as much.,1479427200,2016-11-18

5.0,"Product Quality: 5 Stars
Product Value: 5 Stars
Packaging: 5 Starts (though, note that it contains no brush)
Sandalwood color: Only 4 stars.

I found this to be a lovely quality blush and an excellent value.  Very happy with the product quality, though I would have preferred a pinker color (I received this free to review so I wasn't able to choose my own color).  I have the Sandalwood, which is a bit more of an orange-ish-apricot shade than the photo implies.  It is NOT actually orange, just a warmer, less-pink color.  The photo seems to contain a smidge more pink than the actual product.  I will definitely re-order, but I will choose a pinker shade (perhaps the Blossom or Rose).  This color is very wearable, but won't complement the pinker lip colors I usually prefer.

The product is actually excellent.  It is intensely pigmented (this is a good thing: you need little product to complete your look).  One swipe on the product, one swipe on the cheek, and you have a lovely amount of color. This is also a large product pan, so I expect this to last you at LEAST a year.

The finish is very natural.  Especially when used with a good brush.  I think this is the best blush I have ever used.

There is no brush included, which I prefer (who uses those teeny brushes usually packaged with blushers?), but that detail is work noting.  Also the compact is sleek and opens easily (after the first time anyway) and stays closed when closed.  I like the sleep black.

I completely recommend this prduct.",1390608000,2014-01-25

3.0,"I'm reviewing this ""early"" (i.e., the company recommends using this for 60 days and I've been using it for 30), however the deadline for this review was half-way through the recommended period over which you would see dramatic results.  I'm not a spa person, so the little shocks were a bit off-putting, though as I've improved my technique, I don't go past my hairline as much and have minimized shocks.  If you are sensitive to pain, this may not be the treatment for you. It's not a big, bad shock, just a little zap which can be unsettling if you're  not prepared for it.

The good:  Lots of great videos to help the neophyte learn how to use this tool.  Also, it's a great size, not clunky & fits very ergonomically into your hand.

The bad: I'm a busy person & don't see this as a permanent fixture in my routine.  They have a video where a woman is using the device while ushering children off to school  I'm not a multi-tasker.  I'm also uncoordinated.so I prefer to be in front of a mirror when using this, even after four weeks.  Also, you will be spending money for the face lubricant every few months, so add that to the list of considerations when contemplating purchasing this product.  (Disclaimer- I don't know how much this process is worth in spa dollars, so you may come out ahead!)

The upshot - it's a well-designed machine.  I didn't see a great deal of difference, but the ritual itself is very soothing.  I say, if this is your thing, then it's probably worth the price.",1440806400,2015-08-29

It's very easy to build up to cover any problem areas so if you want light coverage in one area but need better coverage in another you can do it with this instead of having to use a heavier makeup on your entire face. I suggest using a primer made for mineral type makeup and using their setting powder if you want all day coverage.

How often does skin cream dry up in the jar? Additionally, there were no instructions, so I ended up pulling off the whole top mechanism with first use.

More problematic are the smell and the chemical ingredients. For me, the smell, although mild, is unpleasant. And take another look at those ingredients.

As I get older, my skin turns dry beginning around this time every year and stays dry until May.  So I'm looking for a good mask.  Application is easy.  A little bit goes a long way.  It's a cooling gel.  It's thinner than Vaseline but thicker than water.  At first, I thought that this would be my first disappointment in the Vichy line.  I'm used to slathering on thick creams to get the results I needed.  I shouldn't have worried.  Although it seems a bit thin, this gel was moisturizing.  I used it at night and my dry patches around my crows feet were noticeably less creased.  This lasted for two days so it's not a permanent solution.

This product is one I got for evaluation and I tried it with their shampoo. The results were excellent on my thin hair. My wife tried it too and her hair is much thicker but the results were equally good. Lots of soft feeling tresses.

The scent is fresh and minty / herbal without being flowery - excuse the expression - it smells manly.

Why 4 and not 5 stars ? The recommendation to use a quarter-sized amount is too large. I tried a dime-sized / penny-sized amount (my wife says pea sized) and it worked just fine. Also, they say apply the conditioner first and leave it on while you wash. The problem with that is the product doesn't wash off easily. I feel a slippery film on my face, arms, etc. If you wash first and then rinse off the conditioner, you have to rewash to get all of the conditioner off.

The gloss has a faint nougat sweet kind of scent.  I like this,  and would reconsider repurchasing, but would be afraid to purchase online because the color swatches do not match reality.  Based on the swatches I would have expected no 4 to be a very warm clay pink.  It is actually a very cool  dark peony kind of pink.

They say the powder will fix makeup and prevent transfer for up to 16 hrs (I've tried for about 8 at a stretch and it works). However, there are two issues that made me knock off a star: 1) applying it to two full legs, over makeup, is messy! You could stand on an old towel I guess. I have a large bathtub so I sit on one side with my legs over the tub and put it on. When done, I can flush the speckles of dropped powder down the drain using the handheld shower nozzle. 2) It's kind of hard to get off! My best bet is to get in the shower at the end of the day and scrub my legs with body wash on a brush, or rough facecloth.

It's good for what it claims to do, and it would probably be a lot easier to apply and remove over face makeup.

I also use a thin layer on areas that I feel may break out (like freshly tweezed brows) and it is great for prevention.

I docked a star for the frustrating package it comes in. If the bottle was a little wider and shorter it would be perfect. When you get to the bottom of the bottle, you can't really reach it with a regular sized felt-tipped swab, for one thing, and for another usually the alcohol will completely dry out before you even get to the stuff so it dries into powder (I have gone through two bottles already).

It is one of the best products I've had the opportunity to test and rate.  The scent is so lovely.  It is hard to describe.  But with my limited ability to capture it's beauty, I will say it is sexy, sophisticated, elegant.  It's not fruity or sweet. (If it is, that part of it is subtle.)

I only spray on a very small amount, because too much perfume can (and probably will be) a disaster, and most everybody will be offended.  So unless someone says ""no perfume because someone has allergies or because someone doesn't like it"", then I only spray a very minute amount - only enough for it to make you have a scent of cleanness and elegance, rather than having a smell of mustiness.",1431129600,2015-05-09

It smells heavenly if you like vanilla (I love vanilla). It gives a buildable, non-orange tan that lasts for about a week unless you fail to exfoliate before use. It dries fast, so if you apply it just after showering and before bedtime, it will dry during your short walk from the bathroom to the bedroom. Don't expect any moisturization from this mousse. It is a self-tanner only. If you want moisture, you will need to add it separately.

5.0,"The great thing about scents is that they smell a little differently on every person and mix with your body chemistry to sometimes change the scent into a fragrance that is entirely pleasing or one that is totally nauseating. This one, Artisan by John Varvatos, worked great for my husband -- who is a die hard Acqua di Gio fan (and I love that cologne too). I am really into scents that are more ""fresh"" and lighter than the heavy stuff like Drakkar Noir, etc. so I was very happy he liked this too. I actually wore this myself to work one day just because I like the smell, and I didn't mind that it sort of 'wore off' slowly over a couple of hours.

On him it has a citrus start when he first sprays it on and then after it dries it has a more woody scent though I find it very hard to analyze the different components of a perfume or cologne. I didn't smell the floral component as strongly as others have mentioned. I like that it is pleasant and not overpowering, and actually, I'm glad it doesn't stay at max potency for hours and hours. I don't want a man's smell to overwhelm my senses while I'm eating or on a bus or plane. Just a hint or whiff of fragrance works -- not like he's bathed in a tub full.  I think that liking or not liking a scent is a very particular thing for each person. That's why it is so important to ""try on"" a scent just as you do with other things you wear. Fragrance can make a statement about you and it might take awhile for you to find one that says what you want it to.

It presents with a caramel-colored rattan woven cover over the spray bottle inside a cardboard box. If you like citrus and woody smells on a man, you would probably like this but I'd suggest you try a sample first before you buy the whole bottle.",1457568000,2016-03-10

What I love about it is that it truly feels like a cross between a balm and a lipstick.  Like a balm, it feels moisturizing, and wearable, and doesn't dry lips out or settle in lip lines.  It has a nice creamy texture.  But like a lipstick it's more pigmented and gives noticeable color with a more opaque look.  As far as wear time goes, I get a few hours out of this, BUT I'm also tough on my lipstick.  I'm often drinking and eating a lot and biting my lips so under these conditions I don't expect lipstick, gloss or balm to last an incredibly long time.  So for me, it seems on par to other lipsticks I've tried.  As far as application goes, I agree that the shape of the bullet can be less than ideal.  If I'm in a hurry I still find I can do a good enough job at creating a defined lip look, but ideally I find myself applying it with a lip brush when I can.  I also happen to enjoy the scent of this balm.  It has a soft vanilla mint scent to me (vs. a strong, pure mint) that I find really pleasant and enjoyable.  I have a sensitive nose for fragrance and sometimes added scents give me a headache, but I don't get that with this product.

4.0,"I have no idea what ""notes of spicy black pepper and smoky guaiac complemented by sweet and resinous opoponax and elegant lavender for an added touch of distinction"" is supposed to mean (or smell like), but this is a very nice men's cologne.

I guess you might say it's got a ""warmer"" scent than Polo, but I don't think it *lasts* quite as well.  The cloth covering the bottle is an interesting look, although it doesn't allow you to see how much is left.

If this Body Wash had been a different flavor, I may have liked it. The Bergamot and Pear is not an appealing scent to me. It is all Bergamot, no noticeable Pear. The scent is very sweet, and almost medicinal. My husband refused to use it as a body wash due to the scent, so we moved it to the sink for hand washing purposes. The cloying fragrance lingers on hands, though, and we ended up trashing it because no one in the household liked the smell.

- Brazilian Nut Extract, high in fatty acids and Vitamin E, protects the hair from damage and the elements. - Tara Plant heals damaged hair by moisturizing and thickening strands.  - Color and keratin treatment safe. UV protection for hair. Vegan, cruelty-free and gluten-free.""

3.0,"I am still getting used to this shaver so I'll list what I like and don't like and add to the review if familiarity changes my opinion.

What I like:

I love that I can take it into the shower and that it is cordless.  I like shaving in the shower because shavers and razors seem to grab less when my skin and hair is wet.  But sometimes I'd rather shave under my arms in front of the mirror because I can see the places I miss.  The combination of going anywhere and especially in the shower is a major plus for me.

I like the little piece for doing longer hair.  Given the things I'm not so wild about, I think it will be a long time before I try a bikini shave, but if I haven't shaved all winter and am getting ready for spring, that attachment definitely comes in handy.

What I didn't like:

This is the first ""electric"" shaver I have ever used -- I've been shaving with a razor my whole life.  And I think there may be a learning curve on how to hold it,  But the leading edge caught on a large skin tag under my arm and cut it.  I also manage to catch just regular skin under my arms in that leading edge and keep getting places that are almost like razor burns.  Later on they turn into sore red lines under my arms.  I am hoping that practice will teach me how to shave under my arms without tearing them up.

A shaver doesn't give me the exfoliation that a blade does so my skin doesn't feel as smooth as after I have shaved with a blade.  The convenience of this shaver will eventually overcome this but I did notice I wasn't feeling quite as smooth.  Because the weather is still cool, that isn't as much of an issue but later in the spring when I use self tanner, I'll want more exfoliation to keep the color longer.  I'll just have to exfoliate my legs other ways.

I should point out that my leg and under arm hair is fairly light in color and texture.  I waxed my legs for years and the hair never grew back as thick or dark as it had been.  And my under arm hair seems to have gotten lighter as I have aged as well.",1459900800,2016-04-06

This is a moisturizing sunscreen and seems thick enough I would only use a really light moisturizer underneath it. It doesn't smell rancid as so many sunscreen creams to do me, and it goes on nicely and sinks in well without too oily of a feel. You can feel it is there but it is not as heavy as Neutrogena for example.

I really like this overall, but of course given the higher end price tag I would stick to using this on the face and neck/ chest and not on the rest of the body.",1532131200,2018-07-21
5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

5.0,"A while back, frustrated by razor burn and ingrown hairs, I took to the internet to find a solution. I had a heavy beard, with skin that was dry and sensitive. I hated shaving, my face was read, burning and bleeding when I was done shaving, and I couldn't use an expensive blade for more than a week. One thing I was introduced to was wetshaving. Wetshaving can best be described as ""old time"" shaving. Wetshaving is far superior to the shaving technique that most men use today, and has greatly improved my shaving experience, and I don't dread shaving like I used to.

Wetshaving soon became the search for the perfect shave. Trying to get a balance between a smooth well groomed face, and no irritation. In fact, as many can attest, it soon became an obsession. Over the last few years I have tried dozens of different razors, shaving creams,  pre-shave oils,shaving bowls, badger brushes, aftershave balms and lotions, to find the perfect shave. I have bought everything from the highest end shaving creams at thirty or forty dollars a jar, to five dollar shave soaps. Having said all of that, Proraso is my favorite cream of all. It is an Italian produced cream that is very well respected by those who are ""shaving gourmets.""

The one thing that you must know about Proraso is it has menthol, and eucalyptus, and lots of it. It has been described as having a cooling or even bracing sensation, so much so that some guys don't like to use it in the winter. It also has a very strong and unique smell. Some say it smells medicinal, I think it smells like an Italian sewer to be honest. So why do I think it is the best cream? Well, 1st it is a great value for the money. While it may look expensive, when using a brush, you only need an almond sized amount in your bowl for a clean shave. So a tube will last you 3 months easy. It is essentially no more expensive than the dried out gunk they sell in aerosol cans at your local drugstore and yet it performs as well as something 3x's the price. Second, it produces a rich lather that has a slickness to it, which I believe is one of the most important parts of a good shave. A slick shaving cream means less drag from the razor. Third, it is great for guys like me who have thick beards. Some prefer a lighter lather, but I have found that with a thick beard you need all the protection you can get. Fourth, it comes in a tube, which I prefer to a shaving soap (soaps dry out my face) and to tubs. I travel a lot and I find it easier to travel with a tube then with a tub, just fits in my Dop bag better for some reason. Also, I have found that creams you get in a tube (and Proraso especially) can still give you a good shave without a brush. Some other brands say they will give you a good shave with or without a brush, but not true in my experience. I don't take my brush with me when I travel, and the fact that I can still get a good lather while traveling is a big plus. Fifth, I like the cooling (bracing effect) that I described earlier. If you are like me and ingrown hairs and razor burn are your main worries, washing off your face with cold water after you shave is nice, kind of like putting an ice pack on an inflamed knee, it dulls the irritation. Finally, it works great with the other products in the line. I have never liked pre-shave oils because, while they do protect the face, they make it harder to apply shaving cream and gunk up your razor. However, with the Proraso preshave it is different. It is not an oil, but a paste, so it seems to come off easier (however, take it easy with the preshave, put on too much and it will actually produce a burning sensation from all the menthol). Also, I really like the Proraso aftershave, not too thick not too thin. Put them all together and you can get a very good shave. If you don't want to spend the money on the Proraso aftershave, the Nivea Sensitive Balm is great too and half the price and available at most drug stores.

One thing that I must mention is that Proraso is sold in America as Bigelow Shaving Cream. When I bought a bottle from here I was disapointed that when it arrived from the seller (LCI) it was damaged and unusable. I use amazon for the convenience, I don't have time to box stuff up and ship it back.  So I went to the store that carries this product, and found that they had a buy 2 get 1 free sale. So I tossed this one, and just got 3 of the Bigelow creams (exact same ingredients) for 20 bucks plus tax. Now I am set for the next few months.",1361145600,2013-02-18

5.0,"There is no cosmetics company as underrated as Japonesque. I've owned their blush and finishing powder, and they are easily as good as many other prestige, high end brands.

Their new Kumadori line of brushes are simply superb. They're made to continue the makeup traditions of kabuki theatre, and in so doing, easily compete with many much more expensive Japonese brush lines.

The blending brush is really a do-it-all appliance. The rubberized handle is comfortable in the hand, and the dark, soft natural hair bristles are dense, but not so dense you can't use it for pretty much every powder face product you own. Hold it perpendicular to the face, and you are buffing in powder foundation. Til it to the side, and you can apply and sweep off excess finishing powder. Turn it on its edge, and you have a great contour or blush brush.

I have a lot of brushes, but this beats them all. I'm definitely making the small investment in other Japonesque brushes, because using them is such a freaking pleasure!",1457568000,2016-03-10

Jouer Anti-Aging Moisture Primer is a ""Hyaluronic Antioxidant Treatment with Peptides"" and claims to be a ""rich, hydrating primer formulated with clinically proven Matrixyl 3000, containing a blend of peptides, (which) helps restore elasticity and diminishes fine lines and wrinkles.

In addition it boasts properties such as being ""oil free, hypoallergenic, paraben free, silicone free, fragrance free, and dermatologist tested.""

What caught my eye was the additive of Hyaluronic acid.  This acid is a substance that is normally produced by the body and is what gives skin its volume and fullness.  Therefore this product is a true wrinkle fighter!  My wife reports that she has experienced some ""plumping of skin"" and good moisturizing which serves to reduce wrinkles.  The skin does absorb the product readily and as such will serve as a makeup primer if needed.  My wife is happy with Jouer and claims that it is a beauty product of ""high quality.""

3.0,"In all ways this would be a great product.  Except for the packaging.  It doesn't make sense that it squeezing out of the paintbrush end.  This is just kinda messy and I think with time it will get sorta dried out as you have to push more product out through old dried out product.

The other problem is the color.  I am a brunette with light eyes and skin.  This color was much too yellow and dark for my skin.  But it was the perfect color for my dark blonde with light eyes friend.  Her skin has a natural golden glow to it and this was a perfect match, yep, I was a teensy bit jealous.

The eyelighter is just short of liquid and it blends well becoming nearly invisible when I used a small dab on the back of my hand (I got a lot of color on my arms and hands after spending a weekend at the beach).

There is no perfume in this product, definitely a bonus unless you prefer scented under eyes.

Also, my dry, delicate and easily irritated skin did not react to this product so I would say that it is pretty gentle and would be okay for use on all types of skin.

So, to sum up, here is what I didn't like about this product;

1.  Too dark a color with too much yellow.

2.  Bad package that could get messy after just a few applications.

What I liked;

1.  easy to blend, turns nearly invisible

4.0,"The BioDerma Atoderm shower oil is a product I really want to like. After all it purports to nourish the skin 39% more after a months worth of use. The consistency of the product is not oily like I thought it would be. Its more like any shower gel. BUT it does not produce much lather like your typical shower gel either if you simply use this directly in your skin. It does lather if you use it on a sponge or loofah. If you want to see immediate results for your dry skin, you will need to use the soap directly on your skin and you have to use quite a bit when compared to liquid soap or shower gels.
However, my skin does not feel dry after the shower. Ive used enough soaps (mass market as well as high-end artisanal soaps) to know what a cheaply made product would feel like on your skin. This shower oil is definitely not harsh on your skin nor does it strip the natural oils off your surface. I like the pleasant, mild scent - though Id rather they remove the parfum. There is no need for that at all. People will buy this to nourish their skin - so don't add fragrances just coz you have to.
The product makers state it can be used on faces of babies and children. I got some into my eye to test if it stings. It does. Not the harsh burning sensation of soaps, but this product still does sting. So use it on your kids if you must, but be aware to avoid getting this anywhere close to their eyes.
33 oz costs $20. But you will make quick work of the 33 oz. It will probably last for 33-35 days if you use it directly or double that time if you use it with a loofah. I will try it for 30 days - if it changes the way my skin feels then Id rate it 5 stars.
Right now it is only a 4 star product.",1525996800,2018-05-11

5.0,"I have been a makeup artist for some time and as a result have had access to some of the best makeup there is out there from time to time.  I have worked with high and low end products which thrill me and high and low end products which leave my wondering why they bothered.  This eye shadow duo is one of those that was an unexpected surprise- a good one.

WHAT IS COCONUTS AND CABANAS LIKE?
This shadow duo turned out to be much nicer than I anticipated.  The colors themselves are much nicer in person than the photo supplied with it online.  The case is very classy looking.  It snaps open nicely and shuts tightly as well.  There is a mirror on the top lid which is large and a HUGE plus.  The pans themselves are substantial in size, allowing for the brush to have great access to each color without overlapping to the other pan.

The colors themselves are stunning.  The light color is a beautiful rose gold color which has a slight shift to a champagne or lighter gold in certain light in certain directions.  The dark color is a lovely gold brown color which is very beautiful and although you might think that you have a zillion like it if you have a substantial makeup collection, chances are you don't have one just like it.  I was sure that I had this color, but in my entire collection, I could not find one exactly like it.  It is a beautiful golden brown color.  Most browns lean either cooler, or more reddish in hue.  I have a very large eye shadow collection and I have to say, I did not find any matches in any of the palettes, individual shadows or MAC pigments.  Believe me, if anyone would have one, I would.

HOW DOES THIS SHADOW DUO PERFORM?
One of my biggest beefs in recent years has been that the quality of eye shadow has not met performance expectations after years of velvety smooth and gorgeously pigmented eye shadows from companies over the years.  Many newer shadows are not as nice as some of the better shadows I have used over the years.

This duo is a beautiful duo, well matched.  The colors are vibrant, but go well with many color combinations of hair and skin tone- mostly leaning toward the warmer side of the spectrum.  The shadow applies smoothly and has a satin finish to it, although it borders on metallic for the light color.  The durability seems to be excellent as I got an entire day of wear out of it using a shadow base (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Too-Faced-Cosmetics-Shadow-Insurance-0-35-Ounce/dp/B0013CSGBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Too Faced Cosmetics, Shadow Insurance, 0.35 Ounce</a>)

Blendability is high and the two colors blend out well together for a smooth transition without looking muddy.  You can sheer this out nicely for a glowy look or use it layered for a more intense color if you like.

HOW WILL THIS PERFORM ON MATURE SKIN?
I tend to prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viseart-Eyeshadow-Palette-Neutral-Matte-01/dp/B01HP5DK5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viseart Eyeshadow Palette - Neutral Matte 01</a>&nbsp;for mature skin. (The price in that link is crazy and way above retail but at least you can see what I am referring to).  This is okay if you don't have a lot of crepe creases on your lids.  It could enhance those on some people.  All in all, however, it is nicer than a lot of shadows I have used on mature skin.  It should be used with a base, however.  I would say it is worth a try in most cases.

WHAT IS THIS SHADOW LIKE?
The closest family of eye shadow that I can compare this duo to is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LORAC-Unzipped-Gold-Shimmer-and-Matte-Eye-Shadow-Palette/dp/B00S5XNIS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LORAC Unzipped Gold Shimmer and Matte Eye Shadow Palette</a>.  The two colors in this duo are in the same color family, although none are a perfect match, so you can use them together if you like.

WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS EYE SHADOW DUO?
If you have strawberry blonde, gold brown, golden blonde, or auburn hair, this duo would most likely look very pretty on you.  Suntanned skin with highlights in hair from summer might push some people to be able to wear this easily in summer as well who might not normally be able to wear this warm of a palette the rest of the years.

THE BOTTOM LINE
This eye shadow duo is perfect for warm and bright warm palettes of people.  If you are cooler but have a tan, it might also do well in the summer, even though the rest of the year it might not flatter as well.  The two colors are great staples especially for summer, but even for the holidays if you happen to look good in them.  They blend well with other shadows, especially above mentioned palettes.  These shadows should be used with a primer and not on bare skin to avoid sensitive reactions.  With satin finish and intense pigmentation, the larger pan of these shadows should last quite some time for lots of great use.  They apply well with fingers, sponge applicators, or a brush and last through the day without having to re-apply..

I was pleasantly surprised by the nice quality of these shadows and give them five stars.  I will update should anything change in my experience in the future.",1467244800,2016-06-30
5.0,"Love this product.  Recommended by dermatologist.  Lightly tinted moisture w/ sunscreen eliminates need for moisturizer, foundation and sunscreen.  I prefer the original (which gives a sheen to face) vs. the matte - which does not.",1458259200,2016-03-18

5.0,"This review, for the Vichy multi-masking set, covers all the individual masks since the set includes little pots of each, plus Vichy micellar water.  Each piece comes wrapped in tissue paper inside an attractive tin.  But if you're looking to purchase one of the individual masks, skip to the mini-review below of the one you are considering.  Each component is high-quality and non-irritating -- at least for this sensitive skin woman.

Clay mask:  This mask is perhaps the closest to what Americans consider a facial mask.  The product is putty-gray and creamy, making it both easy to apply and visible so that you won't accidentally avoid any areas.  You let it dry for 3-5 minutes, then rinse off.  I felt it tightening my skin within a minute or so.  This is surprisingly easy to rinse off, something that doesn't always happen with clay masks, perhaps because it's not as thick as those others.  It makes my skin feel tight, smooth, and clean without drying.  You know those annoying clogged pores in your nose?  Gone.  5 Stars

Double Glow Peel Mask:  This mask is likely to be the most perplexing of the lot because it contains the words ""peel"" and ""mask"" next to each other, which generally means, in American parlance, that you will coat your face and literally peel off the product.  Not so.  It contains mild acids to peel in the first step of the process and fine volcanic rock to exfoliate in step two.  You apply to your face, let dry for five minutes (peel) and rub the dried product in a circular motion (exfoliate), then rinse off.  Like the clay mask, I felt my skin tightening as the mask dried.  The exfoliating volcanic rock feels scarce, though, and I'm not sure the few grains are enough to truly exfoliate.  Plus, unlike most Vichy products, this one contains dimethicone (silicone.)  That said, my face feels and looks fresh afterward, so it must do something good to my skin.  4 Stars

Quenching Mineral Mask:  This mask is designed to deliver extra moisture to your skin.  It is a no-rinse product that begins as a mask, then gets rubbed into your face after five minutes of sitting on the surface.  I like it as a summer moisturizer since it doesn't leave any oils behind.  I'm not sure it will be strong enough when my skin dries more in the winter.  Regardless, my skin feels supple and fresh afterward.

Vichy Micellar Water:  I can't say enough about this fine product.  It's a no-rinse cleanser that feels like a gentle astringent.  It cleans without drying or irritation.  I use this every day, and I use it before moisturizing, after athletic activity, and for a quick mid-day refreshing.  It removes makeup and dirt, often with a single pass.  Although the masks did not instruct me to clean my face before applying them, I use this micellar water or my usual face wash before applying them.

Vichy makes great facial care products, and these masks are no exception.  As long as you understand what they are, you won't be disappointed.

3.0,"Dr. Brandt needles no more is supposed to decrease wrinkles.  I have tried similar products over the years and most have a very modest effect that is temporary.  While I don't have a whole lot of wrinkles on my face I do have some fine lines that noticeable as well as one deep crease.  The Dr. Brandt was easy to apply and had a very nice fragrance.  It left a slight tingling sensation that went away after a few minutes.  Over the course of a week I did notice a slight improvement just like I did with some of the other products I have used.  These products all seem to have moisturizers and other ingredients that relax the skin and make the wrinkles less pronounced.  The problem is that once you stop using the product the wrinkles will come back.  Considering the mild effect and the high price, not to mention the extremely small quantity (only .5 oz) I can only give this 3 stars.",1430784000,2015-05-05

5.0,"I obtained Obagi Foaming Gel at the same time as Obagi Nu-Dern Toner and  Serum and began to use them all at once and at the same time.  I saw incredible results after one use and this has continued since then.  My face looks years younger, cleaner and better toned.

No, this is not a paid commercial.  I am a no-nonsense New Yorker, beholding to only the truth.

The foaming gel cleanses quickly, thoroughly.  It has a pleasant aroma and you only need to use a little at a time.  The toner is not very strong.  The fact that no dirt comes off is a tribute to the foaming gel.  Other toners I have used are really astringents and feel like they have stripped your face of its natural oils.
The serum goes on easily and quickly.  I place a few drops in the cup of my hand and put it on my face.  Honestly, I don't know what it does, but my face is smoother, with no pores showing.  My makeup goes on more easily and stays on longer.

These products are not cheap, but I feel like I look five years younger, and my friends have noticed a difference.  Despite the cost, I believe I will purchase them when I have finished
I rate each of them a five.",1486512000,2017-02-08

Like other Crabtree and Evelyn products, the floral scent is perfected to be both subtle and long lasting at the same time. This is excellent as a daily moisturizer but its not thick enough, in my opinion, to work well on really dry places like heels or elbows. But its good for everything else, especially hands.

This lotion actually made my dry winter hands look so much better.

Its a large bottle (with a pump) so it will last a good long time.

5.0,"I first balked at the cost of this product but was fortunate to be able to try it.  Normally we never spend this amount on what i socmmonly known as lip gloss.  We were pleasantly surprised.

The lacquer itself is much thicker and deeply colored than anything we have tried before.  The viscosity allows for precise application and the brush is likely the best I have ever used.  The product provides a matte finish as opposed to shiny gloss and does not harden when dried.  Somehow, it seems to remain moist while not coming off easily.  There is very litle smeel associated with the product- best described as slightly sweet.  In our use (3 girls tested the product), we all agreed the prodcut stayed applied for hours and did not lose intensity of color.

NOTE ON COLOR SWATCHES IN PRODUCT INFORMATION:  As a photographer, it is important for me to point out that it is very difficult to match exact shades of the product you are looking for through a computer monitor.  The vast majority of computer monitors do not display colors accurately, particualrly different shades of the same color unless your monitor is capable and color calibrated.  Even then, unless the manufacturer created a white balanced and color balanced image and exported it perfectly, there will still be a variance.  In short, you may want to visit a local store that has the hardcopy color swatches.",1415232000,2014-11-06

3.0,"This spray is fair.  It does have some hold, which is good because my hair is resistant to holding products.  It also does a decent job of protecting my hair from heated styling tools.  However, Redken Iron Shape 11 or Hot Sets 22 works better than this product.  Iron Shape allows natural movement and has great hold all while providing thermal protection and adding shine.  My hair never gets stiff, sticky or crunchy and it looks like hair, not like pageant hair or helmet head.  Hot Off The Press tends to flake and will definitely get stiff if you over spray it.  Iron Shape never does that and my waves last several days.  Hot Sets 22 has twice the hold of Iron Shape and is great if you use hot rollers and want your curls to last for a couple of days at least.  For someone with hard to hold hair like mine, these two Redken products are a godsend.  I don't know why I decided I needed to try Hot Off The Press, I guess I was curious and was encouraged by all the positive reviews.  Don't get me wrong it's a decent product but these two Redken products are much better.  I apply Iron Shape liberally to clean damp hair and then let it air dry overnight.  In the morning, it's not stiff or sticky and I can easily get a brush through it.  I then use a curling iron to create loose waves.  I run a brush through the curls just once and they spring back into shape immediately and last several days.  If I need to recurl, I simply spray some additional Iron Shape, which doesn't build up or have any residue. I can't do that with Hot Off The Press.  I am returning HOTP to Ulta and exchanging it for more Iron Shape.  I was using Living Proof No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray but discovered Iron Shape during my search for a less expensive dupe.  Iron Shape is half the price of LP and provides thermal protection whereas LP does not.  Iron Shape also adds a nice sheen that doesn't look at all greasy or oily.  As far as I'm concerned Iron Shape is a perfect product.  If you want thermal protection with hold, then Iron Shape is the product for you.  There were too many things about HOTP that I didn't like and nothing not to like with Iron Shape, it even smells amazing.  I don't recommend Hot Off The Press at all.  But Iron Shape is the bomb!",1450051200,2015-12-14

First thoughts - IT WAS SO EASY.

My hair is thick and it usually takes a good fifteen to thirty minutes to flatten, curl, tame my hair. It leans to the body/frizzy side of the spectrum, so I like to flatten it, if I'm going out for something special I will curl it.

I ran this baby through my hair and did some quick flips and tugs and I had hair with a bit of body, which was sleek but not flat to my head, which is what flat irons usually do to my hair.

Again my hair is thick, very thick actually, but fine. Worked fine for me. All I had to do was run it through my hair and turn it in a C for the ends to have a bit of curl.

I've got to say, I really like both products. The eye cream goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin really quickly.

4.0,"Dermablend makeup has been around for a long time, and I have tried various forms of their makeup over the years.

Whether it's from blemishes, or discolorations due to broken blood vessels or various other ailments or just natural aging, their makeup has long been regarded as the best  to coverup and conceal. The price for that however is that they also can feel heavier than many other makeups.

Saying that, this Dermablend Intense Powder Camo makeup is no exception. I really like it a lot, and it's great to use after you put on a concealer or just by itself. It's just that as you get older, watch out that although these powders can cover discolorations,  they can also make us look older.

The biggest problem with buying makeup online is that you really need to try them on in person, in the right light to get the right shade. I hate to see negative reviews when the problem is that the person just bought the wrong shade. And it's really almost impossible to get the right shade online.

Saying that, I am light-skinned with dark hair and I would describe my skin as being more olive toned. I am reviewing this powder in Sand 30N and the color is just a bit too dark for me- almost what I would look like if I had a tan.

4.0,"At the outset, I suggest looking at the numerous videos on YouTube or at FHI's website (search for FHI Stylus or FHIBrands dot com) for pointers on how to use this styling brush.  This styling brush does a lot of things well, and some things not quite as well.  If you are looking for big waves and flattening or controlling small sections of hair, this tool is great.  If you are looking for a straightener for lots of hair or a curling iron to make tight curls, other tools will probably work better.  However, if you are looking for a single tool that will do just about everything except for small tight curls, this tool is the one to get.

For big waves and big curls, this device is great.  The brush is light and the temperature settings are easy to use.  The settings are approximate for each type of hair.  The easiest way to figure out the temperature to use is to start with a setting lower than you think you need, and see how well that temperature works.  Overheating hair is generally not a good idea, and can damage hair, so easing into a temperature setting from the low side is better than going past the optimal temperature.

The brush heats up quickly.  Most of the ceramic areas heater areas have bristles to minimize the chance of burning hands and fingers, but the edges of the brush can get warm.  I am always careful around heated styling tools, though the hottest areas on this brush are difficult to reach.

Use the brush on a section of hair at a time.  The size of the section matters and changes the ultimate effect.  Experiment with different size sections and different curling techniques (wrapping the hair clockwise or counterclockwise, wrapping hair around the brush completely vs. a sweeping brush stroke, etc.) to see how your hair reacts.  Also consider using a spray to help hold the curls.  You can use this styling brush as a straightener, but a dedicated straightener might be simpler to use, though the temperature control on this brush is better than many, and probably most straighteners.

This styling brush has lots of other features, including a no-slip handle, and textured edge areas to help slide through hair.  The brush powers off automatically after an hour for safety.  The brush comes with a thermal bag to permit transporting an iron shortly after use, so you can throw this brush in a suitcase without waiting for it to cool completely.

As a single all-purpose styling tool, this particular tool does most things well and easily replaces up to three different tools.  The tool is light weight and easy to handle.  The tool looks good too.  Though it would be unusual to impress friends with a styling tool, it might be possible with this one.

5.0,"My gold-standard test for sunscreens is to wear them while walking dogs in the super humid morning. If my sweat doesn't cause them to collect in the creases on my neck (yeah, ouch!), they must be staying in place. My favorite for my face is COTZ for Faces, which I believe is made my the same company as this, but it can be a bit too matte/dry-looking, and the titanium dioxide makes it look too obvious, too much like makeup for my neck and chest. This did not collect in my neck creases or eyelid creases, did not sting, and was invisible on my medium-toned white skin. It was dewy-looking--not greasy, rather than matte, which I find more appealing, especially on my drier-skinned neck. A win!
It's a bit thicker and more water-resistant than the Drunk Elephant Umbra lotion, which is also 20% zinc oxide, if you are curious. I think it's about the same degree of moisturizing.",1501977600,2017-08-06

3.0,"First off, when I requested this from Vine I thought it was a facial moisturizer, which is not its intended purpose. I have tried it on the face for when I'm feeling winter-dry flaky skin and it does work well, but the product is very thick and you'd have to wait some time for it all to sink in before applying makeup. As a night cream? Again might work, but the scent is so strong I wouldn't be able to apply it and stick my head right into a pillow and smelling it all night. Yes, the scent does dissipate, but not immediately.

As a body moisturizer? I liked it a lot, despite the thickness of the cream (apply lightly and then add more if you like). It does help with the winter-dry flakiness, and right after applying I could pour water on my skin and it repelled it - a good thing for those out in the great outdoors. As for the sunscreen aspects? It's November in Seattle and we've not much sunshine these days, so I can't test it or comment on that aspect of the product at this time.

All in all a good moisturizer, except for the strong scent. I am sensitive to perfumes and aftershaves and other strongly scented things, so that is a deal-breaker for me and thus the lower rating. Your mileage may vary.",1416614400,2014-11-22

There is no sudsing, get that -- no lather, just massage the white cream into your scalp and locks, let it rest, then rinse.

4.0,"This makeup feels weird.  If I were rich I might buy it just to poke it with my finger.  It's kind of fun that way.  It reminds me of a cold gel shoe insert- it is VERY different.
It actually is a seaweed based product so it is mostly water with the pigment suspended in it.  This is the most natural looking makeup I've ever worn.
  The color is great.  I used Bisque # 5 on my fair skin.  Usually I would go for an ivory but the bisque is what was offered.  It works great - I suspect it will indeed work well over a variety of skin tones in the light to medium range because it is so very translucent.
  I am aging and have some fine lines when I first wake up, and this does not do a thing for them.  IN fact, it maybe makes them look a bit worse.  I think this product would be better on younger women.  It is non-comeodogenic, and hypoallergenic, fragrance free and - I like this one - CRUELTY FREE.
  It is made in Japan.

  The product comes in a container that looks a bit inexpensive at first glance, but when I consider it carefully, it is a container that is designed to keep the product very moist.  The container locks to a seal and has a pad at the top to help keep the moisture IN the container.

  STUPID ME did not know how to go about using it.  I did not read the ample instructions that came with it.  That's just my style.  So I sat there poking this weird feeling makeup, giggling, until I poked a hole right in the top of it.  I later found out that was a no-no, but other than making it look ugly sitting in the container, the makeup is still working fine.

  I've put this on with my fingers, a Bobbi Brown stippling brush, and a sponge.  Of all the methods I've used, I like putting this particular one on with my fingers best.  Besides the strange poking addiction I have with it, I actually found that using my fingers give me a very, very nice finish with this product.  There's never a line of demarcation - it just blends right in.  I don't need powder either.  It's just very natural, with great coverage that is really amazing considering how little pigment is actually going on your face.  It's very unusual makeup.  It covers REDNESS like a dream!

I developed some shine but only after about 4 hours.  This makeup lasts on me as long as the Vincent Longo blush does - about 14 hours in cold weather.  That's all I've got to test it in, it will be interesting to see how it will do in Georgia's hot, humid summers.

I'm only giving it 4 stars though because it doesn't do much to hide fine lines.  My face is fairly smooth but I do have those lines, and this product seems to settle in to them a bit and does nothing.  It might be better with primer but I did not test this with it, so I can't say.  I did use moisturizer under the product.  If your skin looks smooth and young, this foundation should even up your skin tone and make you look fabulous.  If discoloration and making your tone more even aren't your only concerns, you might want to try something else.",1391299200,2014-02-02

3.0,"This oil and emulsifier based cleanser removes all traces of makeup and does not leave skin feeling stripped.  It is an impressive makeup remover.

I have issues with the aesthetics, though.  The first time I used it, I kept wondering when it would start to foam because it felt like I was still rubbing oil and water on my skin.  I finally opened my eyes and glanced in the mirror to find it was indeed foaming.  I can't feel it changing on my face or with my fingertips.  I've used it a good two weeks now, and that hasn't changed.  I know that after I add water, it will start foaming, but I can't tell when that happens.  It is impossible to rinse off unless I use a washcloth.  I can see the makeup is gone, but water beads up on my face.  I appreciate the softness, but I really don't like leaving cleanser on my face, so I scrape it off with a wash cloth.

Yesterday, I noticed the ""Safe For"" symbol on the back of the bottle.  This symbol looks like a jar, and has a number followed by the letter ""M"".  This symbol is not on all cosmetic and personal care consumables, but I find it more and more often.  Unfortunately, according to the ""Safe For"" symbol on this bottle, the cleanser is safe to use for a mere three months after opening.  I think the average consumer will wind up wasting a lot of product.  Exceptions would be multi-user households.",1428537600,2015-04-09
4.0,"I thought the packaging if very unique when I opened it.  I quickly learned you can slide them onto other products such as their mineral powder.  The color I received, blossom doesn't look at all like the picture.  It is more of a coral.  The color is actually pretty sheer which allows you to build the color onto your face for the perfect blushing bride look.  I have fairly light skin color, so when I dipped my blush brush into this I actually was surprised that it wan't as pigmented as it looked.  This is actually a good thing as this allows for you to build your color gradually.  This color will look fantastic when I get  a little color on my skin for the summer.

The price point is at the high end and comparable to other high end cosmetics.  This would be a brand I would consider again.",1398988800,2014-05-02

At that amount, the bottle really would last for a long time. Once on, it took a little while to absorb, but did eventually. I am not a big fan of the scent, it isn't awful, I just don't prefer it, although I rarely care about scent in the first place. After it was absorbed, my skin didn't feel oily, just hydrated, and it made my skin feel soft and smooth.

5.0,"Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program.
I like this scent, it's quite a timeless masculine scent with plenty of woody overtones a little oriental spice and some musk but not overpowering.
Fragrances are so subjective so it's difficult to recommend this for everyone, but from the point of view of everyday wear it seems to last well through the day and into the early evening, something some more expensive or well known fragrances do not.
Presence was launched in 2001 so it's been around a while, top notes are ginger, cinnamon, bergamot and cardamom; middle notes are apple, sage and heliotrope; base notes are teak wood, sandalwood, tonka bean, amber and white musk.
Nice mix of a fresh modern scent combined with some classic tones that lasts.

4.0,"I was pleased with this skin care set, but not in love with it because it is tuned to a younger man's skin (in general). I believe this to be the case because the three products seem to reduce the amount of skin oil on my face a lot, which is not so necessary now that I am on the doorstep of ""geezerdom"" (59 years). I can see I am about ten to fifteen years past this product and probably should start thinking about ""dry skin"" formations instead of ""normal"". Looking at each product in the set:

The wash: This comes in a nice, practical plastic pump bottle. I found I only needed a single pump or less to wash my face very thoroughly. What scent there is reminds me of the old PhisoHex product from many years ago. It is non-greasy or oily and left my skin clean and dry feeling; ready for the next step.

The herbal toner: The toner comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip top cap. The scent is a light herbal. It is a thin, clear liquid that is easily applied using a cotton ball or pad. Since my wife keeps a good stock of cotton cosmetic pads in our bathroom, I used those. Scrubbing these around my face seemed to remove a good amount of dead skin cells and other debris that the wash didn't take off.

The moisturizer: Once again, the product is pretty neutral in its scent, which I found to be good for me. In fact, none of the three products is very perfumey, which is a plus for most men. In any case, the moisturizer is non-greasy or oily. This is nice at first, but I found that it seemed to dry out after application to the point that I felt like I could use more on my skin. So, I put on more and found that this would essentially evaporate or go away completely, too. As a geezer, I think I need to have a bit more residual help. So, I've ended up going back to Cetaphil lotion to put a thin cover over the top of the Baxter moisturizer.

Conclusion:
This hits a lot of things right for men.
It is not heavily perfumed
It comes in bottles and a tube that are practical in size, shape and use.
It works.

The only reason I took off a star was because of the need for a bit more emollient action for me in the moisturizer, and that is likely because I'm a geezer. If you have oily skin, this is not going to be an issue for you and it is possibly a five for that application.",1390435200,2014-01-23

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

5.0,"I've become a huge fan of this brand despite the fact it's not organic. It is paraben free which is a step in the right direction but I really wish the company would continue to offer alternatives with fewer chemicals. Now, having said that, Vichy works great, it's soothing and has never irritated my admittedly sensitive skin. The fragrance is always pleasant but not overpowering and this set is no exception. First, this comes in a tin metal box decorated with splashes of colorful rhinestones making this perfect for gift-giving. The overall presentation is quite nice from the outside. Now, inside wasn't quite up to par - instead of having form molded insert to hold and highlight the three piece set, each was wrapped in tissue paper with a bit more to hold things in place. Not very attractive and somewhat a disappointment after the decorated exterior. Inside, the three piece set is listed as trial size and should be kept in mind as these are smaller than average...but not too small. The amounts are still ample for quite a bit of use making this a wonderful way to try it out for a month or so without having to spend a small fortune on full size quantities. I find Vichy to be one of the most consistent brands available today.",1494979200,2017-05-17

3.0,"I have NC15, adult, oily, acne prone skin. The Ivory color was an ok match, though this brand tends to be tricky when it comes to choosing the right shade. Later in the day, it can appear slightly yellow. That's a problem for me, because it wear only concealer and powder, so it needs to be a near perfect match for my skin color.

This concealer does offer medium coverage. When used under the eyes, though, it creases, And when used on blemishes, I have to layer it a little to make it stick. Patting with fingers is probably the best way to apply it, but it slides off your face If you pat too much. Layering more than one swipe can make it appear cakey, and it separates later in the day, even with a setting powder.

The thickness and oiliness of this product makes me wary, since these types of stick concealers tend to make breakouts worse. But I didn't experience any adverse reactions or immediate breakouts.

Overall, for the price this isn't a truly unique product. I couldn't find a good use for it, or a good way to apply it, and it even looked oily in the package. It offers more coverage than most drugstore stick concealers, but for the money you could get 2-3 liquid concealers at the drugstore that would perform better. Not the greatest, and not the worst product. Just not worth $22.",1404777600,2014-07-08
4.0,"This is a nice compact, it's attractive and solidly built.  I really like the eyeshadows as they blend beautifully.  I found the large pan of black eyeliner to be especially nice.  It might be black shadow, but I used it as eyeliner with the small end of the brush and it was really easy to work with.

The shadows seem long wearing.  The blush was very natural looking.

The lip glosses were fine.  I'm not a big fan of lip gloss, so my opinion probably shouldn't count on that.

The pans remove from the compact very easily (I just stuck a 00 knitting needle in the hole, but I think a paperclip or pin would work just as well).  The pans appear to be held by magnets.

Downsides:
The brush doesn't fit in the compact!  I think this is just absurd.  there isn't even a carrying case for the brush, so don't even think of putting this in your purse for an evening out.

You can't find replacement pans of eyeshadow.  I want to throw out the gloss (not because it's bad, but because I don't like gloss) and replace that with two more eye shadows, but I can't find replacement pans anywhere - not on Amazon and not on Michelle Phan's site.",1416787200,2014-11-24
1.0,"A lot of money for what? I have never spent $75.00 for any beauty product. I liked the idea of this product. When this came, it came in a box with six vials and six packages of 2 moon shaped pads. The pads are really big. They go from the corner of my eyes to my hairline. The vials have lots of liquid. So no worries of not having enough. However once you put the liquid on the pads, the real fun begins. Trying to apply the soaked pads is a real messy job. They are so thin and with the liquid they do not hold their shape. So you have to pat the pads to get them to stay so that you do not tear them apart. Also too much handling makes them turn to glue.

Next time I think I will apply a little bit of the liquid and then use a q tip to apply the rest of the liquid so that I can control how much I need or it just runs down my face. Plus, I doubt I will see any effects from using this.",1415404800,2014-11-08

I'm only applying it to small areas at a time due to my skin being very sensitive but aside from the burning it's not too bad.

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17
5.0,"In case you all took a different language requirement in school, ""Jouer"" is French for ""to play"".

I like this name for this company, and find it appropriate. There has been a lovely playful vibe to every one of their products which I have been fortunate enough to try, so far.
However, quality wise, Jouer doesn't kid around. It makes good make up! How do I know? Because I prefer to use good make up and recognize it. I am hip to makeup which is first rate, I like to think.

 It is so great to see what effects you can achieve with this particular product, Jouer Luminizing Moisture Tint in Golden. It is a bit like a BB cream, a bit like a foundation, but if you are a makeup lover, you will see, as I did, that it is actually so much more than only that.

I took my shower this morning and primed to try this out only with a very simple moisturizer. I really wanted to start from the ground up to see how this performed. However, I didn't want to use this as the ""base moisturizer"", as I am extremely fair skinned.  I decided that it would be too strong a tint if I chose to use it as moisturizer base alone.  So I focused on its feature as a luminizing tint.

I was correct in guessing that I would need to start with plain old moisture first. The reason I say this is that when I applied the Jouer luminizing tint in Golden I saw such a difference in my face it was a bit of an overkill. However, after I took a cloth and patted some of it away a bit, the effect was stunning!

So what I am saying is this:

Definitely try this if you love makeup and like looking pretty...just don't overdo it if you have fair skin.

I am also adding that I especially like the gorgeous ""blending aspect"" which Jouer Luminizing Moisture Tint in Golden has, even if I did overdo the applying the first time and had to pat some away.
Your face will look like you do not have a single wrinkle or a blotch. That alone is something I rarely say, especially when I am talking about myself and my face.

So I do encourage you to try this. I love it!

Effectively, I just needed to go easy on the application and use a light hand, I repeat. I started from the neck up and covered my whole face with the tint by gently applying it with my fingers and palms after rubbing my hands together when I had put what I originally thought would be the right amount on one of my palms.
So far it has lasted all day!

I am going to be attending a school reunion in a few weeks, and my Jouer is coming as MY escort. Why? Because it makes me look that good, now that I have figured out how to use it. ;)

I am ""enchantee"" with Jouer!  You will be enchanted with Jouer as well, I bet!
I do hope you like it as much as I do! It is a great boost for a fresh spring and summer look, alone and/or with other added makeup you might want to try when you are in the mood to look totally drop dead gorgeous!

Thanks,

jean

Note:
The way I applied it, after a steamy shower, and by using that other moisturizer first, did cause a bit of a stinging sensation. This stinging feeling dissipated rapidly.  I think my pores were really open from the shower and my whole face was a bit sensitive. The next time I apply Jouer Luminizing Moisture Tint I am going to prep a different way, washing my face thoroughly but ending with cool water, then using a light oil or serum, and then applying the Jouer Tint. I think this will solve the stinging problem which I believe I caused myself by jumping in too enthusiastically!",1400544000,2014-05-20
3.0,"This is gentle, but a lot thinner than I expected, making it easy to waste a lot per use, which, given the price tag, is less than ideal. It has two ingredients, that separate when still, so must be briskly shaken before use.

I used a soaked cotton ball and it did take off my waterproof mascara pretty cleanly, though it took 2-3 cotton balls to get it all off both eyes, which took a good 1/2"" out of the bottle ... Making daily use a fairly pricey prospect given the cost of this. Most other eye makeup removers I've tried are oilier, requiring less product per use. I will note, though, that it's quite gentle. I wear contacts and didn't take them out before using this, and had no issues. I only occasionally wear waterproof mascara or, heck, mascara at all, so this serves my needs fine for occasional use, and does a better job at complete removal than my useful Ponds.

Again, my only real issue is the very high price point.",1488412800,2017-03-02

5.0,"I love this.  So does my wife. Truly. 1.0 fl oz (30 ml) in an attractive heavy square glass bottle with a spray head.  Marketed as ""unisex"" and I easily agree.  Nicely presented in a 2 layer box with outer sleeve.  Now, the scent . . .

My very,very first impression was that it reminded me of the Asian after shaves my dad wore . . . Jade East, or Hai Karate (young people will not know those once popular names).  After settling in the scent mellowed and deepened.  Certainly a presence of citrus (contains grapefruit essence), but underlying fragrances of spices (contains black pepper) and woods (contains cedar wood and patchouli).  I put a little on my wrist, which I keep checking as I type this.  Just heavenly!  And the scent is not wearing off, implying use of high quality base oils.  This ""Raw Spirit Bijou Vert (green jewel)"" will join my short list of favorite perfume/colognes.

I already mentioned, ""unisex"".  Yes, that applies here.  I asked my wife to describe it - she replied, ""Definitely not flowery, maybe some citrus"".  I think I did well in my description above.  As a man, I'd be pleased to wear this on dressy occasions.  I may not get the chance, as my wife seems to have taken it over -- she just loves it.

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

3.0,"Who hasn't seen Cindy Crawford's infomercials touting her beauty line?  Skin products with extracts of that super French melon, full of antioxidants known as superoxide dismatase (SOD [not as in ""off""]).  It's a *French* melon, folks, and we all know that's got to be good.  After all, didn't the French invent that perennial favorite, the French kiss?

Anyhoo, this serum contains three powerful anti-aging ingredients:  1) that melon complex already mentioned, 2) peptides, and 3) hyaluronic acid.  It's supposed to protect your skin, increase hydration and prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

So I've been using this for about three weeks and must admit that I like the way it makes my skin feel.  It's cooling as it goes on, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky and not at all sticky.  It may even refine the pores a bit.  Not only that but the little bottle is really pretty with those multi-color swirls of creme.

And what's not to like?

1)  The huge number of polysyllabic ingredients.  I've counted more than 50 in the list and that super melon extract is #12.

2)  The cost.  There is only one ounce of serum in this container.  This price for one ounce is exorbitant, especially considering I can get and have gotten very similar results on my skin with any hyaluronic acid serum at a much lower price.

Bottom line for me is that although this works well I'll never buy it.  Too costly and too many unnecessary ingredients.

5.0,"WOW is all I have to say about this mascara!

It's tough for me to find one that meets my criteria for mascara, actually I don't know that I have before this one in fact.  My criteria is that it a) doesn't melt off my face as soon as applying, I want it ON my lashes, not below my eyeballs.  b) doesn't make my eyes itch (my eyes are sensitive) c) makes my eyelashes look good.  While I realize that isn't a huge list it's really hard to find one that meets all three.  If it doesn't make my eyes itch, then it seems to melt off.  If it doesn't melt off, it makes my eyes itch or they just don't do anything and so forth.

The bonus to Butter London's Iconoclast is that the brush is really amazing.  It's a normal plastic brush for most of the wand but the end tip is a ball that lets you get in there to grasp the tiny lashes that can be troublesome to nab.

Personally I don't think there's mega volume but I think that it does build up decently.

There was a bit of fallout BUT it wasn't until about 12 hours in of my wearing on a 100 degree day when photographing a wedding.  That's really impressive considering how many times I put my eyes up to a camera through the day.

My thoughts: it conceals very well under the eyes, as it seems to contain a bit of that yellow-y pigment that works so well for under eye concealers; it does feel a bit greasy, and it's not at the top of my list of favorite overall concealers (there are some great options out there in the same price range), I would certainly use it as I dabbed a small amount under my eyes and on a blemish, it blended well, stayed all day and did not cake up: I covered it with a bit of mineral powder, which seemed to also blend fairly smoothly: all in all, I like it fine.",1407974400,2014-08-14

3.0,"First, I love the fact that this moisturizer is made with certified organic ingredients. Considering the fact that so many cosmetics are made with harmful chemicals, it's good to know that Juice Beauty provides a viable alternative. While their products may not fit my skin type completely, I'm glad that their high quality ingredients ensures that they won't do too much harm, either.

I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but unfortunately it feels just too thick and pasty for my taste. It comes in a nice frosted glass jar and has a consistency not unlike sour cream. Because it feels so thick, I used it sparingly on my face and neck. Fortunately, my skin absorbed it quickly and it doesn't leave too much of a residue. The fragrance is so mild as to be almost not there, which I don't mind (I shy away from anything too strong-smelling).

It's OK but I have many different types of moisturizer and nothing about this one stood out. Yes, my skin was a little softer, but no better or worse than other products I've used, like Neutrogena, Aveda, Burt's Bees and L'Occitane.  I think this product would be best for those who are have highly sensitive skin and break out often to the use of artificial ingredients.

The price is a little high, and given its OK but not outstanding performance, I'll stick to my current AHAVA Dead Sea moisturizer. It would also help if it had some SPF built-in - that would influence me to use it more. As it is, I will use it mainly at night and on rainy days when a high SPF isn't necessary.",1414886400,2014-11-02

A small pump is all it takes and has a lasting moisturizing effect for me. I place a few dabs under each eye each morning and night. It is comfortable and cooling and lasts. It also seems to help my makeup go on better because my skin is more balanced and evenly moisturized. I also feel good that is paraben free.

The only sticking point is the price - it's one of those expensive products you might buy at a whim at Sephora, but there are lesser cost alternatives available that do just as a good a job.

I normally don't wear glitter polishes because they are a pain most I have used were always to thick or runny. This one was not a problem at all. So far it's holding up good ,no chipping.

Just don't slip when you apply it or else you'll have to remove everything and start over.

The blackest black is REALLY black, too dark for me but excellent for anyone looking for this color.  I really thought the colort would be okay; however, it's darker than my  mascara.

But overall I must say the lipstick did not cause any irritation and it was easy to apply. There is quite a bit more sweet smell than usual found in similar lipsticks. The ""London Color"" is little bit more bold red than I thought it would be thereby it cannot be applied for all occasions. This one might work well for one or two special parties one might attend wherein the Bold red would be appropriate. This color is not suitable for daily wear or for work places it is too flashy red in my opinion. Overall rating with 3 stars.",1482624000,2016-12-25

The application area felt dry but didn't peel or flake. Initially I did not notice any difference but after about a week and  a half, the skin seems more slightly more refined. I had no issues with the container. The product dispensed easily. The time release formula does appear to be more gentle than other retinol products but it takes time to see noticeable results. I do wish it were fragrance free though.",1485820800,2017-01-31
4.0,"I have somewhat sensitive skin and find many moisturizers to be irritating. I was pleased to discover that this product moisturizes effectively without the bothersome irritation. I also appreciate the fact that the lotion has almost no odor.

As for the mythical age reducing/anti-aging component: moisturized skin tends to look younger and this product is a very effective moisturizer. I have only been using the cream for a week or so, so can't really speak to this component too well. If at any point I notice that the clock has stopped (or reversed!) I will update this review. (From years of experience; don't hold your breath.) Also, for heavens sake, use a more effective SPF with this moisturizer because 15 certainly isn't enough!

I do like the companies environmentally friendly approach to packaging, so the 3.5 stars I give the product (1 star off for SPF, .5 star off for price point) is rounded up to 4!

SPF 50 Defense Refresh Setting Mist, 0.1 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;so I was curious to try the bliss Get Set & Go Makeup Setting Spray and see how it would compare.

I don't tend to use makeup setting sprays everyday, but do rely on them when I really need my makeup look to last and know it could be exposed to adverse conditions (i.e. humidity), like weddings and other events or nights out.  Generally when I'm using a setting spray I'm considering whether it sprays a fine, even mist (seems to give more even coverage with less product and sets more quickly than those with large droplets), whether it actually succeeds at making my makeup last longer, and whether it causes skin irritation.  Based on those needs the UD All Nighter spray has been my holy grail to date.  Would the bliss compare?  I was curious to see.

Since the other sprays I've tried to date have been great, but not *quite* UD level I was pleased with how much I liked this spray.  It does seem to spray a pretty even and relatively fine mist, makes my makeup hold steady even in the face of heat and humidity, and it doesn't irritate my skin.  It also set pretty quickly and didn't feels sticky, heavy, or tacky to the touch.  I do feel like the UD might hold my makeup a bit more steady and a bit longer than this does, but because I'm clearly not doing scientific tests in a lab it's hard to 100% tell when it's close.

Reading other reviews, yes, the ingredients can read a little scary, but that seems to be par for the course with many of these sprays.  (It's basically like hair spray for your face, but without the stickiness.)  If you're seeking something more natural I'd go the route of setting your makeup with a hydrating toner like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fresh-Rose-Floral-Toner-250ml-8-4oz/dp/B00B5PDIK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fresh Rose Floral Toner 250ml/8.4oz</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurlique-Balancing-Mist-Rosewater-3-3-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B001MA7QLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurlique Balancing Mist, Rosewater, 3.3 Fluid Ounce</a>.  Having used those as well you're definitely not going to get the same results as with a dedicated setting spray, but it's helpful for those days when you want something liquid to set and may not want something as unnatural or heavy duty as a dedicated setting spray.

As for the size, this does seem a tad small for the price (at the time of writing you can get the UD 4.0 oz container for just a little bit more).  I personally prefer a smaller size as it's easier to tuck into my makeup bag and accordingly, often buy the travel sized version of setting sprays when they're available.  I have the 3.4 fl. oz version of the Super Goop! for example, but because the bottle is so long it doesn't easily fit into my makeup bag and I don't use it as often as I should.  But if the price per ounce matters to you, you'll definitely want to compare when buying.  As well as whether any of the additional benefits of some sprays matter to you (i.e. additional SPF, oil-control, hydration, etc.)

4.0,"I got this for my girlfriend to try out. She has very sensitive skin but was looking for a product to OCCASIONALLY (about once a week) provide a deeper cleaning of her face. She was careful to only use the ""sensitive"" brush on the lowest speed setting combined with a very mild, fragrance-free facial cleanser. We were pleasantly surprised at the results. She hasn't experienced any irritation after using the LumaRx brush four or five times over the past month, and her skin is smoother and her complexion is noticeably improved. As a man, when I actually notice an improvement on her face it must be doing something - because I'm usually completely clueless about such things.

The LumaRx brush is lightweight and comfortable to hold, and the controls are easy to activate. The unit is not overly loud, which is a blessing because you use it so close to your ears. The built in the timer to tell you when to switch sides, plus the auto shutoff after a  minute, was ideal in case she got distracted and didn't pay attention to how long she has been using the brush. The charge seems like it will last forever, especially since she's only using it once or twice a week. The nice looking carry bag is handy if you're traveling or don't want to leave the unit out on the vanity in-between uses.

I guess the only thing we didn't like about the LumaRx brush was the relatively high price. There are dozens of similar motorized facial cleansing brushes on the market to choose from for half the price of the LumaRx - though most of the less expensive ones require AA batteries. You have to decide for yourself if you think the features of the LumaRx are worth it. The unit definitely looks and feels ""upscale"" if that matters to you, and it did to my girlfriend, who in the end liked it enough to recommended the product.

The consistency is wonderful... it's a gel-like feel, so it glides onto the skin and looks very natural. I like that the spoolie is attached. I'm used to needing two hands to fill in my brows, and this makes it much more efficient.

Here's my problem - the dark blonde shade is WAY too dark! It's what I would use if I had medium brown hair. I compared it side-by-side with my cheap-o Cover Girl dark blonde pencils and they don't even look like they are in the same color family, let alone the same shade. I am fair-skinned with red hair and the blonde usually just fills in for me without darkening much.

3.0,"I purchased a few samples of Pureology shampoo+conditioner through the Amazon sampling program, as I was interested in trying Pureology products. I never tried this brand before and wanted to have at least a vague opinion on their products before buying the full size.

The `Strength Cure` line has over the top claims (in the end, just the scissors will `repair` damaged hair), but manages to provide decent shampoo and conditioner formulas. I somewhat felt my hair strengthened (they're the kind of product that give body to hair), I think that `velvety soft finish` is kind of a good description. But I have frizzy hair, and while it left it hydrated, I prefer shampoos/conditioners that help me with that as well.
The shampoo did a nice thick lather and cleaned my hair surprisingly well. Pureology shampoos (from which I tried) are not the kind that leave hair squeaky clean. I have sensitive scalp with a tendency to get dandruff, the shampoo didn't aggravated my itchiness.
The conditioner wasn't very thick and even my thin hair basically absorbed quickly everything. When I rinsed it off, I felt my hair very smooth, almost covered in a silicone like layer. Once dried, my hair was hydrated, but very frizzy, so I needed to follow with a leave-in conditioner.

Pureology usually has those aroma therapeutic scent blends that I just dislike, too strong, But the `Strength Cure` had a milder scent, a hint of herby lavender and honey; I personally also felt a bit of nettle in there. I really liked that the lavender scent was almost toned down, natural, some hair products have a strong artificial lavender scent.",1523491200,2018-04-12
3.0,"I ordered this product because of some irregularities on my face and discoloration near my eyes. I don't normally use much makeup, so I wanted a light textured, natural looking product. This product feels a bit heavy and goes on a bit less smoothly than other products I've used. I used my finger to fix that and it looked better. I am more used to a semilar cream with a more liquid texture.

As a concealer the Dermablend product works very well, and though it has a rather odd fragrance, it disappears pretty soon after the product is applied, so fragrance may not be a problem for those who are sensitive. The color was a bit darker than I expected but it blends fine with my skin tone anyway. The product comes in a small, easily transported container, and the one I received looked fresh and appealing.

So if this one really had a more appealing, almond fragrance, I would have given it a solid 5 stars. It's not offensive, and I am very sensitive to smells and chemicals, it doesn't really have that sweet almond fragrance that I expected, but it is so outstanding, creamy, absorbent at so effective at softening the skin that the slight disappointment in the fragrance, is easily overlooked. While it is an expensive product, it really spreads like silk, but absorbs like no other product I have ever used. It really is a 'concentrate' and I love that since it only requires only a scant amount.

It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19

Then break out your soap/cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try! If you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet.

I hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference!

Well, so far I am IN LOVE with Bioderma Atoderm Cream.  I use it straight out of the shower and my skin has NEVER been so hydrated.  It isn't too thick but it isn't super thin.  It is kind of like Eucerine but on the lighter side and non greasy.  My skin literally soaked this up and feels SO SOFT and ZERO irritation. I will definitely be keeping this one around.

4.0,"Foremost, I have to agree that the price is pretty steep. However, do know that if one uses the proper amount (i.e., not three or four pumps), then it should last a little while. So, if you are buying this for your child, just explain how using more of this cleanser will not work any better than using the needed amount.

For me, the smell is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. So, if this was a deterrent for you, I would suggest trying it. Everyone is different.

The product does a nice job of cleansing and has good rinse-ablilty.

When used as directed, the bottle should last a bit long than you might expect (it is a pretty small bottle for the price). Moreover, no one ever regrets adding more natural/organic/vegan/cruelty-free products to their regimen.",1418774400,2014-12-17

5.0,"I really like that this concealer is a fairly light formula for a concealer.  It dabs on without feeling overly heavy, and because it is a more liquid product that some other concealers I've tried, it doesn't tug at your skin when you blend it in.  A light application will not get cakey looking, and it wears well.  It does a good job of covering minor imperfections.  The Biscuit color that I got is a fairly light shade, not the lightest, but meant for fair-skinned people.

4.0,This roll on deodorant lasted through the day for me.  I liked that it was aluminum salts free but the consequence of this was that I did notice some wetness later in the day. It has a very light and pleasant aroma - not perfume at all. You don't have to worry about it conflicting with your cologne.  There was no ill effects when used on my sensitive skin.  The ball is huge so just a swipe or two and you'll get a full and effective application.  If you're not worried by the sticker price this may be a good choice for you.,1498089600,2017-06-22

5.0,"Great smelling mint scent. Makes your scalp tingle and lathers up really well with just a little bit.
Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow dry!

One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you're not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.

  * It is easy to use and convenient to hold
  * It takes a long time and set aside a good amount of time.  Ideally use it for facial hair and hand - I have not tried it for legs
  * You will feel sensation on your skin, if it is high - apply some ice and numb your skin before you use.
  * Does not cause any rash/allergy on skin

So far in my use on face - it completely got rid of the small hair.

2.0,"I saw this product, Crepe Erase, available in the Amazon Vine program and wanted to try it because my skin is starting to look old (crepey) in some areas mainly due to constant tanning when I was younger. (The product description actually states CREEPY-looking skin in one place; I assume this is a typo!)  Given the list price of this, it is not something I would likely buy myself; luckily, I had the opportunity to try it free of charge.  The 10 oz jar is quite big.  If they marketed a jar about one-third of the size (and about one-third of the cost), I think people would be more likely to try it because it would not be so cost-prohibitive.

I was not familiar with Crepe Erase, so I did some reading about it on the Internet.  Crepe Erase is made in the USA and is distributed by Guthy-Renker, a marketing company that sells products to consumers through infomercials, television ads, direct mail, telemarketing, e-mail marketing, and the Internet.  They use celebrity endorsements for their products.  Jane Seymour is the celebrity endorser of Crepe Erase.  The products marketed by Guthy-Renker are usually more expensive than similar products available at your local grocery and drug stores.  Bottom line, the question is:  Does Crepe Erase work better than other comparable products to make it worth its price?  Well

I have now used the product for almost two weeks.  While Crepe Erase works well as a moisturizer, I have not seen any noticeable difference in the youthfulness of my skin.  According to their website:  Results can vary for each individual.  Some users can notice visible results after the first application, while it can take others up to 60 days or longer.  Directions state for best results to use with Crepe Erase Exfoliating Body Polish, which I did not do because of the cost.

Bottom line, based on cost and results thus far, I do not recommend this product.  However, I will continue using it until the jar is gone and will update my review should I notice any changes in the appearance of my skin.",1460592000,2016-04-14

The packaging is lovely! It is simple, clear and clean. I think this is a classic scent that is great in just about any situation. It also lasts all day!

2.0,"It's summer, so what better time to take a chance on a new deodorant?  The scent on this one is like baby powder multiplied.  I can be pretty sensitive to smells.  Strong scents especially perfumes or strong chemicals  are one of the few known triggers for my migraines and this one is bordering on trouble for me.  I didn't actually get a full on migraine but it did make a little nauseous and fearful for about the first hour after I applied it because it stayed really strong that long.

Because of the heat I did use it on a low activity day and it was fine for that.  But once I added in  a little exercise (walking and the simply fit board -- so nothing too demanding) I did start to smell hints of sweat mixed with baby powder.

I would only recommend this for people who either already don't sweat much or those who really like the baby powder scent or for really low activity days.  It's just not strong enough for the kinds of days where you really need protection and the protection is does offer is more of a masking of the sweat with an overpowering scent.",1498176000,2017-06-23

5.0,"I know many people don't get the purpose of thermal water, especially the Evian thermal spray. People tend to associate Evian only with drinking water, and find this aerosol to be no more than a gimmick.
Thermal water works wonders to balance the Ph of the skin, especially for sensitive skin. It can also be used to refresh the skin throughout the day. Some even use it to set their makeup because of the fine, even mist.
I keep mine in the refrigerator and use it first thing in the morning after washing my face. My son has very dry skin, he suffers from eczema, and loves to use it every few hours to add a bit of moisture and refresh the skin.
Ive tried several types of thermal water- Vichy, La Roche Posay, Avene- and the Evian is hands down my favorite; Ive been using it for about 8 years now. Its mostly due to the fact that Evians spray nozzle sprays evenly and is the most consistent, bottle after bottle.
The results from the other brands are practically identical, at least when it comes to its effect on the skin, but Evian is just more dependable. Theres no leaking from the nozzle, no uneven spraying, no clogs, and all the water gets used up.

As is, it is a very nice good size set to try Juice Beauty to clear your complexion. My reason for 4 stars is because of the smell of the products. I found it to smell a little medicinal.

5.0,"Let me start by saying I really hate eye creams.  Hate them passionately.  My eyes are super sensitive, plus I wear contacts so many creams and serums seem to cause issues for me and I end up buying items that I use maybe 3 times before tossing out.  What a waste of money.  Unfortunately, my eye area tends to be very dry and sadly, there are some lines and crepe-y texture trying to happen, so I keep trying to find the holy grail of eye creams...and I think this might actually be it!  I started using this just under a week ago, and upon application, didn't think I was going to like it.  It is very emollient, and didn't immediately absorb into my skin.  Fine for night time (because it's completely absorbed in the morning) but not so great for daytime, I thought.  I forged ahead anyway, lightly blotted the area with tissue and applied my concealer.  It plays very nicely with it, and it makes the area look smooth and fresh, with out causing creasing or smearing.  I was pleasantly surprised!

After using this religiously morning and night, I can honestly say I'm seeing results.  Not only does the skin under my eyes LOOK better, it FEELS better, firmer, smoother, less crepe like and more like a baby's bottom.  The fine lines look softer already, so I'm excited to see what results continued use will provide me.  There's been no irritation, no eye swelling or puffiness that a lot of creams have given me, and no issues with the cream traveling up into my eyes and ruining a pair of contacts.

I DO use this over my hyaluronic acid serum and am certain that it's helping to bind the moisture of this cream to my skin that much better, and maybe it's the combination of these two products that are giving me such dramatic, rapid results, but honestly, this is one of the very best eye creams I've ever tried and I have tried a LOT.  From the obscenely expensive to the cheap as they come variety, this one has them beat, hands down.  I seriously love this eye cream, and as someone who generally despises them, that's saying a lot!",1432944000,2015-05-30
4.0,"There are many things to like about this serum - the lightness of the feel on the skin, the absorbency, the light aroma of orange, the vitamins A,C and E - and the inclusion of a collagen boost.  I haven't been using it long enough to expect visual results and don't know if I will see any on my 80 year old skin.  Several things are bothersome - it has a very high price compared to what appear to be so many other competitive products that promise the same results with many of the same ingredients.  The lack of packaging and instructions also makes one wonder.  At the price, one would expect to receive it boxed with explanations and instructions.  Instead, it arrives just as is, with directions that require a magnifying glass on the back.  There must be a "" backstory"" here that we're not privy to.  Since I like the ingredients, as far as I know them, and it does seem to make my skin softer, and I like the aroma - and it all agrees with my sensitive skin, I'll continue to use it.

5.0,"I used to think buying a wig was my only alternative as a female with alopecia. I started with one little thin spot 20 years ago. Now the entire top of my head is extremely sparse or bald. Nothing worked for me before this. My only problem was that the dark brown was too dark, and the med brown too light. I found out you could pry/twist off the top of the regular size container or larger, and then you could mix colors to get the exact right match.
I attach the sprayer, cover my head in a fine mist, pat, comb. I continue to apply where needed and then spray with the fiber fix (or hairspray, if in a pinch, works fine). My hair is shiny and I am ready to face the world without being embarrassed about my mostly bald head. I now look like I have hair where there is none, or very little.

I don't have a lot of flaws I need to cover; I mostly just need to even out my skin tone.  I found a light application of Dermablend Intense Powder did exactly that while camouflaging some minor imperfections.  Because of the matte finish, I didn't feel the need to apply a powder afterwards.  My skin looks dewy not shiny; its a nice look.  With a light application, the makeup doesnt feel at all thick.  The bronze shade is a little dark for my normally fair to medium skin tone, but, since its summer, and I have a bit of a tan, its the perfect shade.

4.0,"The first thing I do after washing my face is to apply a moisturizer because my skin is on the dry side. I haven't used a concealer in a while, but there have been times that I have wished that I had one on hand. I was quite pleased to have the opportunity to try the Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Invisible Corrective Concealer Anti-Wrinkle CC Cream.

My first impression on seeing the packaging was, wow! It looked like it contained a jar the size of my Bare Minerals Foundation. That seemed like a lot of product. I soon realized that I was mistaken as the jar takes up only about .75% of the box. The box is made with interior walls that hold the smaller jar in place. It disappoints me when I buy a package that seems to hold a good amount, and find that in fact, there is mostly air or excess packaging. I don't see the point of having the much larger package. The jar is attractive, but the lid is nearly as big as the jar itself, which I also think leads the purchaser to ""see"" a larger amount than is actually provided. This is intentional and very common, no matter what we are purchasing. A lot of time and effort is put forth to make us feel we are getting more than we actually get. The jar is pleasing to look at however, and the lid fits snugly. I keep my cosmetics in a small basket and I have no concern about the lid coming off when this is tossed in with the rest.

The product itself is good in my opinion. When I first touched it, it did feel a little clay like, and was not the soft creamy texture I expected. I used the handle tip of a small brush to take a small amount of the product out of the jar, and placed it on the back of my hand, because I prefer to apply and blend make up with my fingers. When applied, the Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Invisible Corrective Concealer Anti-Wrinkle CC Cream is much softer and lighter than I expected it to be. I use a dusting of foundation over it and it works great. Now, I don't have very dark circles under my eyes, but it is a little darker there than I would like. It also covered a small blemish that popped up recently. Bottom line is that I do like this product, and for me, it does a nice job. I am very pleased. My eye area does look brighter when I use this.",1430352000,2015-04-30

I am now on my 3rd purchase of the Lipikar, but now I purchase the Eczema version.  The price is higher than the drugstore brands that I used to buy but I found myself constantly applying them and they never really moisturized my hands.

5.0,"I'm amazed at how nice this sunscreen feels on my skin. As a chronically pale person, I have to wear sunscreen nearly every day; otherwise I burn easily and end up with freckling and sun spots. I've found some SPF moisturizers that feel pretty good, but because of the structure of the lotions, you can hardly ever find any with an SPF above 20. I was a little concerned this one would feel heavy like the Neutrogena dry touch sunscreen I usually use during the summer, but La Roche-Posay Anthelios is light as a feather. My face felt soft and smooth, not sticky or oily at all, and it didn't affect how my makeup went on over the sunscreen at all. And, most importantly, it didn't make my sensitive skin break out after wearing it all day. And it's SPF 60. Fabulous!

It's definitely expensive. $20 for 1.7 fl oz is pretty high for me, but this is one of the nicest sunscreens I've had the pleasure of wearing.",1460678400,2016-04-15
3.0,"**This review will be updated in two months' time with data about facial results.**

There is no doubt this thing is doing something. I feel almost an electric shock if I use it with a wee less gel. The results will take time to see, however. I am not seeing anything instant. My goal with this device is to get rid of the look of a double chin and the lines around my mouth.

There are immediately a few things I'm not crazy about though. The blue light when it charges...annoying. I wish there was a way to turn it off. I tend to charge things while I'm sleeping and this light was so bright, I had to close the bathroom door.

Also, I'm deaf and I don't find having to ""listen"" for beeps very helpful at all. I would appreciate if they'd come up with something else. Perhaps a light where one can see it whilst using it. A flash.

The instructions are easy to follow though. No complaints there. You charge the device 12 hours, you put gel on your face (provided), you hold the shiny balls in place (illustrations show you where) and glide it to another place until you hear a beep. Repeat in a different location.

Again, this review will see continuous updates when more time has passed.

**After a few days of using this, I am not seeing results (don't expect to yet) but I am getting pimples where I use the device. This is not normal for me. I may try using something besides the gel they sent. A previous reviewer said she uses aloe vera. I may try that.",1423180800,2015-02-06

1.0,"My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now.  It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots.  My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair.  And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)!  The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie.  Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar.  It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets.  I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity  because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product!  Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair.  Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place.  Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair.  Instead of enhancing his look,  Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place.",1339286400,2012-06-10
5.0,"This is amazing! I had tried so many other top-rated eye creams, moisturizers and even Vaseline, but this actually keeps my eye area moist, but not greasy, all day or overnight, per application. I don't use it on my upper eye area in the day, so maybe it would interfere with makeup, but it stays put on my under-eye area, and doesn't smudge any under-eye liner. It doesn't irritate my supersensitive eyelid skin, or sting. It has Vitamin C and other anti-aging goodies, but it's too soon to see any effects. There is a lot of peer-reviewed research supporting the efficacy of these ingredients, but I don't know if this is formulated so that the benefits would be realized--but La Roche-Posay is a reputable company, so probably.
I like that it is in an air-tight, opaque tube with a tiny tip. I can dispense just as little as I want, and the rest stays fresh and uncontaminated. Pro tip: you need to unscrew the tip the first time, invert it and press in to puncture the foil seal. If there were instructions on how to do this, I missed them.",1446076800,2015-10-29
3.0,"I've been using the Crepe Erase Duo for three weeks now, and here's what I have learned: The exfoliating scrub is is definitely the better product of the two, the body treatment cream is super thick, and I really can't tell any noticeable difference in my skin.  As for the scrub, a little goes a long way.  I've tried to find more information about the tiny beads used in the scrub to see if they are biodegradable or not, but I have not found any answers.  So I feel a little guilty using it, but it's not too harsh and leaves skin feeling great.  The body treatment cream just isn't for me.  It's very thick and takes a while to apply evenly.  It also leaves my skin feeling too greasy. Many reviewers have commented on the pleasant scent, but I don't find it all that pleasing,  It's pretty strong for my liking- especially for skin care and treatment.  Overall, my skin feels good, but I observe no significant difference.  There are other products out there that I prefer.  I'm glad that I tried the Crepe Erase duo, though.",1460851200,2016-04-17

5.0,"First off, I chose to use an aloe vera gel instead of the included gel. I wanted a more natural option that I could feel good about leaving on my skin. As long as I have enough aloe gel, I really don't feel any of the micro current. When I do feel it, it's not overly uncomfortable, just noticeable. The silver ball attachment is the toning. Think of it like exercise for your face..it only works if you commit to it! But...IT WORKS! Hang in there, give it a week or so of consistent use. I was disappointed at first since I didn't see an immediate difference as I had read could be possible. But, after using it for 5 days, in a row, I could definitely see a difference. What pleased me the most was the furrow between my brows lessened dramatically! That alone was enough to keep me using this. After over a month of consistent use my cheekbones appear higher and more defined due to the facial toning.
I found a video online that shows how to use it on other parts of the body. I regularly do my neck and have also used this on my hands.
The wrinkle reducing attachment is included in this kit. It should be used BEFORE the toning and must be used consistently for 8wks to expect any difference. I really feel like the red light treatment has helped reduce some old scarring on my face. It's so simple to do this light treatment. There's no gel needed and a mirror isn't even necessary. I do this first thing in the morning while having my coffee and reading the news. The flashing red light is obnoxious but I've gotten used to it. It also suggests you wear tinted goggles if the light bugs you.
Overall, I am so, so pleased with the results of the NuFace Trinity trainer and attachment. At first it may seem like a time commitment but you adjust and the results are so worth it.",1439683200,2015-08-16

Every tool works quite well. Their operation (other than the file) can be a little counter intuitive, but there are instructions... even if most guys won't bother to look. ;) Like another reviewer, I found the paper insert with the woman on it weird and tacky, but just like the instructions, the man I tested this kit on didn't even notice it. The carrying pouch is nice.

5.0,"I don't normally wear foundation.  I hate the way I can feel it sitting on my skin and don't like how it can look artificial.
This expensive small pan of water based foundation conquers those two problems for me.

This feels light and cool going on, and is imperceptible to me.  I can't feel it at all.  It evens out my skin tone, conceals my mild rosacea, and looks like perfect beautiful skin rather than makeup.

This is only .4 ounces, and the container is anything but luxe.  It is a screw lid, not a compact, hardly the type of case such an expensive makeup should come in.  But the genius is in the formula.

I applied this first with a fingertip.  I only needed a small amount in the center of my face to look flawless.  While this is not heavy coverage, it is more than enough coverage to even out redness.  If you need heavier coverage, this won't work for that. But for light natural beautiful looking coverage, like you have naturally perfect skin, this is beyond anything I've tried before.  It looks the way good airbrushed makeup can look.  It gives a very smooth even glowing finish, neither oily nor waxy.

I found that the best way to apply this is with a small makeup sponge which has been lightly dampened.  The makeup in the pan is hard but with a damp sponge it comes up easily and applies smoothly.  You have to work fast because within seconds it dries but this isn't a problem, as this blends easily upon application.  This has zero scent or perfume at all.

This is the first water based makeup I've ever loved.  Usually they look chalky and mask like on me.  The third ingredient in this is talc, one ingredient I have always avoided.  I dislike anything dry looking but in this, the talc is imperceptible.

I received the color called Bisque.  I thought it might be too pale for me but it is perfect.  In the pan it looks tan but on my skin it blends in like it was custom blended for me.  This makeup lets your own skin show through, but it enhances it in a way I've never experienced in makeup before. I have pale skin but it is warm without pink tones.  Bisque is perfect.  I am not sure that matching exactly would be difficult with this makeup.  It is sheer and enhances your skin tone rather than covering it up.

I think it's extremely bold to sell four tenths of an ounce of foundation for $57 and I considered knocking this down at least one star for that.  But in marketing it's what the consumers will pay, and they are paying for this without a problem.
I think it would be more palatable to people if you got a full ounce of this.  The ingredients probably cost a few cents, particularly since this says it is 75% water.

I can't feel this makeup on my face nor can I see it.  All I can see is glowing radiant perfect looking skin.  I cringe at the price of this but...would I buy it again, in spite of the cheap looking case and small amount you get?  You bet I would.",1390608000,2014-01-25

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

It is also the first which has not given me tiny, pearly bumps on parts of that delicate skin.  Does it work?  For me, I feel it does.  I have noticed a definite brightening in the area around my eyes, and when applied right after a long shower it seems to help my under eye area hold moisture to remain plumper, which also decreases the look of my biggest crease in that area.

It goes on well, and seems to wear well.  It blends well.  It removes well.  It's a good concealer.  It has a nice consistency.

4.0,"I really like this polish.  It is very easy to apply.  Not thick at all, but rather on the 'runny' side so that it distributes evenly.  It also dries very quickly and leaves a shiny finish.

The color I received is not one I would normally buy.  It's one of those colors that looks different in different lights.  Sometimes grayish, sometimes a hint of lavender.  It would be an intriguing color on toes, and made better on fingers if used for a French effect.

I would definitely buy this brand in a different color.  It went on so well and looked very very good --smooth and shiny.  The bottle isn't especially stable which is why I gave it a minus star.",1469059200,2016-07-21
3.0,"So far this isn't my most favorite toner. I have been using Co Bigelow toner from Bath and Body works for years and I love how soft and smooth my face feels after i use it. This one doesn't leave my face feeling as smooth.

I have never used a toner that had a spray top, and i'm still not sure how i feel about it. The convenience of being able to spray without having to dab the toner onto a cotton ball is nice, but i also feel like i am wasting a lot by not being able to spray perfectly onto my face without missing.

 The Co Bigelow contains witch hazel which heals my face quickly after a blemish, this does not have that. They cost about the same price, Co Bigelow is a little bit cheaper, and I will still continue to use them even after trying this one. Toner in general is great for closing pores and making your skin softer, more firm, and it goes on really easy.",1474502400,2016-09-22

5.0,"Must say~ Best Part of this is the sprayer!!

It covers your whole face in a perfect mist!
No drips, drizzles, or concentration to one area of your face.
Four sprays thorughly covers your whole face.

I live in a year round warm climate & work outside.
So sweat is a given and setting spray is my only hope of concealer lasting past lunch.

I've used all setting sprays from NYX to Urban Decay.
All perfectly respectable products.

This Dermablend spray is in a category on its own.
It's the only one that I can feel a soft, yet tacky finish, implying it may actually last & it does.
You can only feel this by touching your face.
In no way will you notice it moving your face.

Most setting sprays I've tried seem to do more to set the finishing powder into your skin for a natural look.
While they extend the length of coverage, it's rarely all day when I'm working outside.

The Dermablend actually made my make up AND my skin look better!
The highlights & contours ebbed & flowed as I had been effortlessly airbrushed.

This is a steal at this price point!!

*QUICK TIP*
Apply mascara as last step in routine.
Spray before mascara.
Will give mascara a primer type base & help thicken your lashes.
As well, mascara won't smudge to if you spray after.

Hope this helps & as always feel free to ask any questions",1497398400,2017-06-14

5.0,"Foremost, know that the blue glass jar will help protect against decomposition from sunlight, but it should still be stored somewhere cool and dark. Likewise, know that these come completely sealed to further preserve the product. Therefore, these can be housed in a supply/linen closet (if you are obsessed with keeping extras on-hand like I am).

Now, I was a little thrown by the herbaceous scent. But I quickly grew fond of it ... a little mossy, a little earthy. It may take you a day or two to adjust, but I have a feeling you may end up liking it. (I was using fruit-based products by Ole Henrikson, so this was a slight adjustment).

The creme is pleasantly thick, leaves no residue (no white marks, no greasy feel, etc.), and just melts into skin.

Since I use a prescription retinoid, I use this on my off-days (every other day). It soothes my skin and leaves it incredibly soft and touchable. This is especially true for Clarisonic users. When I am dutiful, I apply after using my Clarisonic, and the results are amazing.

When used in tandem with a prescription retinoid (prescribed by your dermatologist), the results are genuinely impressive.

This is what introduced me to the power and benefits of glycolic acid. My arms used to be so rough and I used to get so embarrassed when people stroked it. Kiss that all goodbye. This lotion got rid of ALL of the KP. All!!! Not some, but ALL!

The KP on my legs is proving more stubborn but it has definitely come a long way from what it used to be. I would recommend and over recommend. In fact, Glytone should make me a Brand Ambassador! ;)

It may sting after some time. When that happens, what I do is to
1. Either lay off the product for a bit or
2. Mix with a nice oil of my choice (shea butter, coconut). This seems to dilute the product and make it more tolerable.

This drying lotion should be used as soon as you feel that painful spot on your face. I use it at night after cleaning my face and sleep with it on.

I did needed to rub a bit more or use extra oil to remove my eye make up but other than that is works great.  My lotions, foundations etc came off fairly easily and when I dried my face on my towel I don't see any make-up residue!
The only problem is that I have allergies.  At first I didn't mind the faint baby powder smell.  But I notice the more I use the product the more it is starting to bother me.  My eyes and nose feel a little irritated and now my skin is starting to feel uncomfortable.  My skin is clean but doesn't feel clean.  Because of this I stopped using it regularly and after use I wash it off thoroughly with warm water.  But even after that my skin is still soft.  I think due to my reaction I will have to discontinue use it soon.  Which is such a shame!  But for people who aren't really sensitive I think this is a great alternative to the other soaps on the market which are abrasive and strip your skin.

The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

It sits on the surface of your skin long enough so that the moisturizer can penetrate the skin gradually over time, but not so long that it never fully absorbs.

4.0,"This is one of the most effective hand creams I have found. I'm a professional landscaper, and my hands get thrashed. But nobody knows that, because each night I exfoliate and moisturize heavily so that I can still have nice hands.

This is a wonderful cream because it sinks in, doesn't sting cracked skin, and really provides long-lasting protection and healing. One tube lasts forever, in fact I usually get the gift set of small tubes of L'Occitane hand creams just for some variety, and I find that the three small tubes easily last me the year.

The two things I dislike are the scent, which smells a bit like old-lady cold cream - not unpleasant, but a bit more perfumey than I like, and the cap, which is fiddly and hard to get back on once you've moisturized your hands.

Other than that, this is a highly effective cream that works great for healing hands that have been in the dirt.",1295568000,2011-01-21

A.) The dropper is what it should be - works perfectly because the angle at the end makes it so.

B.) The other C serums I tried were 20% and I feel that I got faster and bigger results than this 10% one. I am presuming the C percentage matters based on this experience.

C.) Some C serums come with hyaluronic acid as an ingredient, and one that I tried earlier that had both C and hyaluronic acid got me the best results.

D.) The added fragrance is good, I think. Normally I don't like anything with added fragrance but it's just the smallest touch and it makes me feel more confident in the product somehow. I liked it.",1485648000,2017-01-29

The colors I got, which is Shade 06, is a little too purplish for my skin tone. I also don't wear a lot of purple, which is a shame because I really like the color.

It is a very soft eye shadow. It goes on sleek and smooth. I used a kleenex to put it on since I was out of brushes. It goes on smooth. However, it does not stay on for very long. It seems to disappear within a few hours and since I am not one to constantly reapply make up all day, this doesn't work for me.

It is a glamorous eye shadow duo and for the price is a bit on the steep side if you're one of those people who don't spend that much on make up. It also makes a very nice gift for those women in your life who do appreciate fine makeup.",1421366400,2015-01-16

I wear a lot of earthy colors especially going into fall and winter and RUBBLE is a warm taupe brown that just goes with everything.  It will dress up beautifully with one or two layers of gold VIP layered over it.  Done properly, a CND Shellac will last 1-3 weeks.

 I have softer flexible nails - My nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer.  Acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic 'off brand' gel polish, they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak.  Before Shellac I gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day.  I type a lot at work as well as boxing and packing stuff so I am tough on my hands.  Shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy WITHOUT any filing.

5.0,"This is a lighter, fruitier fragrance with slight overtones of jasmine and spice mingled in with the citrus notes. Even when initially applied, it isn't cloying or overpowering. It is delicate enough so that even if you find perfumes to be initially overwhelming, you probably won't have that problem with Rochas Eau Sensuelle.

Upon application the citrus notes predominate. This lends the fragrance an appealing freshness that is subtle enough so that as it begins to mature on the skin and the floral elements come to the fore, it retains its appeal even as the aroma becomes more complex. The various elements of the fragrance don't clash as they are released on the skin, an unfortunate attribute which can give lesser perfumes a slightly unpleasant bitterness which I find off-putting. There is a pleasant and attractive balance of fragrances that is revealed over the 4-6 hours of a single application's efficacy.

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29
4.0,"I like this eyeliner because I can get a nice thin line close to my eyelashes. It stays wet long enough that I can use the broken stem  of a QTip to wipe away most mistakes. (I break them in half to use the stem to clean up mascara smudges too).
Even though this Bliss eyeliner is easier to use than other liners I've tried, I still need more practice.
I like to apply thin lines, but you can can get thicker lines my angling the tip.  This is a liquid liner and doesn't have a smudgy appearance.  It washes off with soap and water and doesn't irritate my eyes.",1468368000,2016-07-13
5.0,"This 24 hour Deodorant cream is fragrance free and contains no alcohol or parabens. I am impressed at how light the cream is and how it is readily absorbed leaving behind no residue to stain clothing. I am accustomed to using mostly solid stick deodorants, so I expected this to be somewhat messy to apply, but just squeeze out a small amount of cream (1/4 to 1/2 inch) and use the tubes smooth rounded neck area where the product is released to apply. A little goes a long way.

A complete list of ingredients is on the product page (page down and look under Product Description) so I won't repeat the information here. The product contains aluminum salts, a component known for its effectiveness in controlling perspiration and its accompanying odor. In the past I avoided it but after using natural products that simply did not work I read further and could not find definitive scientific evidence of an issue.

This particular product does not irritate that delicate area and since I do not like to smell any odor whether perspiration or a perfumed deodorant drifting from my underarms, I buy unscented products so I particularly appreciate this fragrance-free cream, something not as prevalent as the perfumed varieties. As with everything, cost is an individual consideration but regarding results, the cream works well.",1492905600,2017-04-23
4.0,"I've been in love with La Roche Posay products ever since I've discovered their amazing acne treatments.

This treatment, as far as I can tell, is made to draw moisture to the skin to ""plump up"" wrinkles--but it doesn't actually do anything to get rid of them. I've been using this only in the mornings, under my eyes, before applying concealer. It goes on smoothly and absorbs easily. No irritation. It actually does make the wrinkles look less prominent.

4.0,"As one other reviewer said, ""Nothing unwrinkles wrinkles."" And to be honest, I don't have a lot of wrinkles to start with, so I won't comment at all about this product's effectiveness on wrinkles. BUT, my skin gets dry at times, and I'm not getting any younger...

So--the scent is really nice. I was neither crazy about it nor hated it when I first tried this, but as I've been using it the scent has grown on me to the point I can say I genuinely like it.

It goes on smoothly. I rub it between my palms and then gently spread it over my face and neck (except on my nose and to either side, where I tend to have oily skin). I found it goes on and absorbs better that way than using my fingertips. It makes my skin feel soft, and not greasy.

Love that it's made from organic ingredients.

I've been using it morning and night. I have a feeling that would be too often for me if I were using this during the summer here in Florida, but it's been cooler and dryer lately, so twice a day has been just right.

What I intended to say in this review is that I'd never actually *pay* the price for this product (I received it free as a Vine reviewer), but now that I've been using it, I'm not sure I can say that anymore. I've tried several less expensive products (some organic, some not) and always given up on them within a week for various reasons. I've found nothing to complain about with this so far, though, and could see myself wanting to continue with it when this far is empty. However, I still feel the price is rather steep, so I can't really give it five stars. It's not miracle-working, just a very nice moisturizer, so for $45 for this little 2-ounce jar I can't justify a five-star rating. If I change my mind about that when I've finished this jar, I'll update my review.",1415491200,2014-11-09

4.0,"My main complaint with this stuff is that it ships in a glass jar. That makes it difficult to toss into my bag for traveling.

That said, just a little bit provides enough control without leaving my hair stiff. Based on its texture and consistency, I was a little afraid that it would leave my hair looking ""wet"" all day, but that is not the case, at least with the amount that I use.

There is a slight fragrance, but it is more pleasant than not (a bit of citrus, I guess) and it does not linger.

All in all, good stuff. I might heat it up a little and pour some into a plastic tube for traveling, though.",1375401600,2013-08-02
3.0,"When they say use a pea-sized amount, use a pea-sized amount. The problem with that is you will feel like it doesn't make much of a difference, so you're tempted to use more, but even a little bit more makes your hair stiff and sticky, although it settles down after you roll it or iron it or hot brush it or sleep on it. So the amount is critical, somewhere between this does nothing and this makes me look like Frankenstein's bride. The slapping your hands back and forth -- not sure what that does. It does sort of whip it up like you're whipping cream and the blob of cream starts to develop peaks.",1502928000,2017-08-17
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20

I have successfully worn this under makeup, and I like to apply it at night as well for added benefit. The container is small but it is a spot treatment and after a month of use it still feels mostly full. This is absolutely worth trying.

3.0,"I always read at least a few reviews before writing my own to see if there are any issues with products I need to address and to try to offer different information to readers like you.  I read another reviewer had a problem with bristles falling out of her brush, so I knew to lookout for it. I used my brush like her for a week and washed with mild soap and water.  I had about a dozen small bristles fall out.  You can't tell any difference in the brush now, but if that trend continues for the lifetime of the brush, there won't be any brush left!  I still gave it 3 stars for now because it is so soft to use and provides a good shape and finish to my powders.  I use it with a compact of Neutrogena pressed powder.  I'm going to come back and give an update, but at least you know for now it could be an issue.  I see there are other reviewers that don't mention a similar issue so maybe we just got some bad brushes?  However, you may not want to chance that with your hard earned money.",1458172800,2016-03-17
2.0,"Once you've tried one cologne shower gel, you've tried them all. The scent is strong, but the bubbles are slim. No pouf in the world can give you the soapy suds you desire and it never feels like it's doing any cleaning. This is especially true of the Burberry gel.

If you are determined to buy it, I recommend using your usual bar or favorite body wash first so you will actually be clean and then follow up with the Burberry so your skin will smell like a Dillard's Men's Department for the next thirty minutes.

Admittedly I do love the Burberry Brit Rhythm scent. It's conventionally masculine but a step above your typical locker room clich. It's deep and sexual, but not especially overpowering. The gel does not linger on your skin for long, so if you aren't going to follow-up with the cologne itself, you better move fast and get someone in bed because otherwise, no one will notice.

OVERALL: I would never recommend any shower gel that is from a cologne line and do not recommend the Burberry either. They all fail as a cleansing soap, are overexpensive, and, most surprisingly, the fragrance doesn't linger. I do like the scent, though, so if you're shopping around for a new cologne, you might give Brit Rhythm a sniff to see if it fits your needs.",1404086400,2014-06-30
3.0,"This is a very nice cream, albeit a bit on the heavy side (your mileage may vary), and outside of the heaviness, very easy to apply. Bonus points for no noticeable scent that lingers on forever and ever. That said, it appears other reviewers are having better results from the product than I've been getting, after a week of testing this out.  I've had much better results with an Olay product I received a few weeks prior to this product, and with a lower price tag, and for that I've dropped a star off the rating, and again, your mileage may vary.",1475280000,2016-10-01
5.0,"Love this new color. Just got it in the mail today and already had to try it out. It is a deep, dark navy with silver shimmer. Indoor, it almost looks black, but in the sunlight, it is like a deep sapphire. It goes on easy and thin. One coat gives even coverage (I find some, like ""romantic"", need two coats to look even), but I did two color coats for a darker navy. I have been waiting for a color like this from CND. I am a Shellac addict and buy a new color every month or so, and this was my first of the new Fall 2012 line. I am not disappointed. I actually combined it with Black Pool tips for a must have black on navy french manicure. I can't wait to try some of the other fall colors! One hint - with the darker colors, make sure you have a small touch-up brush and some isopropyl alcohol to clean up around the edges, because they must be extra crisp to look good.",1349740800,2012-10-09

4.0,"When I think of free radicals, I think of people waving signs in the street, protesting this or that government decision. But there is another kind of free radical. This kind of free radical is related to an atom or molecule that ""has a single unpaired electron in an outer shell."" (Thank you, Wikipedia!) I don't pretend to understand them, but I don't have to. The makers of Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum do and they know that free radicals should be reduced when possible. This product reduces free radical aging in skin cells and can help your skin feel and, hopefully, with time, look younger.

The ingredients include age-defying peptides, DMAE, alpha lipoic acid, fat-soluble and CoQ10. Like those free radicals, I don't really understand all of them, but I do know this serum has a very pleasing, yet understated aroma. It blends into the skin smoothly, and once there it is undetectable. It feels good, too.

4.0,"The Sultra The Bombshell Rod Curling Iron I really like. I am able to quickly and easily achieve the styles for my hair that I was hoping to get from a styling tool such as this.

For the higher price tag, I assumed this would have a few more features like beeping when I've held a curl long enough ( 8 seconds per instructions) or an option to adjust the heat but it doesn't.  Because it doesn't have these features, I am taking a a star off just because I feel for the price these important and somewhat expected features should have been implemented.

The features this curling iron does have is that it heats up very quickly, there's a 9-foot no-tangle swivel cord, an auto-shut off safety feature, and it's light-weight. Included is a styling glove and an iron pad to rest the iron on when needing to place it down while styling your hair.
My hair is very long. It's thick and normally quite wavy. That being said, I do have to spend some time on my hair for certain styles. I typically use this iron to achieve a few ringlets here and there but not all over. The results come out great when paired with heat protection sprays applied first.
The Curling iron is easy to use. There is one power switch which goes up and down i.e off and on. I haven't accidentally bumped it off when styling.  Since there is no adjustable heat settings, there's nothing else to fiddle with. You simply wait about a minute and the iron is ready to use. When styling it's important to use the glove so you don't accidentally burn yourself. When wrapping and getting to the last bit of that hair to curl my fingers get pretty close to the heating unit so I am glad the glove is included.
The amount of time needed for each curl to set will fully depend on how much hair your grab at once. If it's a smaller, thinner amount I would suggest 8 seconds but it's a thicker amount 15 seconds may be better. There will be trial and error to find what best works so a learning curve is necessary.

I can style my hair with this tool and results can last for a couple of days. I am quite pleased with the look I get and how no-brainer this tool is to use. I didn't get any weird bumps or things like others have mentioned in their reviews. I am including pictures of my waves and ringlets with my post so you can see the results I got.

There is a two-year warranty on this product which is great for the money you'll be shelling out on it. I feel the price is reasonable for the high-quality hair styling you can achieve. The product is solid and does what it should minus a few features I hope they'll add to their next model.",1524182400,2018-04-20

I have tried a lot of different products, and nothing has really helped much until I tried the Dead Sea Essentials tea tree cream. Man, what a difference! The calluses have softened considerably and the skin is much smoother and softer. I've been using the tea tree cream in the morning for about two weeks and have noticed a very big improvement. I even like the smell of the cream, which goes away once the cream is absorbed into the skin. I like that I know recognize what most of the ingredients are rather than chemicals and like even better that it is not tested on animals.

4.0,"This product works well for adding just a little color to the face. I wanted to try it because I do not like wearing make-up every day. With a medium light complexion, applied every few days it evens out my skin tone and acts like a subtle bronzer to provide a healthier glow.

Since I am not interested in a true tan, I just apply as it becomes apparent the last application has faded  which in my case is every three or four days. The cream has a pleasant vanilla scent which quickly evaporates. The recommended quantity needed to cover face and neck is a dime-size dollop and that is plenty. The tube should easily last a couple of months with my limited use.

I have greater control over the application just using my hands, but the product does stain so promptly wash hands with warm soapy water. I have not experienced any fake orange color and am over-all pleased with the result.",1443571200,2015-09-30

5.0,"This stuff smells wonderful.  It is highly scented and after it all dries, it does leave significant scent in the hair.  It smells tropical to me, but more like a pineapple vanilla scent - it doesn't really smell like anything I've smelled before.  It's nice, and works well for men and women.

I love that this goes on dry hair.  It lets me put it right where it's needed.  It's a thin white cream in a tube container, and it comes out evenly and well.  It's easy to control the amount that comes out.  It only takes a bit for me because I am able to put it right where I needed it instead of all over my head.

It works good for my son's curly frizzies - he color treats his long hair and gets some serious frizz where his hair is very curly close to his ears.  This controls it well.  I like it for smoothing down sections of my hair before braiding it.  It makes braids look a lot neater and shinier.  Also, the very ends of my braids are often like straw because that is the longest, most damaged hair.  It softens those dry straw ends well.

It's not by any means a 'natural product.'  The ingredient list is long and mostly stuff I can't pronounce, but it does work.",1461196800,2016-04-21

5.0,"A lot of fancy bar soaps are too floral for me.  So this one is a nice alternative (I am reviewing the verbena scent).  It is less floral (even though verbena is a flower) than you might expect.  The scent is just a touch herbal but not overly so, and fresh without being artificial.  I'm having a difficult time describing it, but I do really like it.  (For what it's worth, the scent doesn't stick around forever, so you don't have to worry about this conflicting with other fragrances you were planning to wear.)

The quality of the soap is good, too.  I feel that it gets me clean without being drying, and that it lathers pretty well for a bar soap.  It also doesn't dissolve/disintegrate too much in water, so it lasts longer than some of the handmade soaps I've tried recently.  I've been going for a few weeks, actually, on a sample-sized bar.

5.0,"First of all, I have used many products made by Vichy so I always have great expectations being that all the products I have owned made by them have been excellent.  I am not disappointed here either.

Vichy products tend to be very pure; they are gentle, and without much scent, or they have no scent at all.  The consistency of these products have been lighter than normal beauty substances, not reeking of chemicals, and non comedogenic.  I haven't reacted to any of them yet, including this product.  This product is not going to taint your clothing in my opinion, and it makes sense for a stay-dry deodorant to not have too much stickiness or waxiness - ya know - it might defeat the purpose.

No aluminum!  This is a cancer-causing agent if I am not mistaken, and I am happy to not have this substance in my maximum stay-dry deodorant.

The mechanism used to crank out this solid works very well.  Sometimes I will get a deodorant solid which is difficult to maneuver.

The ingredients list is more benign in my opinion than popular deodorant brands'.  You will see what I mean about the purity.  Also, I have used it already two days now with good results.

I use this on my face and haven't had any burning.  It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky and, best of all, there's no white residue!

The mango smell is moderately strong when you're applying the sunscreen, but quickly dissipates.  I'm only using a bit on my face. I don't know how it would be if I slathered it all over my body.

4.0,"I don't have much experience with foundation. In high school, I wore the cakey stage make-up for shows, which I think may have had something to do with my general aversion to it. But recently, I have started experimenting a bit more into the world of foundations. The first foundation that I tried is more of a tinted spot-check, very light coverage. This is a more substantial foundation. It feels a lot thicker and has better coverage. This shade is perfect for my winter tones - with a summer tan this will be a bit too light, I think. But overall it goes on nicely, and provides a smoothing look that evens skin tone color. I feel like, overall, my face looks smoother and I don't feel like my face is too stiff or cakey with this makeup.

I may not wear this everyday, but I will certainly wear it on special occasions!",1415836800,2014-11-13

3.0,"I recently purchased this, obviously, in hopes of getting more voluminous hair.  I have only used it a few times and I do feel that it does what the product description says.  My problem with this stuff is that a sediment has formed in the bottom of the bottle and it prevents the sprayer from working properly.  I am able to spray once and then I have to wait several seconds before I can spray again...if I can spray at all.  It has been completely clogged.  I tried heating the bottom of the bottle with my hair dryer and letting it sit in a bowl of warm water in hopes of loosening up the sediment.  The hair dryer had no effect and the warm water did work some but not nearly enough.  I think I will be contacting the manufacturer and will try to update this review afterwards.

4.0,In terms of effectiveness this Baxter under eye complex does work.  It takes a small quantity under your eyes to reduce the puffy circles that you would ordinarily get with fatigue.  It won't eliminate the puffiness or circles completely but it does tend to help.  The other benefit is that this is supposed to prevent wrinkles.  I am not too sure about this claim but your mileage may vary.  The one big downside to this is that it is very pricey.  You get less than 1 oz of for almost $30 bucks which seems a bit outrageous especially when other remedies (such as hemorrhoid cream) work equally well at reducing puffiness around the eyes.,1468108800,2016-07-10

5.0,"As warranted by my other reviews on Ahava products, I exclusively use them as part of skin care regimen. Having traveled to Israel in 2009 and visited the Dead Sea, I learned of not only the therapeutic qualities for the richly mineral waters, but of its benefits to aging skin. I took home several products while I was there and have been hooked ever since. I turned 60 earlier this year and I honestly can say, my skin has never looked better. This was the first time I tried the Time to Hydrate moisture gel cream. It goes on thick and luxurious and, at first, I was afraid it might be two rich to use during the day. I was entirely wrong. It sinks into your skin within a minute or so and my skin felt almost instantly plumper and silkier. I am using this now several times a day and it is wonderful.

4.0,"I just bought this color and tried Infinite Shine for the first time. I am blown away! I had to come and leave a review.

Pros: it's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate. It's INCREDIBLY shiny- I have been doing my own gel nails at home with a gel light for years and this polish looks the exact same as when I do my nails in gel. It dries fast; I painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it's totally dry. I also love the color. It looks a lot like You Dont Know Jacques.

Cons: None yet! I will check back in to see if it truly lasts the 7-10 days as advertised.

Update 11/1/15- Sadly, the product does not last that long. I've tried two separate colors and it only lasts about 3 days before it starts to chip. Definitely better than a ""regular"" top coat, not nearly as good as my gel nails at home.",1443139200,2015-09-25

This leaves skin feeling clean and not dry.  We recently had to use theatrical makeup, which can be very harsh if your skin is stripped too far, but will not stick if there are any oils on your skin.  I chose this to use to do that extra cleansing before the application of spirit gum, latex, and makeup, and it was perfect!  The skin was in prime condition and the aforementioned remained steadfast for 12 hours!",1446422400,2015-11-02
2.0,"This is my second attempt to try something from this brand because I do love their packaging. Unfortunately I think the products are not for me. This particular eye shadow had zero staying power although it applies nicely and looks really cute when you put it on. It is a very nice shimmery champagne color that is sort of nude on med skin tone (like mine). The first time I used it it creased like crazy and it felt like my eyelid was sort of greasy, but I thought that maybe it was because I had worked out. The second time I wore it to school (did use primer) and by lunch it had already creased into a thick line so I had to wipe it off. I use other shimmery shades and haven't experienced the same problem, in spite of having a little bit of a hooded eyelid.",1420934400,2015-01-11
3.0,"After using it for 2 weeks, I do notice slight improvement in the darkness around my eyes.  The puffiness is also a little bit better but to be honest I can't really tell if anyone has noticed.  i should note that the improvement could been attributed to other things, such as sleep, diet (hydration), and stress.  I just finished a project at work around the time I started using this product so it's really unclar to me if this product is working or if I'm simply less stressed out.

I will continue to use this product over the next 2 weeks before I make up my mind about it.  For now I will give it 3 stars since it is easy to apply and does not irritate my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and generally never use any facial products other than soaps.  Nearly everything I've ever had put on my face beyond that has caused it to react negatively. So I was very pleased to see this product produced no irritation.  It's a clear light ointment that is dispensed from a small squatty plastic ""thumb"". It's nice I don't have to use my hands to apply it. (I have very rough hands because I like to build thinks, work on cars, and just lots of other guy stuff. Yes I am a dude, but I'm reaching mid-40s and it's beginning to show.)  The ointment is a a tad oily when you apply it and but only a little is needed and it doesn't really show once you rub it in well.

Overall the product has not shown its ""legs"" yet.  As I stated I do see slight improvement but it's not enough proof for me that it actually works.  I will try to update this review in a few weeks.  If I don't, please feel free to leave me a comment. I will see it in my email box and it will remind me to update the review.

Products like this fall in to a ""YMMV"" category. That is, ""Your Mileage May Vary"".  It's too early for me to discount the product as a bust so I will still recommend you try it. It certainly doesn't hurt to give it a try since I confirmed (at least for me) that it has been non-irritating.",1415923200,2014-11-14

It's an effective cleanser that works gently without harsh chemicals or over powering fragrances.  I find that it smells refreshing. It does a very good job of removing makeup - even in sensitive areas, such as eye make-up.

3.0,"I've used this product every day for about 10 days now. I don't have incredibly crepey skin yet since I'm still fairly young, but I've been using this on my throat/dcolletage area. the exfoliator solution is soft and gentle and not a harsh scrub at all, which is nice. I do wonder, however, if the little microbeads are fully water soluble as they run down my shower drain.  The beads don't seem to ""burst"" as the beads in some other products do (and I think the US is outlawing those microbeads soon too?).

The moisturizer is very thick but doesn't feel like it's oily.  It has a good feel and a mostly clean scent to it.  After I apply the moisturizer I feel like my skin looks ""brighter"" somehow, much more so than if I just use regular moisturizer on my neck area.  So while I definitely would say that the product combo makes for healthy looking skin, I don't really know if I'd feel confident saying that it improves the crepey appearance.  Maybe I just haven't been using it long enough yet, but I'd be hard pressed to believe any product will actually fix the skin anyway, so I wasn't expecting miracles.",1461024000,2016-04-19

The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

The Beat has a very delicate fragrance, but it's almost a musky kind of smell, but with a little bit of a clean smell to it as well. The first day I wore it, my 24 yr. old daughter asked me what I was wearing. When I told her what it was, she immediately asked if she could borrow it. She has used this brand before, and is a big fan. I had never heard of it before, but am now a big fan as well.",1404259200,2014-07-02

4.0,"I typically use a face moisturizer with SPF, but this is a much higher SPF and more suitable for spending a lot of time outside.  It is also tinted, but blends well and leaves an attractive matte finish rather than the typical slight gloss.  The thick texture makes it easy to apply without getting in the eyes, with the downside being that you need more to cover the same area and it is not cheap.  It also doesn't have that nice Retinol plumping effect or the evening of skin tone.  Still, there is something to be said for a product that goes on well and washes off like it was never there.  I will continue using it when I plan to be outside more.",1502150400,2017-08-08
4.0,"A bit pricey for something that gets used up a bit too fast, but cooling and soothing makes you feel really fresh after a shower.  I have used AXE and other body scrubs, and I like to use them after I exfoliate with a brush and a good soap.  Exfoliation is the best way to get clean in the bath or shower.  One of the things I learned on a scientific TV special years ago was that showering with hot or warm water actually encourages bacterial growth.  I was confused then how you'd keep from being eaten alive by microbes or why we all didn't stink to high heaven after a warm bath.  The answer is soap and other things that scrub away the skin which then carries the bacteria down the drain.  When I first use soap and get the basic grime off my skin when rubbed starts to ball up little bits to wash off.  A good body wash will cleanse that, even more and leave a good clean base behind.  It might even do you some good to run cool water when you're done to get the remaining bacteria to stop multiplying.

After a good soaping, and rinse this compound with some cooling and cleaning and other protective ingredients makes the skin feel fresh and alive. The scent is fantastic, but I question a bit the use of sugar in the compound.  Maybe it doesn't matter because pure sugar won't create bacterial growth, the question is will it in combination with skin cells give them something to eat, or is it inhibited by the other ingredients.  After a couple uses, I've noticed it lasts a long time even in the heat, so I don't suspect the sugar does much to make it bad.  On the Happy Buddha, it the jar talks of his smiling journeys and people rubbing his big tummy for luck.  I had an interesting experience taking a Japanese Saturday school class.  At the presentation event where each class does various plays, readings, singing or other presentations, they hold a lunch afterwards with lots of Japanese food from the parents and from patron businesses.  I was sitting there eating some sort of curry dish when a little kid came up to me, looked me right in the eye and rubbed my stomach (which is somewhat large).  I wondered what the heck was going on till one of the instructors said it's good luck in Japan to rub the bellies of Sumo Wrestlers.  I think that's an offshoot of the Happy Buddha maybe as the body shapes are similar.  Recommended, for a clean and invigorating feeling after bath or shower.",1529193600,2018-06-17
4.0,"Vichy claims that this BB Cream does 6 things. (1) Illuminates instantly, which it does. Skin appears to glow when even a thin layer of this cream is applied. That's partly due to the titanium dioxide and mica, but whatever the reason, this is the strongest quality of the cream. On the other hand, if you don't like an illuminated look, you'll definitely want to avoid it. (2) Hydrates. I think it does, but my skin is so dry that I moisturize a lot before applying. Probably the best test is at the end of the day at which point my skin still feels moist. (3) Visibly smooths fine lines. At the very least it doesn't emphasize fine lines, which some makeups do. (4) Pores look refined. I have small pores already, but I'd say this BB Cream minimizes them further. (5) Conceals dark spots. I get no concealing effect AT ALL. None. So, for me, it utterly fails on this claim. (6) UVA/UVB protection. This claim is absolutely true. The significant amounts of chemical sunscreens that give this an SPF 25 rating have prevented any suntan or sunburn every time I've worn it. Unfortunately, on the two occasions that I applied it near my eyes, the sunscreens ran into my eyes and stung for over an hour. So, I'd say this Vichy Idealia BB Cream delivers on 5 of its 6 claims.

Here's where the problems lie. (1) The color range is stunningly narrow. There are only two colors as far as I've been able to discover, the Light and the Medium. I tried both. Neither of them worked for me. So, I combine the two and get a reasonable shade for my light skin. (2) The cream has a fragrance. A lot of reviewers both here and on MakeupAlley say that they like the scent. I don't. But it isn't so strong that I can't stand it. Over a short time, it fades. (3) There is no coverage. I get a bit of skin ""treatment"" and a nice glow from this, but my dark undereye circles and few broken capillaries are not camouflaged. If the coverage were stronger, the too-light Light and the too-dark Medium shades would really be a problem. (4) There is no way I can use this anywhere near my eyes. The runny texture and the chemical sunscreens make this impossible to wear either on my upper lids or undereye area. The eye area is where I need foundation most, so I use a foundation like Dermablend cream or L'Oreal True Match around my eyes and use this BB Cream on my cheeks and jawline. So, instead of making my makeup routine quicker and easier, this adds a step.

5.0,"I've used many, many masks in the past, but this has to be my new favorite.

Let's start with the many, many pluses:
1.) easily fits on face and the backing easily peals off
2.) not one drip! NOT ONE! WOW!
3.) able to be torn (with ease) to fit perfect around eyes
4.) every single bubble can be smoothed out
5.) stays on face without slipping one bit! (Again, WOW!)
6.) Leaves skin plump and glowing

Negatives:
-NOT ONE NEGATIVE!

In total frankness, I am demanding on my skin. I use prescription retinoids (every other day), I micro-needle (twice a week), etc. Sometimes it just really needs something to soothe it (especially if I go a little nuts with the micro-needling). This does exactly that. I am so impressed.

And, here's a little tip: use the left over liquid in the packet on your neck and hands. They will be left just as smooth as your face.

4.0,"Whether or not you like a particular brand of mascara is dependent on what you want from the product.  Some mascara are designed to produce major thickening or volume.  If that's what you're looking for, this product is probably not going to make you happy.  But if you want color and length without any clumps you will probably really like this mascara, as I do.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is price.  The La Roche Posay Respectissime mascara costs about $25.  The L'Oreal Telescopic Mascara costs about $8.  I had been using the L'Oreal and am happy with it -- it goes on easily, separates, darkens, and does not clump.  Does not irritate my eyes.  When I had a chance to compare it to the La Roche Posay I was very interested to see if there were differences.  The brushes are a little different.  The L'Oreal brush is thinner and the little projections are more rigid than the La Roche Posay, which seems more like a conventional mascara brush.  The ingredient list is similar if not identical with water and wax being the main components of both. The two products go on similarly and look about the same.  The LaRoche Posay might be just a tad smoother or more silky but if there is a difference, it is a small one.  I like both products very much and if I were doing a controlled blind test I am not sure I would be able to tell them apart.  So I would say the  L'Oreal is a good dupe for this at about a third of the price.",1488412800,2017-03-02
5.0,"Update 5/29-
I color my hair. Sometimes my head feels hot when I do.
I wear my hair in a ponytail a lot, in the sun. Again, hot head & tight.
My scalp is tortured.
I've started pressing this into my scalp bc of the mint & my head is instantly refreshed.
Maybe it's in my head, (haha, get it?) but I feel this gets the blood going again & it smells so good.

Update 4/12-
For test purposes, I used the exact same products on my hair sans the Oribe.
I used my leave in conditioning spray, after my hair was towel dried, in place of the Oribe.

My hair was ok but not nearly as soft.
I must use a deep conditioner because of years of hair abuse but it weighs down my hair by day 3 if I don't wash.

The Oribe gave me deep conditioner quality softness with leave in conditioner weightlessness.
It's magically found a way to keep moisture & bounce and, it smells great.

Also, the bottle is really growing on me.
I feel pretty just using the jade green bottle.

Original review-
I know usually packaging is irrelevant but this arrives in a cardstock quality box.
He made me laugh when he saw the bottle & said it looked like cut jade.
It really is pretty, even for plastic.

Seems like it would be a great gift for the beauty fan in your life.
 It is packaged & priced as a luxury item & would make a beautiful impression ti make someone feel special.

So, does it work?

I followed the instructions & used it after shampoo but before my regular conditioner.
I use a paraben free thickening shampoo which leaves my hair very squeaky & easily knotty if I don't follow with good conditioner.

I usually use a leave in (Redken All Soft)
after I towel dry, to smooth out frizz.
 I skipped my leave in to see what this would do.

This was wonderful to immediately detangle after shampoo.
There is a light mint smell which felt clean & comforting.

My hair air dryed with smooth bouncy curls.
Soft & light.
The next day I spiraled my curls with a flat iron for definition, still run your fingers through soft & no frizz.

A week later, with working 14 hour days
 & a quick dry shampoo for days 4,5 & 6,
 my hair is still soft, not weighed down & has bounce with some ""fluffing"" at the roots.

So, yes, it works & for the amount needed,
I understand the value in the price.
This bottle should last quite a bit.",1491264000,2017-04-04

It doe not leave my hair sticky or tacky.

With that in mind, In order to evaluate this product properly, I either purchased or requested through Vine, the other pieces.  ( Please see my review of the cleanser and radiant moisturizer in this MEG 21 line) I then used all three products faithfully twice a day, every day for 30 days.  I can tell you it works.  Your results may vary ( after my testing period I tended to lapse on the twice daily routine.).

5.0,"I've struggled with acne for years, as a teen, as well as an adult. In my experience, salicylic acid treatments work better on oily skin or teen acne, while adult acne (or more troublesome acne) is better treated by benzoyl peroxide. Because of my long history with these products, I didn't expect to be too impressed by this product because it is a salicylic acid treatment.

I get recurring acne on the left side of my face in a very localized area. Sometimes the acne will disappear for months, but it always comes back, and it usually lingers for awhile. When I started getting acne again after a long period of not having any, I decided to try this. I used it as a spot treatment on the few pimples that had popped up overnight. To my surprise, I only needed to apply it once, and the acne hasn't returned. I don't know if I would call it a miracle--perhaps I got lucky--but I am seriously impressed. Maybe it is the inclusion of hyaluronic acid that made the difference?

I have now been acne free for about a week. When my acne returns (because it always does) I will try this again, and if I don't have the same results, I will update this review.

If other acne sufferers are looking for an alternative or natural cure, I would like to mention that neem and zinc (in combination) have worked well for me in the cast.",1512604800,2017-12-07

1.0,"I love OPI's Nail Envy and have used it for several years.  So, why am I giving it 1-star?  Because it's hit-or-miss whether you'll get the same stuff each time you order this particular product.

The first time I bought it was from a salon and I was a fan from the start.  For the first time ever, I finally found a nail strengthener that really works for me and, best of all, STAYS ON!  I simply apply two coats of the Nail Envy, follow that with 1-2 coats of my nail laquer color of choice, and then top it with either a second coat of clear Nail Envy or OPI Top Coat.  It makes my nails stronger and longer then they've ever been, plus I can count on it to stay for 6-8 days before needing to strip off the layers and start over.

I've successfully ordered this from Amazon with positive results.  But, unfortunately, that's not always the case lately.  Sometimes it's a close match but just different enough in its performance that I question it.  My latest order gives me no doubt, though, despite arriving in its usual original-looking box/wrapping.  Counterfeit or a major change in OPI's formula, who knows?  But it's awful.  It doesn't stay on well at all and yellows horribly.

4.0,"First let's look at the Trinity device itself and then we'll get into the Eye and Lip Enhancer Attachment. The NuFACE Trinity makes a big promise: Use and you will see your skin plump and firm to reduce the signs of aging. Does it work? YES. Is it the easiest or most convenient product ever invented? NO. Read on.

Process: After washing your face, you will apply the gel primer to the areas you want to target. Because the gel dries very fast I break up my face into three treatment areas: forehead/brows, left side of face, right side of face. Following the 'beep' of the device, you glide the NuFACE over the area three times. There are many techniques you can use to do this. For example, your cheek/side of face is divided into three sections: along the jaw, in the hollows of your cheeks, and on your cheek bone. You glide over EACH area three times, slowly, in tune to the beep of the device. You can also use a hold technique where you leave the device in one place for the beep cycle. This is particularly effective on your nasolabial folds and for picking up your eyebrows. When you are finished you will wash the gel primer off with a warm wash-cloth. You can then apply moisturizer and either makeup (if using in AM) or night creams (if using in PM).

Results: You will see results instantly. I notice them most in my smile lines and in my brows/the 'elevens' between my eyes. Let me explain. The effect is two-fold. The lines are plumped so you no longer see the smile lines or the 'elevens'. There is also a slight paralysis effect in that you can smile and the lines don't come back. Very neat. I hate my down-turned brows. I have taught myself to constantly hold them up using my forehead muscles. The NuFACE creates the same result I get when holding my brows up. My brows easily stay up about a centimeter from where they would be in resting position. This makes me look more awake and less grumpy- definitely a plus!

Drawbacks:
-The biggest drawback is that the results are temporary. After about 6 hours your face is back to normal. Therefore if you want the results, you'll need to use everyday day and night which brings me to the second drawback...
-Time is a big issue. For a full treatment with optimal results, you need about 20-30 minutes. I find if I do a ""quickie"" the results aren't near as noticeable and fade quickly. If you have the time to spend an hour a day on your face, you'll have no issues. For those of us who need every minute of every day for work/life... it gets old even though the results are great. It's still a great investment for those nights out when you want to look fabulous. I actually first heard about the product in an ELLE magazine article about stylists and makeup artists who used it to prep celebrities before an award show so they would look younger and refreshed.
-I hate how the gel primer feels. It's similar to smearing your face with syrup or jelly. I just do not like the sensation. Then it is thick so you have to work it off with the washcloth.

ELE (Eye and Lip Enhancer) Attachment: I should state that I do not have smoker's lines on my lips and I do not yet have crow's feet. Perhaps if I had these types of lines I would have gotten more out of the ELE. That said, I do have awful tear trough lines and smile lines. I honestly did not notice a big difference when using the ELE attachment to target these areas and using the regular NuFACE. I experienced the same amount of lift and plump without having to switch out the device heads. Some of the YouTube tutorials I watched recommended using the ELE to really target your brows and I have to say I get much better lift using the original device on my brows than the ELE! Based on my experience, you really don't NEED the ELE unless perhaps you have smoker's lines or crow's feet.",1440892800,2015-08-30

5.0,"This was my first time using a long barrel curling iron, but since I have hair that goes all the way to my mid back and is also very thick, the extra length seemed perfect for me.

While I let the iron heat up, I sectioned my hair with alligator clips (so necessary to make my long, thick hair easier to manage and to make sure I don't miss a strand.)  Working in sections I sprayed my hair with hairspray (currently using Living Proof Style | Lab Flex Shaping Hairspray), let it dry then wrap a small section at a time around the barrel starting a few inches away from my scalp.  I then slowly slide the iron down to the ends of my hair, while rotating, so I can curl the full strand of hair.  (A stylist taught me to curl it this way so you can spend the least amount of time on the ends, which can be more fragile and damaged.)  I then spray with a bit more hair spray and repeat until I've done my whole head, piecing through the curls gently at the end to separate them and give a more natural look and will often spray my hair with a bit more hairspray.

Using that method and this iron, I think my hair turns out great.  I also think the slightly wider curl from the 1.25 inch iron works really well with my longer hair.  My hair looks flawless for hours (people often ask if I had it done), and I still have soft waves the next day.  Granted, my hair type is slightly coarse and naturally wavy/curly, so it tends to hold curls pretty well, your results may vary.

I also enjoy the experience of using this.  There's a good range of temperatures and I find even with my coarse hair I don't have to jack it up to the highest temperature to see results.  It also heats up really quickly.  And the longer barrel definitely makes quicker work of my long hair.  I also especially love the finger grip on the end.  None of my other curling irons have that and it makes it much, much easier to maneuver, as does the swivel cord.

The one thing I will say is that since it is longer than your average curling iron it felt a bit bulky at first and took a little time to adjust to, but after doing my hair a couple of times it felt completely normal.

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

5.0,"04/06/2016 UPDATE - almost 3 years now, the original jar is still about 40% full. I've since tried Proraso Green and Proraso Red, also love them. You can get them really cheap at Italian Barber website.

12/14/2015 UPDATE - Just a little observation: I've heard it before and then experienced it myself: this soap only works well in soft water. For a while my water softener was not working (due to a ""salt bridge"", resolved now) and I couldn't even use Proraso - it deflated after applying to face and was no good by second pass. I found that the Tabac stick works best for that. But after my soft water returned I tried it again yesterday and it was great. BTW, if you have hard water, you can just try using distilled water to lather your soap, that should work, can't get any softer than distilled :) Also need to make sure there's not too much water in the lather.

I switched from the cheap ""can spray"" foam, so I haven't tried many other high end shaving soaps and other products, but I am very pleased with Proraso (also had a bottle of aftershave lotion, but it was glass and I dropped it and it broke). The smell is exquisite, makes you feel like you're in a different income bracket ;) It tends to stay with you during the day, if you don't mask it with other fragrances, which is great!

So far I had a few friends try it and they were hooked.

Please don't cheat yourself and get a nice brush.

I used it with straight edge and more recently with double edge safety razor, but it's great even with cartridge razors (but please do yourself, your face and your budget a favor and switch to DE or straight edge).",1427846400,2015-04-01

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

5.0,"A little over ten years ago my stylist convinced me that it was time to switch to an ionic blow dryer.  I was a little skeptical  I was already using a name brand dryer, how much difference could an ionic dryer make?  All it took was one use to convert this doubting Thomas into an ionic evangelist  my hair was smoother with less frizz and static electricity.  After continued use the condition of my hair actually improved; it was shinier and healthier looking.

Ive owned three Bio Ionic brand dryers; this Power Light is my fourth.  I have a lot of confidence in this brand, and I love this particular dryer  its really top of the line.  It has the usual features (variable heat and power settings, a cool shot button, 9ft cord) and comes with two nozzles.  At just slightly over one pound its noticeably lightweight for a full size dryer.  Its expensive, but its professional quality and it delivers  I can get a fast, smooth, frizz-free blow out without damaging my hair.

This may sound funny, but blow drying your hair is a skill, and like any other skill it takes practice.  If you're like my sister and you just point the dryer in the general direction of your hair and hope for the best, then don't expect any miracles from this (or any other) dryer.  But if you use good styling products made specifically for your hair type and invest in a good quality brush, then this dryer can make the difference between just getting your hair dry and having it look like you just came from the salon.  If its in your budget then I say go for it  its a fantastic blow dryer and I highly recommend it.

**Note:  The filter is easy to clean, and youll want to do so frequently.  A clogged filter can make the dryer overheat, and can even shorten the life of the dryer.",1475798400,2016-10-07
3.0,"This hair dryer is powerful and can produce enough heat to burn.  It has 5 different heat setting and 5 different fans settings that give you 25 unique combinations.  With that many combinations there is a setting that is perfect for every type of hair.  The dryer is also light and ergonomic.  Most of the dryers weight is centered about the handle which makes it very easy to hold and use.

But (and this is a huge BUT) the digital display and the controls on this thing are just down-right wacky.  The color-coded display is particularly strange because it is linked to the fan speed and not the temperature.  When you increase the fan speed the color of the display cycles from yellow/tan to green to blue to orange to red, but when you increase the temperature using the heat control buttons the color of the display does not change.  IDK, but this seems backwards.  You should get the red display warning when the temperature is maxed out not when the fan speed is maxed out.

Even the instruction manual highlights the strangeness of the color-coding.  Page 7 gives the temperature ranges of the different colors as:

Yellow  99 F to 205 F
Green - 111 F to 212 F
Blue  108 F to 219 F
Orange  106 F to 230 F
Red  122 F to 241 F

With such large and overlapping ranges the colors have no meaning with regards to temperature.  A more accurate table would read:

Fan Speed 1  Yellow  possible temperature ranges: 99 F to 205 F
Fan Speed 2  Green  possible temperature ranges:  111 F to 212 F
Fan Speed 3  Blue  possible temperature ranges:  108 F to 219 F
Fan Speed 4  Orange  possible temperature ranges: 106 F to 230 F
Fan Speed 5  Red  possible temperature ranges:  122 F to 241 F

So nice hair dryer that can be customized to handle any type of hair, but the digital display still needs some work.

PS: some tricks to using the controls that the instruction manual does not tell you about.
Press and hold the MAX Fan button for 2 seconds to switch from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Press and hold the MIN Temperature button for 2 seconds to quickly reset to the lowest fan and temperature setting.

That being said, I was amazed at how well the LA ROCHE-POSAY looked on my skin and how smooth it went on.  I have used liquid and powder foundations, but I have never used a cream foundation before.  I squeezed a little on my finger and it stayed in place until I put it on my face. I really like that a lot. It had medium coverage. When I think of light coverage, I think of some skin showing through the make-up and when I think of thick coverage, I think of all blemishes and dark spots completely covered. This make-up went on very creamy, good coverage, and looked smooth and nice on my skin.  I got the Light Beige color and found that it blended perfectly with my skin.

It's not revolutionary and will smell familiar to most men, without being overwhelming like so many of today's body sprays. It's soapy and spicy and I actually really liked it. It had sort of a retro Old Spice-Zest Clean scent to it that doesn't scream HE'S WEARING COLOGNE! Just light, cool and fresh and, to my nose anyway, altogether pleasant.

At two squirts in the morning, I liked that I could smell it on him if I was within hugging distance even at the end of the day, but not from across the room. Definitely something I'd be happy to have my husband wearing regularly. He said he liked it to, and actually got a few compliments throughout the day and I've noticed he's used it several times since.

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

5.0,"First off, if you've never used a micellar water/solution before , I strongly recommend giving them a shot. Micellar waters are a soap free non-rinse cleansing solution that gently and effectively removes makeup, dirt, and other debris on the skin by using micelle molecules that, when applied to the skin, encapsulates debris within the molecules which removes it from the skin without stripping and irritating even the most sensitive skin. It's all very scientific. There's a slew of information that you can find on micelle molecules and how they work.

Micellar solutions can be used in a number of ways ( i.e. a makeup remover, toner, cleanser) and working them into your skin care routine can really save you a lot of time.

After using a whole bottle of the pink version (which is for normal and sensitive skin) I decided to try this green version out (for oily and combination skin) when I needed to reorder because within the last year my skin has become excessively more oily in my T-zone and chin, yet exceptionally dry everywhere else. I really wanted to see what, if any, difference there was between the two.

Since I still had a few applications worth in the pink bottle I decided to do a side by side comparison for a few days by using the pink version on one side of my face and using the green on the other. I typically use my micellar solution to remove my makeup and prep my skin for washing and cleansing with either my Murad Time Release Acne and Ant-Aging cleanser, or my Caudalie foaming cleanser. If I'm feeling particularly too lazy/tired, or if I'm not wearing any makeup I'll use it on its own.

Both perform the same at successfully removing makeup and dirt, however I found that I had to use more of the pink solution than the green to achieve my desired results. Both are similarly gentle and refreshing and remove eye makeup without struggle or irritation, but again it seemed like the green removed more more quickly than the pink. The pink does tingle more than the green. If you use these solutions you know what I'm talking about. For those of you that don't, I say ""tingle"" because it's the only word I can think of to describe the sensation. It is not a burning, menthol, or medicated type of tingling. It's not uncomfortable or irritating by any means and is more strongly felt in more sensitive areas or areas that are more clogged than others. Also, it stops pretty quickly and is not felt once the solution has evaporated. I'm assuming that this tingle sensation is in part linked to the encapsulation of debris by the molecules before evaporation. If you've ever eaten Pop Rocks, imagine a gentler, much less extreme version of that sensation on your skin.

In my side by side comparison I noticed that the side on which I used the green solution stayed grease-free longer than that of the pink. The green side also feels less taught after drying than the pink. Although, I hadn't noticed any tightness in feeling with the pink version before trying the green and comparing, so the difference is slight yet enough to notice.

The pink version is clear, however the green is light blue in color. The ingredients are significantly different. I won't list them all here but I will point out that the pink version has cucumber extract whereas the green has ginkgo biloba extract instead. The green seems to have more ingredients than the pink and is NOT fragrance free like the pink one...BUT despite the fact the pink does not have any ADDED fragrance, it does have a smell. The pink version definitely smells stronger than the fragrance of the green. Oddly enough, the green smells like cucumber and rose. The fragrance of the green version is so slight it's almost unnoticeable upon application which causes me to believe it is included to either counteract any scent caused by an ingredient the pink version does not have, or for those who don't like the way the pink one smells. The pink has a slight tinge of chemical smell but primarily (and this is just what it smells like to me and the best way I can describe it) it smells like dirt. Yep. Dirt. Literal earth. Almost the way dirt smells after it rains. It's not horrible or overly offensive to me personally, it's just much stronger.

If you're trying to choose between the two, the added fragrance and the smell of each might be a big determining factor.

Another pro for the green is that I paid almost $10 less for the bigger bottle (500 ml) than I ended up paying for the smaller (250 ml) bottle of the pink. I realize this is relative and depends on sellers, availability, and location (the 250ml pink bottle was purchased at $34 before shipping from over sea's).

Do I like one more than the other? Not really, although, I think the green version suits my personal skin needs better than the other at this point in time. They both are exceptional at what they do. Micellar solutions have become an integral part of my beauty regiment. These bottles last quite awhile and have removed my need to buy cleansing wipes and other makeup removers, which tend to break me out eventually.

I hope this review was helpful to those trying to decide which product is right for you. Everyone's skin and needs are different and to say ""this ones better"" or ""that ones better"" as a blanket statement doesn't really help anyone make an informed choice, IMO.",1411603200,2014-09-25
4.0,"This is a surprisingly light serum, light enough to wear every day as well as at night, although it contains no SPF, so you'd want to layer that on. No discernible annoying scent and lovely packaging. My skin feels soft & supple after use.

4.0,Love this color. As another reviewer mentioned the polish is a bit thin and watery. I used a white coat prior to applying and then 3 coats to get the desired full color. It looks great. Just make sure to use a white base coat and multiple coats to acheive the full color.,1405900800,2014-07-21

When I found out that this brand does not contain alcohol, I decided to give it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  While there is a fragrance, I did not find it overwhelming.  Best of all, the product did not dry my skin nor did it cause my sensitive skin any other issues.

After I've applied and rinsed off Crepe Erase, my skin easily absorbs moisturizer. But will I pay upwards of $20 to buy another tube when this one is empty? I'm not sure.

5.0,"I have never used a peel before, and really enjoyed this product. The smell is not great, but it's not terrible either -- a slight hint of apple, but not really fresh. Still, not a deal breaker. There is a bit of a slimy feel to it, it goes on smooth, and almost immediately begins to tingle, which worried me at first, but ultimately this didn't seem to be an indication that anything was wrong. By the time the recommended ten minutes had elapsed the peel had hardened a bit. It washed off like a masque. (Is a peel supposed to peel off?)

All that aside, afterward my skin felt great -- clean and smooth, very pleasant. Even the next day my skin feels great.

3.0,"After using this product for a month, I noticed maybe a little bit of a difference in the wrinkles on my forehead but nothing to write home about. There was only a small amount of serum and it didn't last nearly as long as the other products. The night cream did not work well without using the serum first - it left my skin tight and dry. Also, the serum had orange gel bubble things in it. Sometimes part of them would come out with the serum, sometimes not. I'm not sure what the purpose of them was, but whatever it was, they weren't distributed evenly. I did like the exfoliating scrub. My skin felt refreshed after using it. This is not a skin care set I would purchase on my own.",1525564800,2018-05-06

4.0,"The Vichy Proeven Night Cream is a nice night time use serum for helping even out dark spots and even out general skin tone. The bottle I received is relatively small - 1.3 fl oz - when doing a thin mask, just a little of the cream is enough to spread across your face, but the instructions suggest a heavier mask twice a week - which would eat up this bottle pretty quickly. The serum goes on lightly and does not feel greasy - the scent doesn't really remind me of anything specific, just a general chemical / cosmetic smell.  I wouldn't call it bad or good really, just there.

The cream worked well I think, for evening out skin tone, but I haven't seen much improvement in spot reduction - I think it might take a little longer than the suggested 2 to 4 weeks to really see any large shade lightening.",1445990400,2015-10-28

The packaging certain doesn't justify the price, since it has the look and feel of a drugstore product, but my review isn't about the packaging. Initially, I thought the cream was a bit heavy and thick. However, is absorbed well and I've used it under make-up even though I prefer to use a primer under make-up.

The reason for my 4* review is that I actually could feel my skin tighten slightly and my skin has better texture when I wear this than when I don't. The results can be felt. Are they visible results? Not to me.",1416614400,2014-11-22

2.0,"My husband often uses a hair gel to keep his hair in place and  to keep it looking neat. His hair isn't very long, just enough to get messed up. He is always willing to try different hair products and thought this might be a good one. He was mostly disappointed with this one, mainly because it didn't do a good job of holding his hair. The scent was kind of citrusy and a little strong, but that would have been okay because it disappates rather quickly. I thought it smelled pretty good. But in order to get this gel to hold his hair he had to use a lot, enough that it gunked up his hair and made it feel dirty. So we really can't recommend this one.

The company apparently made another gel prior to this that people liked. It sounds like they should have stuck with the old formula. All too often companies try to improve on a popular product and change some of the very things that made it popular for ingredients that don't perform as well.",1441843200,2015-09-10

Very nice scent throw! It burns fairly clean with minimal amount of ""mushrooming"" of the wick. I had my own candle business for several years and do know a bit about what makes a good candle.

4.0,"Have had persistent skin issues for a while now with irritated patches and scaliness on sides of face.  So picked up this cream - actually it is something between a cream and a lotion - to calm my face and make it more comfortable.  This is why this works for me:

  o  no redness or reaction upon application;
  o  aloe vera gel listed as second ingredient (main ingredient);
  o  jojoba oil;
  o  avocado oil; and
  o  shea butter.

Also many organic ingredients included as well:  ginger root, rice bran extract and green tea.  If there is a fragrance, this nose fails to detect it.  Must note, however, being VERY dry don't find this adequate as a moisturizer, however.  Also, labeling suggests using this as a night cream, but hydration offered is not on a par with night creams which are usually heavier and more oily.  To amp up, mixed it with some olive oil - say 4-5 drops, and that really did the trick.

Definitely think this works to calm your face, which is a great for all those guys with post shave irritation.",1413763200,2014-10-20

Dry spots around my nose and chin stayed hydrated and happy all day without making a reappearance after just a few hours. I love the mirror lid too. Its handy for when you're applying the product on the go and aren't near a mirror.

It works well, lasts well, doesn't smear, smudge or raccoon eye. Why the poor rating? It arrived virtually dried out, and the price is outrageous, considering it was made in China! It is higher than the Japanese brands. Worse, the Bliss company couldn't have been less helpful in rectifying this problem.

5.0,"I went through a major hair shed a couple of years ago, which was when I got my first Toppik Fibers. This product has helped preserve my vanity by hiding my widening part and other thin spots on my head. Toppik blends in so nicely and stays put until your next wash. I don't use the spray nozzle attachment, I just sprinkle it on and pat it out to blend in, as they demonstrate in the video on Toppik's website.

I've never seen residue on my clothing or pillowcase (however, fine dust does fly everywhere when applying it, so get dressed AFTER application!). The stuff doesn't even bleed out after a tough, sweaty workout either. As far as the colors, after some trial and error, I mostly use medium brown, which is more of a dark than a golden brown shade. I've also tried light brown, but that shade is more of a dark ash blonde and I had to blend the medium and light to make it work. I ended up dyeing my hair a little darker so I can stick to the medium brown and keep things simple.

The only negative is that the fine dust settles on my white bathroom counters after application, but is easily cleaned up. Right now Amazon has the best price on this product, costing $10 less than at beauty supply stores. I've also tried Caboki, which for me was of inferior quality, lasting power and had a funny rubber-like smell (Toppik has no scent whatsoever).",1373587200,2013-07-12
4.0,"Iluminage Precise Touch Permanent Hair Remover seems to work, at least by thinning unwanted hair.  The device is easy to use.  First you shave the area you want the hair growth to slow from.  It should be noted that this product is not intended for facial hair removal on men.  It can be used on a male or female body, and certain areas of a woman's face, but not on a man's face.  So I am assuming it won't work on course hair.  The instructions do not say that, but I am putting two and two together here.

You use  the device  once a week for 6 weeks, which ends up being 7 treatments.  So again, shave the area you want hair growth to slow on.  Choose your setting preference  on the device.  Making sure the two silver RF bars  touch your skin, move slowly across the area of skin you are targeting. so the lights flash over the area you trying to rid of unwanted hair.  Just keep the device moving, do not stop.  You can glide over the area 2 or 3 times per treatment, but apparently no more.  Female facial treatments are a bit different, as the area you are trying to rid of hair is smaller.  So you are to use a stamping motion with the light, again 2 or 3 times for a treatment.

The device doesn't promise  100% hair removal, but 94% over the course of 6 weeks.  My husband is noticing a less hair growth on his back (yes,  his back), which is a good thing.  A very good thing.  Beach goers around the world will thank you next summer.

So from what I understand from research on this item, it is made to have 150,000 pulses, and then won't work anymore.  That's a lot of pulses.  Probably more than we will use in our lifetime.  The only reason I mention this is that it may not be good for someone trying to use it in a business, using it on lots of people.  But 150,000 is a lot of pulses. For the money, it's worth buying a new one if you burn this one out. FYI and food for thought.

We'll give this to my hairy daughter when she comes home from college for the holidays.  She's obsessed with hair on her arms, and already shaves them.  I'll make a follow up post to update readers on how this works for her.",1448064000,2015-11-21

The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.

5.0,"Okay, here is what how you use this product: Do not peel off the sticky film under the lid, instead use a matte knife to cut out a triangle shaped piece, so that the film looks like a pizza with one big slice missing. Then not so much will come out and you will have better control and it will last much longer. You do not shake it on to the roots of your hair where you can see the scalp, you tap it gently, moving it where you can see your scalp. If you shake it near your front hairline, you may have to wipe a dusting off your forehead with a tissue, but it comes right off.

I use this every day and it makes a huge difference, plus it bulks up the roots of your hair.

It is not for someone with a lot of baldness, more for thinning hair and where you can see your scalp.

Make sure to get the right color, too light and it will do nothing, too dark and it will look odd, but better too dark than light.

Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!",1395360000,2014-03-21

3.0,"The best thing about this is the fragrance, which I can't identify, but seems like fruit or something in nature.  I t has a nice creamy texture, which you apply while your hair is still damp.  I do have fine hair, about 5 inches past my shoulders. When they say light hold, don't think it really has any, not for longer hair, anyway.  Other than the fragrance and ease in comb-out, I don't see any difference using this.",1467936000,2016-07-08
5.0,I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.,1467331200,2016-07-01
4.0,This polish is hard to get despite its popularity for the last 3/4 years. That is why a purchase two bottles in case this color will be discontinue (which I hope not). Its the real Essie polish.

5.0,"Living in the South, you really need a good primer to set your foundation or you will sweat it off within a few minutes of stepping out in the heat and humidity.  I have used DHC Velvet Coat, Clarins Beauty Balm and the Body Shop Vitamin C as primers.

I like that this has a SPF in it.  The consistency was thin and I did have my doubts about use.  But it went on like a regular moisturizer but it quickly smoothed over my skin.  I've used this with powder foundation and cream.  This primer kept both intact and even though I did sweat from the car to the office, there was no loss of coverage.

The one thing I didn't like is the application.  I'm used to a pump and this has a top and the opening twists.  Just an oddity to look out for.",1469318400,2016-07-24

4.0,"I used to love to get professional manicures every week.  But alas, my nails paid the price.  I now occasionally do my own nails and I'm always looking for new nail polish colors to try.
I'm usually more of a traditional color gal, give me pink or red any day.

This nail polish is well, very black.  I guess if I were into gothic or something, I would like it better.  That is why I only gave it four stars.

The good stuff about this nail polish:
* It goes on very smoothly and with just the right amount of thickness.  I think it would last a while on your nails.

* It is without some of the usual harsh chemicals found in nail polish.  It doesn't have: formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin camphor, dibutyl phthalate, or toluene.

* The interesting names.  Each polish is named after an airport.

I like another reviewer's idea of applying this polish over another color.  It sounds as though you get some interesting patterns.

If you like black nail polish that is high quality, you will like this polish.",1433203200,2015-06-02

Although I've only been using the Toleraine cleanser for a few days, I really like it!

This has no smell to it, and is very soothing to sensitive skin.  It goes on as a milky cream, and you only need a small amount, so this bottle should last a really long time.

It rinses off easily, but since it doesn't seem to clean foundation very well, I use another cleanser beforehand on days when I wear makeup, and then this afterwards, in the Japanese ""double cleansing"" model.

I'm impressed with La Roche-Posay's products, and this is another nice one!",1396656000,2014-04-05
5.0,Midnight Swim is a standout for fall.  It goes on almost black but it is a deep dark blue.  This was my first step into the darker colors and I'm loving it.  It has the same attributes of other CND colors.  As another reviewer mentioned be careful and take your time when applying the dark colors.  Mistakes show up more.  Have your alcohol handy for cleanup to make ti look crisp and neat.  The magic happens when light hits this color.  Highly recommended.,1350518400,2012-10-18

5.0,"As with other Dermablend covers that I have tried, a very, very little of the product goes a very, very long way. The instructions recommend that you put a spot of it on the back of your hand and work the product to warm and loosen it; I think this is very good advice as the product really sticks to the first spot you put it on (including the back of your hand). The cover is 100% and still let's your skin look like skin. It is also water-proof, sweat-proof and practically soap-proof. It's really hard to get it off of skin (especially the back of your hand). Both the Reddish Tan and Toasted Brown can be used as a dark contour, even if your skin is pretty dark. I love how the Reddish Tan looks like dark suntan. There is no scent and I haven't had any breakouts or skin sensitivity, although I tend to have pretty tough skin and don't usually have any problems.",1499558400,2017-07-09
3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

4.0,"This Dermablend Intense Powder Camo Medium to Full Coverage Foundation Makeup with Matte Finish has been my regular foundation for the past 3 years and I'm still happy with it.

This is a powder foundation but it has more pigment in it than Bare Essentials so it gives better coverage, IMO. It blends out skin discolorations quite well and doesn't seem to get cakey if you apply it for medium coverage, as I do.

Although Dermablend says it is buildable, I find it makes my skin oily and it settles in creases if I apply it heavily so I would not suggest this particular product for people with oily skin that need full coverage. Dermablend has other foundations that work better in that instance.

This comes in a nice compact with a good mirror and a sponge applicator. It's easy to apply and stays on all day if I use a primer first.",1497571200,2017-06-16

It has a sandlewood cinnamon spice odor without perfume overtone. The alcohol base burns off quickly leaving a mild warm masculine scent, the warmer the skin the deeper the scent. Doesn't overpower the room and makes you want to get closer to the person wearing it. Each person's own body chemistry can alter final smell, I suggest trying in store sample to see if it will work for yours.",1458000000,2016-03-15

I use a soft cotton wash cloth to clean off,  use warm water to soak and wash away, it does take more work than others to clean off. The best way is to rinse off is in the shower.

The serum is a bit sticky so I use it before I go to bed so that it works during the night. It helps with redness and I noticed that when I feel swelling or inflammation, with a blemish that hasn't reached the surface yet, it reduces the tenderness and redness which I love. When I use it at night it takes the tenderness away and I can see that the blemish doesn't come up. If i have some inflammation in the morning I will apply a small amount on the problem area under my makeup. Like I said it has a bit of a sticky texture but it doesn't get to sticky if you use a small amount under makeup. Overall great product.",1453852800,2016-01-27
5.0,"For many years I have been in search of a quality, compact grooming kit.  Over the years I have had kits given to me as gifts, and have purchased kits myself, but all have been the typical Chinese junk one finds at the local discount stores.  For a long time I have had to settle for nice nail clippers made in Japan, which I really like, but I have still lacked the nice matched set I've wanted.  So when I received the opportunity to review the Zwilling J.A. Henckels grooming set I got very excited.  The set arrived in today's mail and was perfect timing as my nails have very much been in need of a trim, and I have been waiting for the set to arrive.

First off, this is not just over-priced junk.  This is a very precision-engineered grooming set manufactured by the same company known for its premium chef knives.  This grooming set falls in that same category of quality craftsmanship where you get what you pay for.  So before fainting at the price keep in mind you are paying for very high quality.

The set arrives in a nice box for gifting, and the grooming tools are neatly arranged in a stylish, thick leather case with a zipper closure.  There are only 5 tools in the set, but the case is overly large and has extra slots in it that lead me to believe it was designed to hold additional tools (a comb and/or razor, perhaps?).  Each tool has its own slot with the longer file and cuticle pusher needing to be kept at the edges of the case or it won't close.  The case is a bit bulky for this grooming set, but the leather is very nice and no doubt contributes to some of the high cost of this set.

The nail clippers are very unique and frustrated me at first.  Unlike other clippers, these are designed to fold completely flat for storage and arrive that way.  To open them you must gently pull back on the top half of the clipper (there is a small ribbed area on it to give you a surface to pull it backward with) which allows the two pieces to separate a little bit.  This is where I got initially frustrated as the tool will not clip or work properly without taking the additional step of lifting the back end of the upper clipper upward and then pushing it forward to lock it into a clipping position.  I don't know if the one I received had a stuck spring or if I just didn't use it correctly at first, but once I figured it out I had no problems using the clipper.  The manufacturer really should provide a little instruction sheet with this set as I have no doubt many have been frustrated thinking the clipper was useless from not knowing how to open it correctly.  The clippers are so lightweight and frail-feeling that I was afraid they might break easily, but I quickly found that very little force is needed for them to precisely cut my nails.  And when I say cut, I mean cut.  These have very precise and sharp edges that cut the nail off with absolutely no jagged edges or tearing like ordinary clippers.  Even the fine Japanese nail clippers I own do not cut this easily and precisely.  After clipping my nails I found little need for usage of the nail file, although the file in this kit is equally nice and works great.

The scissors in this kit are also remarkable in their precision and sharpness.  The rounded tip makes them very safe for trimming eyebrows, nose hairs, and hair that always seems to grow out of men's ears as we get older.  There is nothing particularly special about the cuticle pusher/nail cleaner or tweezers.  They have the same look and feel as the other tools in the set, but for my purposes won't see that much use.  In a perfect world, for the cost involved, it seems like a small stainless steel comb should have been included in this set.

Overall, this is a very fine grooming set.  I would say this is what I have had in mind in my years of searching for a quality groomng set.  The cost of this set will not be appealing or likely appropriate for many men, but for the man who appreciates quality and wants a nice grooming set to stay well-groomed this Zwilling J.A. Henckels grooming set is definitely worth its cost.",1432857600,2015-05-29
4.0,"I got this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  This product does a great job covering my under eye dark circles and blends out nicely.  I do have to set it with a transparent powder or it creases.

The product is a bit thick in consistency for me; I really like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/bareMinerals-Stroke-of-Light-Eye-Brightener/dp/B008XCNJ0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">bareMinerals Stroke of Light Eye Brightener</a>&nbsp;better.  Stroke of Light just feels lighter going on, blends easier, and hides just as well.

I do have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any irritation for me.

I will mention a couple things about packaging that I did not like.  First of all this comes wrapped in plastic that has a perforation down the side so that you can get the plastic off...I could not get the plastic off of concealer stick.  It would not tear, I ended up having to take a knife and cut down the side through the plastic...it was such a pain.

Second this concealer has a brush applicator on the end.  The brush bristles are pretty stiff and they hurt when I used them under my eye.  I ended up brushing product onto my finger and then applying under my eyes with my fingers.  Additionally the brush gets kind of goopy with dried product over time which I don't like.

Overall this product worked well but wasn't my favorite.  It covers well and has decent staying power as long as you set it with powder.  However it felt a bit thick to me.  Additionally I really didn't like the brush applicator; it was too stiff to use in sensitive facial areas (under my eyes).  I will use this batch of it but probably won't be buying again.

4.0,"La Roche Posay is noted for their quality skin products. Substiane Visible Density and Volume is designed to help restore skin's elasticity, bounce and sagginess. As skin ages it becomes thinner. This product claims to plump up the volume and restore a more youthful feel. The product contains two ingredients that work together; Pro-Xylane for density and LR2412 which bolsters the Pro-Xylane.

Though this product can be used alone, mature skin will likely want to use it in tandem with other anti-aging products. Personally I wish they would have combined this with an anti-wrinkle product to keep things simple. But they didn't.

You only need a small amount of this - a dab according to their website, to smooth over the skin. I like the hygienic bottle. The product has a slight plastic smell to me but it's very faint. It feels good going on and my skin appears slightly smoother on application. I will see how the results are over time.",1483488000,2017-01-04

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass.

I was a bit wary of the dewy side because it feels like lip gloss on your fingers when you touch the product. However, it goes on smoothly and doesn't feel like it's sitting on top of your skin or anything. It adds a nice flush that's not too dramatic, and it's a great highlighter for when you want a subtle sort of glow. The mattifying side didn't do as much for me, though, because my skin doesn't tend to get oily unless the weather is hot. It works all right as a pore minimizer, but I personally didn't find a lot of use for it. I can see it being great on oilier skin, though. On both sides, the color is very subtle, just a slight blush that worked quite well on my fair skin.",1447891200,2015-11-19
3.0,"This Oribe Flexible Finish Cream is just okay in doing anything for my hair.  I used a small amount of product and rubbed it in my hands to distribute it more evenly in my hair.  It helps tame my hair and make it a little piecey but I still needed to use my hairspray to get my flyaways to lay down and to also hold my styled hair.  The smell isn't horrible but the package is very old fashioned looking.  It looks like a container that you would have found a cold cream in in the 60s.  I don't hate this product but for what it does there are other, better products out there.",1491696000,2017-04-09
5.0,"This product comes form the Obagi Professional care skin care line and it is unique in what is has to offer.  It is an SPF cream with vitamin C.  One never sees skin care companies create a product that combine these two ingredients in one product.  In the past I always had to use SPF cream separately nd layer it to my vitamin C serum, but this product is an exception  The ingredient list is as following:  Active ingredients: Avobenzone 3% (sunscreen), Homosalate 8% (sunscreen), Octisalate 5% (sunscreen), Octocrylene 2.79% (sunscreen), Oxybenzone 3% (sunscreen), Inactive ingredients: ascorbic acid, citrus grandis (grapefruit) peel extract, fragrance.  I mean how many types of sunscreen ingredients can one ask for?  This product will definitely provide multiple benefits to the skin.  The only catch may be for people with sensitive skin (and i am not one of them).  Thsi product contains fragrance so if one is llergic to fragrance that may be a deal breaker.  But if the light fragrance is not oyur concern, thsi is a must have product on your shelf for daily daytime skin care routine.",1485648000,2017-01-29

4.0,"I'm a male 35 male with normal hair that has thinned a bit as I've aged, but I' not balding or anything. My hair isn't real thick anymore though. I got a sample of this conditioner (the older product Moisture Scentsation. I liked it so much I had to buy this 33 ounce big bottle of conditioner and shampoo! The conditioner is slightly less potent than the previous product it replaced Moisture Scentsation, but with all the  extra amount you get for the cheaper price, you can still get the same effect by using a bit more conditioner.

It smells super minty and makes your head tingle, love it. The best part is when you dry your hair it falls perfectly with no residue on it. Other conditioners made my hair feel and look weighed down like it was coated too heavily, but not this stuff. It is awesome and worth every penny!

I would have given this a 5 star review if it were just as good as potent as the conditioner it replaced, the abba Moisture Scentsation, but it is still great.

Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow dry!

One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you're not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.

I have terrible coffee breath. This cleanser is refreshing and has just the faintest of scents. I can't decide if it's citrus or roses because the scent is almost not there, but I love it. My dry yucky morning face looks and feels better without having to fool around with soap, water, or moisturizer.

My 21 year old son isn't that keen on this scent, and neither is my husband. Let's just say we'd all choose a different cologne over Burberry Touch, however, none of us thought it was offensive or abhorrent.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19

The bottle itself is quite beautiful and small and compact can go with you everywhere. I've been using this for 3 weeks so far and I most definitely noticed a change. My skin is clearer (less acne) and much softer, also the dry skin i get on occasion has been non existent.

I would highly recommend this serum, it's a great value for the price.",1467072000,2016-06-28
4.0,"When my husband first put this fragrance on, it was so strong I could smell it from across the room. It lightened very quickly getting progressively more mellow.  After about half an hour, it was something that I could smell when I was standing close to him but nothing overpowering.

The scent is very spicy in nature.  I'm not familiar with the scent of fresh tobacco, so I cannot attest to that fragrance.  It reminds me of the scent I would expect in a nightclub or men's fashion store.

While other women might easily wear this scent, I prefer lighter fragrances with floral or clean notes. While I would not wear it myself, after the initial mellowing phase, I enjoy my husband wearing the cologne.",1474329600,2016-09-20
5.0,"This Jouer Peony gloss looks very bright in the bottle, but it goes on very nicely with a great shine and doesn't look like the bright pink in the bottle. It is much more subtle and pretty.

I like it too and the Peony color looks great on all three of us which is very cool because we all have different skin tones.

I love the compact container and it fits nicely in my purse and its a pretty little bottle. The sponge applicator makes it easy to swipe on and go. It's the perfect Spring color and makes lips shine and the peony, tho it looks bright is actually a nice tinge of color without being over powering.",1399334400,2014-05-06

I found this very easy to apply and even after applying translucent powder over the blush, I could still see the color on my cheeks.  The blush is silky and stays on all day.  There's not much in this compact at 6.5 grams (0.229 ounces) so it will last me about two months. Overall, I like this makeup.",1415059200,2014-11-04

I like that I can build on top of it and have that flawless blend that I have always sought after with my makeup but have not been able to obtain until now. This particular stick matched amazingly with my own skin tones and blended in just as well. It is so easy to apply. You just open by twisting the top and you squeeze some out on a finger or a sponge and apply like you would any other makeup. SO I got one that did match my skin tones and the coverage is AMAZING, The concealer sticks along with the smooth camo foundation covers all my blemishes and skin irritants flawlessly. That really helps boost a girls self esteem when she can look in the mirror and her cystic acne is being well covered, Dermablend is created by certified dermatologist which is great because they know how to keep irritants out of the makeup they are creating, My skin doesn't breakout like it does with supermarket makeup when I use the Dermablend, I couldn't ask for a better makeup line to have fallen in love with.",1501632000,2017-08-02

The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.

I'm an early to bed and early to rise girl, so I don't have ""party into the wee hours of the morning"" types of dark circles around my eyes, so the dark circles I battle may not be the same as the ones you fight.  One thing I can say about this product is I am blown away by the cooling applicator!  At first I thought ""this is just a tapered applicator for dispensing the product"".

I find this to be one of the best lip products I've ever used. I have an entire drawer full of lipsticks. And this is hands down the best matte formula I've used. Hoping they make more colors, particularly nudes.

Staying power is definitely strong. I work 12+ hours and I only touch up once in my shift (after I eat lunch). Lasts through drinking coffee and water but any greasy foods will remove it. After I ate I could have gotten away without a touch up because it was only worn off in the center and my lips were slightly stained there.

2.0,"I have looked all over for the glove and can't find it. I checked inside the packaging twice. Is there a secret compartment on the handle that holds the glove that I can't find? Meanwhile, I don't see why they could not have put a few spikes on this to hold the hair in place rather than make you wear a glove and then change the glove hand to do the other side of your head. That's a lot of work. But I can see this is how all the female commentators on Fox News end up with those spirals of hair on their shoulders. I am concerned that none of the other reviews say theirs came without a glove.

This is very expensive for what it does. Couldn't you just twist a regular curling iron around the ends of your hair?

Meanwhile, if it touches your face -- and that's not hard to do when you are trying to twist the hair on the side of your head around it -- you burn your face. A few spikes would have served as a buffer between your skin and the hot rod.",1518134400,2018-02-09

It has always been frustrating to buy a hair dryer with a so-called cool setting to only find out that it gets warm.  When on cool this stays cool!  I love it!  Granted it takes a lot longer to dry ones hair using a cool setting, but personally I think it's more than worth it. The attachments are very easy to use & switch out.  Just make sure you line up the little marks on the attachment with the marks on the hair dryer & you are good to go!  It even includes a little Velcro wrap to keep the cord tidy.

She said it foamed up when she used it, which was unexpected. The scent is super strong; no subtlety here. She wasn't a fan of it, but that is always up to personal preference.

I received the rose quad for review and since I am dark-haired with light complexion, this quad of colors is perfect for me. I applied it yesterday morning for church and I was amazed at how much darker the colors were, even the lighter ones. You can really see them. And I didn't have to reapply them once. After church, I had to take my kids to camp and the color stayed on, even when it was humid out.

It is not greasy. It is not cake-like. It is actually a nice set of tinted powder that stayed on. It did emphasize the fine lines in my eyes, but will add primer to my eyes to take care of the lines. (I will apply it before putting the powder on.) What I really like about this is how the colors made my dark eyes stand out. It makes me feel feminine.

The only thing I did not like was how there were no applicator brush with it. Fortunately, I had some here but for the price of this eye shadow, I think an applicator should be included as well. That is my only complaint. Other than that, I love it.",1468195200,2016-07-11

3.0,"It's true, these really don't meet the quality you would expect for the price. They aren't the worst (the worst being those generic giant palettes sold in drugstores, especially around holidays), but they are about average drugstore quality. The color selection is beautiful for the most part, so for people who prefer a light touch and/or are willing to use a primer for the shadows, this might be a nice collection. For medium or darker skin tones, a couple of the blushes will be invisible. The glosses are nice, although the common cited fallout is a potential issue, especially since you have to work the eyeshadows a bit to get enough for a good payoff.

The travel case is key to this being practical, since the main tray is quite large.

In sum, if you are accustomed to highly pigmented shadows, you'll find this disappointed. If you prefer more sheer products, this might be a nice collection of very wearable shades.",1419292800,2014-12-23

The lotion is probably my favorite product. It smells great (as do the rest of the products) and provides a nice sealant for post-bath moisture, or even as a pick-me-up. The bubble bath is my least favorite. The bubbles are weak, quickly fade, and leave a rather odd film behind on skin that requires more kid-rinsing than I prefer. The cleanser is respectable, though I like a little going a long way and I'm just not seeing it here. Still, it rinses well leaving hair noticeably clean.

 Short length of treatment: one minute, just before bedtime (recommended)
The light on the device tells you when to stop treatment  goes from green to purple then stops
 Wrinkles are less noticeable but still visible, but overall it seems to be working.  I will update this review after the recommended 8 weeks and let you know.

CONS:
 You have to be very careful using it around your eyes.  The instruction warn that the laser can cause problems with vision if held too close, like to the eyes or eyelids. Yikes!
 Dont use if pregnant  which is ok, since the device seems made for older, postmenopausal women
 It's not meant for people who have darker skin - according to the instructions, the laser can cause redness on dark skin.
 I can't use this if I've just had a botox treatment or any other professional cosmetic treatments"", like skin peels, etc).  Unfortunately, the instructions are unclear about how long you should wait  I assume after the effects wear off?!
 Effects are meant to be TEMPORARY.  The instructions say you can only use it for 8 weeks straight (7 days a week), but it doesn't say anything about how long you can wait between treatments, or if the device is even reusable after 8 weeks.  If not, you're basically paying over $200 for a device that you can only use ONCE.
 The instructions are confusing.  The study they mention say that results were best after 8 weeks, with a slight decrease after 12 weeks, even though the device is not meant to be used after 8 weeks straight.  I assume it means the treatment keeps working even when you're stopped the nightly routine of using the laser, but it's unclear.
The Instructions recommend purchasing more Tria products, like tria priming cleanser and nourishing rye removal cream, to supplement this product.  I'm not surprised by this, but I used my own cleanser and cream, and it worked just as fine.

Overall, it seems to be working, but I'm disappointed that, despite the high price tag, it's apparently a disposable device - after 8 weeks, you're not supposed to be able to use it anymore.",1441670400,2015-09-08

3.0,"The gulsha Ultimate Rosewater Spray has a pleasing scent and is very refreshing to spritz on my face after washing my skin.

5.0,"I'm a Retin A user and long time lover of Obagi products since my former occupation was as a Paramedical Aesthetician (I have a Cidesco diploma, recognized around the world). This product did not cause any sensitivity even though I'm using a 1% (the highest) Retin A gel on my skin daily. Clear Fx is an AHA based cream (in this case, lactic acid) that helps cells turn over more rapidly to reveal clearer, less blotchy looking skin. Typically, some AHA acids do make my skin a bit irritable at times, but this product didn't, I will continue to use it since it will take some time to see actual results (I'll update my review in a month's time to report any changes in my skin). I'm very excited to have the opportunity to use this product and do whatever I can to clear up the discoloration on my skin

Since I'm familiar with Dr. Obagi's line, I can tell you that this is indeed an authentic product. Companies do change or upgrade their packaging at times, and that seems to be the case here. I compared this product with one from a med spa I formerly worked at and it checks out just fine.

This product doesn't have any fragrance to speak of, there is a very light scent that dissipates immediately. I love that this cream is readily absorbed into my skin, and doesn't leave a residue since I like to wear sunblock (at the very least on my ""minimalist"" days) and makeup. I plan on using this during the day, and my Retin A gel at night as I usually do. Only a small amount of product is needed, and it's best to focus on areas of discoloration and avoid any areas that you know are sensitive on your face (for me it's around the eye and nostril area, I tend to peel there).

Realize that this product WILL make your skin sun sensitive, you need a good sunblock as a companion for this product regardless of the time of day when it's used. This is the case with ANY glycolic or other type of acid (such as citric / Vit C) products. As a skin care professional, I highly recommend trying a test patch on your skin if you tend to be sensitive. I honestly think this is a good idea even if you have ""sturdy"" skin. When exploring powerful products like the Obagi line, I always suggest a visit with a skin care professional as well, preferably one with a paramedical (or med spa) background working with physicians such as Dermatologists or Plastic Surgeons. Powerful skin care is unlike typical OTC or department store lines, they actually DO WORK on the skin, so may cause side effects, espcially if not used properly. TIP: If you have ""testy"" skin or it happens to be around your menstrual cycle (which can cause temporary sensitivity), make certain to wait at least 15 min after washing your face before applying this cream.

I do plan to update this review when enough time passes to see results, or if I should have any issues with this product. Just in case you're wondering what's in this product, I will list the ingredients (also listed in the product description here @ Amazon). If you have inflammatory acne, proceed with caution. See if you can try a sample (may be available from the company or various cosmetic outlets like Sephora) to test on your skin before purchase.

Ingredients: water, arbutin, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearyl alcohol, tocopheryl acetate, ascorbic acid, saponins, sodium metabisulfite, BHT, lactic acid, disodium EDTA, butylparaben, methylparaben, propylparaben.

ACTIVE INGREDIENT:
ARBUTIN via Wikipedia: ""Bearberry extract is used in skin lightening treatments designed for long term and regular use. An active agent in brands of skin lightening preparations, it is more expensive than traditional skin lightening ingredients like hydroquinone, which is now banned in many countries. In vitro studies of human melanocytes exposed to arbutin at concentrations below 300 g/mL reported decreased tyrosinase activity and melanin content with little evidence of cytotoxicity.[5]

Arbutin is a glycoside; a glycosylated hydroquinone extracted from the bearberry plant in the genus Arctostaphylos. It inhibits tyrosinase and thus prevents the formation of melanin. Arbutin is therefore used as a skin-lightening agent. Arbutin is found in wheat, and is concentrated in pear skins. It is also found in Bergenia crassifolia.[1] Arbutin was also produced by an in vitro culture of Schisandra chinensis.[2]""

Obagi has a very professional staff on their site that can answer any questions you might have about their products, they have helped me out on more than one occasion and I've always had a good experience with the company (located in Irvine, CA.). If I can answer any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best. So far, this product has earned a well deserved 5 stars and I'm looking forward to clearer, more glowing skin!

UPDATE: It''s one day shy of a month so I wanted to update. My skin looks much better and has a new glow. Melasma discoloration is better and even my 'stork bite' birthmark (caused by forceps delivery) on my face is a bit lighter (that's a first with ANY product). Overall, my skin has a more even color and tone. I didn't experience any irritation from this product. I will continue to use this, especially since Summer is coming and I tend to get discoloration on the 'driver's side' of my face, even with sunblock. I stand by my original review (and 5 star rating) and still feel this is an excellent product, it fulfills it's promise in reducing blotchy/discolored skin.",1488585600,2017-03-04
2.0,"Mustela makes a big thing about their products being natural and hypoallergenic. Since I have sensitive skin, I always try a dab of any cream on the inside of my arm (where the skin is thin) and wait for a few hours. It only took a few seconds to realize that the Stretch Marks Prevention cream was problematic for me! It made my skin red and irritated, even on the back of my hand where I rubbed the leftover portion when more came out of the tube than I expected. I immediately washed my skin but it stayed red for a while and felt like it was burning.

So what is in this prevention cream? MustelaUSA says ""AQUA/WATER/EAU, DI-C12-13 ALKYL MALATE, ETHYLHEXYL COCOATE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CERA ALBA/BEESWAX/CIRE DABEILLE, LAURETH-23, GALACTOARABINAN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, GLYCERYL STEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), XANTHAN GUM, CETYL PALMITATE, COCOGLYCERIDES, SCLEROTIUM GUM, ZINC GLUCONATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FRUIT EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED AVOCADO PROTEIN, MALTODEXTRIN, CITRIC ACID, LUPINUS ALBUS SEED EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL."" (I apologize for the caps but I pasted this from their site.)

None of these are among my usual allergens but many of them I have not heard of.  I have had problems with some fragrances and a few fruit products. Fragrance can be anything so it is hard to judge but it is noticeable as soon as you open the tube. In EWG's Skin Deep Database, fragrance is the ingredient that keeps this product from getting a high rating, along with Laureth-23, which they say can cause irritation and organ system toxicity, and zinc gluconate, which can bioaccumulate and also has organ system toxicity.

The Mustela website claims good results based on a ""Clinical trial conducted on 26 pregnant women who used this product throughout their pregnancy.""  But personally I cannot recommend it. I did not dare to try the second product in the package after the bad experience with the first one. It also contains fragrance.

This set is made in France.",1492300800,2017-04-16

4.0,"I give this bronzer set 4 stars because of the lack of a highlighter color. The pen type highlighter is ok for highlighted lines, like under the eye brow, or above the lip, but you cannot use it to highlight your face above your cheekbone and under the eyes. Typically a bronzer/contouring palette has a highlighter color. The lightest shade in this one is actually a bit darker than it seems and does not function as a highlighter, unless you have a very dark skintone perhaps, but it is not iridescent either - it is matte.

The first color is a nice shimmery copper bronzer, the middle color is a matte natural medium tan, and the last color is matte light tan/dark beige but of course too dark to be a highlighter as previously mentioned. Perhaps you already have a favorite highlighter color in a separate palette and this will be no issue. I like the highlighter in one of my Lancome Blush Subtil Palettes, so I just use that and the colors go very well together.

The highlighter pen is like a loose powder eyeshadow pen that applies with a pointed sponge tip. The light colored end that you see in the pic is the small area that holds the color and the sponge tip is dipped into there to pick up the color. It is a bright gold, very shiny/sparkly, but can be blended down nicely to a pale shimmer.

The palette colors and the highlighter pen color are pretty well pigmented and apply very smoothly. Not chalky or dusty. A light swipe gives a very good amount of color and you can build it up as you need. You can tell that it is quality cosmetics and not just cheap stuff with a higher end brand name slapped on. The powders are pressed nicely, and while there is a bit of fall out onto the palette when swiping lightly with a brush, it doesn't seem to actually do any damage to the cakes. Of course your mileage will vary in that aspect depending on your brushes.

Overall I do like the colors in the set. They all give a very natural looking tone, with the only exception being the shimmery bronzer perhaps since it is so metallic, but that is expected with these types of cosmetics of course. You can use the colors on the eyes as well. The fact that they are very well pigmented means the palette should have a nice lifespan, especially with the amount of color which applies with just a light swipe. This was the first time I tried face cosmetics from Butter London and now after seeing the quality, I would not hesitate to buy more. The compact is very sturdy and well made also. Not thin or clanky. Reminds me of some of my thicker Lorac palettes.",1469145600,2016-07-22

I used several other products during the renewel of my natural nails. All the buffing and filing did damage and it took about 6 months to grow out the ridges from the fills and drills with the Acrylic's. Could not be happier that I took the product off and have perfect sport length nails. The Opi for Dry and Brittle nails is something I still use till this day. It lasts about a week. Two coats and then an Opi Top Coat, they look clean shiney and classy.",1357776000,2013-01-10
1.0,"I try to really give products like this a hard-core test. If it works well, I can always treat the other eye etc. For example, I reviewed a microdermabrasion kit that I used on only one side of my face :) Well, I used this Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer on only one eye. I used it religiously, in the morning and at night. Every single day.

I see absolutely no changes whatsoever. My eyes look exactly the same, even upon the closest inspection. My skin around my eyes does not feel firmer, the wrinkles are just as pronounced. No change. At the very high price tag, I would think I'd see something. I want to, Lord knows I got right up on the mirror and gave it every chance! :D

In my opinion, this is a huge waste of money. I will continue to use this for another two weeks and report back if there is any change.

5.0,This is an excellent everyday facial cleanser!  I had been using Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Facial Cleanser for years because I have sensitive skin and I love a good foaming facial cleanser.  Now I am in love with this.  It is very gentle.  It won't burn your eyes or make you itch like some facial cleansers do even though they claim that they are gentle.  This foam is very rich and you get a large amount with every pump.  It is so thick that I don't use a washcloth with it most of the time.  I just rinse with water and wipe it with my hands.  It makes my skin feel clean and refreshed.  It also has a very light scent that will not remain on you for long.  I have found nothing negative about it.  My husband has also used this and he likes it as well.,1505260800,2017-09-13

You could go with the brown, or the pink combination if you used just the two shades. You could also use all four shades if you desired. All four shades have a lot of shimmer in them.  This is not a matte palette at all.  I wished at least one of the shades would have been matte.

These are not highly pigmented, so this palette is great for beginners or people who do not want anything too extreme.  I thought the palette was ok, but there was nothing remarkable about it.",1468800000,2016-07-18
5.0,"Skin care is of vital importance to overall health. This organic, green apple peel, is a fine product for exfoliation and skin firming.
Some people apparently have burning or other irritation. Perhaps because I exfoliate daily, I did not encounter this.

Juice Beauty presents itself, on its website, as creating skin care products without chemicals that are viewed as increasing risk for cancer, endocrine disruption and other deleterious effects. The Green Apple Peel is certified organic. This is undoubtedly positive, particularly for women who may be exposed to health risks through cosmetics and other personal care products.

This product has the alpha hydroxy acid as an active ingredient. This is common in exfoliation, peel products. I was unable to locate the concentration data. Presumably, for this sensitive formulation, its rather low.

A question for users may be the cost. There are similar products available at a lower cost, with alpha hyrdroxy acid as an active ingredient. One may wish to compare the other ingredients to determine ones comfort level with them.",1416441600,2014-11-20

4.0,"This Bliss Brightening Kit works very well. I am finding that the cleanser though gentle is a bit drying as is the peel pads but the included Vitamin C Cream works to sooth the dryness. The cleanser and the cream are full sized products but there are only 5 peel pads in the kit. The peel pads are very well saturated and I've used one peel pad per week. I use a quarter of it and then fold it up and put it back into the pack and it keeps nicely until my next application.

This product reduces pores, refines fine wrinkles and cleanses and moisturizes wonderfully. I am more used to using a face cleanser that has some exfoliating but when I use a loofa sponge, this cleanser, while drying, works great for me.

All in all, this is a great kit for more mature skin.",1448928000,2015-12-01
5.0,"This has a very light texture like a lotion, not a cream consistency. It has a slight smell of the benzoyl peroxide. It absorbs really fast, and after a minute or two you feel the tingling/burning sensation on your skin--for my wife it was about a 5 minute long sensation. Obviously different skin types may react differently, but it doesn't leave her skin red like some other treatments. She has tried using 10% creams in the past, but they are too strong and cause a bad skin reaction and redness. This 5% mixture is the right balance for her skin. Compared to other benzoyl peroxide acne treatments, this does not dry your skin that much, but still is effective at reducing the acne. It gave noticeable results and clearer skin after just 1 week. The downside of this cream, like others, is that it increases your sun sensitivity, so you may need to take extra precautions to protect your skin. Of all the acne treatments my wife has used (at least a half dozen brands), this is the most effective she's used yet. However, if she stopped using it for a day or two, the skin condition regressed. But she was extremely satisfied with the results. A minor caution while using benzoyl peroxide treatments, they can discolor fabrics, like pillow-cases, so use a cheap one!
Another acne treatment with similar results but that doesn't affect sun sensitivity so much is the Skinoren brand with Acidum Azelaicum 200mg (20%). But this cream is mostly available in Europe; I have not found it in the USA yet.",1486339200,2017-02-06
4.0,"To start with a bit of background, I am a fair-skinned middle-aged woman with a few wrinkles so I was happy to be able to use the L'Occitane Immortelle Previous Serum.  Here's the story on the serum:  It is made from a Mediterranean flower called the Immortelle, a small yellow flower that ""never fades, even when it is picked"".  (Quotes from the package insert).  The L'Occitane people established an organic Immortelle plantation on the island of Corsica in order to extract vital components (essential oil, floral water and cell extracts) from the flowers to make this serum.  What the serum is supposed to do is stimulate collagen production, which produces smoother skin and fills in wrinkles, make for firmer skin by reinforcing the support network of the skin. and to stimulate microcirculation, making for younger looking skin.

I've used the serum faithfully (twice a day) for several weeks now, and while I really enjoy the way it makes my skin feel, I really can't say that it has made any difference in the texture of my skin or the number of wrinkles i currently have.  I would also note that there is a full line of products to use along with the serum (cleanser, makeup remover, eye balm, etc.) that I haven't used, so maybe if you can afford to buy the entire line, it may make a noticeable difference.

Again, the question is, would I buy this product?  At $70.00 for a 1 fl. oz. container, this is definitely outside my budget.",1419897600,2014-12-30

5.0,"What a beautiful foundation! It's lovely & very natural on the skin. It's important to use a brush with foundation like this in order to get even coverage ( a stipple brush would be best), otherwise it can look streaky when applied with fingers. Less product is needed this way and it will last longer than liquid foundation. My skin is a bit dry this time of year so I did a good exfoliation and moisturized my face and neck before application. I also love how it looks with a primer applied (I use Miracle Blur) when I'm going out. It looks smooth and is virtually undetectable, somewhere between light and medium coverage, yet is build-able if needed. #05 is perfect for my skin tone.... a paler medium color complexion with a slight yellow undertone. There is a fragrance, but it seems to dissipate immediately upon applying to the skin. The scent reminds me of ylang ylang, it's a bit sweet smelling rather than floral. I'm glad that the scent fades quickly since I don't care for fragrance in my foundation. This mousse style foundation gives a pretty airbrushed matte look and has the feeling of a high priced (department store) foundation. This foundation would be ideal for Normal to Oily/Combination skin, may be a bit too ""dry"" for dehydrated skin unless compensated with a very good moisturizer and/or exfoliation.

The mascara itself leaves them not clumped and soft, and pretty well defined. I'd say it's nice both for everyday use and on a night out. I probably like it even better than its waterproof counterpart which I tried as well, because this one is easier to take off in the evening. For a full tube at $25, it might be a little pricey, but seems worth it.",1492732800,2017-04-21

5.0,"Although expensive, M + G menthol shave cream will help you to a damned fine shave.  Icy cool and minty.  The best menthol shave cream anywhere is Noxzema Menthol in the light blue can, but Proctor & Gamble has made this ""flavor"" unavailable to the US market since 1997/98.  It's only available now to the United Kingdom market and the Italian market.

So, with Noxzema Menthol effectively gone for Americans, M + G is a worthy substitute.

Plus, I should add this important note: M + G offers as close and invigorating a shave as the famous Kiehl's White Eagle cream, but M + G has one clear advantage: it rinses much easier and cleaner from the razor.",1185926400,2007-08-01

5.0,This is a great color.  It mimics the natural raspberry color when on the nails.  I think this is a great color for spring.  It is appropriate for work or play and would even look nice while in a formal evening gown.  I particularly like Butter London nail polishes because they are free of most contaminates.  I feel that they also make my nails healthier.  I would recommend this color to everyone.,1364774400,2013-04-01
4.0,"I've been experimenting with this product for about a month now.

My hair:
My hair is naturally wavy  but will either look flyaway, frizz, puff, or get curly depending on the weather.

The unit:
The product has one power switch that slides either on or off. It does not accidentally turn off during use.
There is no temperature control.
The cord is super-long allowing a better range of motion OR a second person to assist with styling.

The glove:
There is a glove to use. This is not meant to directly touch the wand with as it isn't 100% heat proof...more like 75%. It serves t prevent accidental burns when holding the air in place.
The glove is HUGE.  I find this an issue as I have small hands and it makes it difficult to comb through a section of hair before wrapping it.

Use:
The directions indicate to wrap the hair around the wand, hold it for 15 seconds and then unwrap and hold until the curl is cool.
I personally do not have enough time to do this so I do let the hair hang to cool. I have not experienced any problems with this.

Results:
I've used this to make various types of curls and waves. Larger sections will make it wavier. Obviously smaller sections will create shorter springy curls.  I've had excellent results with all types of looks that I have attempted.  I never wrap the ends of my hair.  The results have lasted two days.  They would probably last longer but I prefer not to wash my hair less often than every other day.

Cons:
The glove, while necessary, is awkward to use because it doesn't fit right.
I am suspicious of any product that does not trust my ability to judge what temperature is best for my hair. It is my hair, after all. I have had it my entire life so I'm pretty sure I can make an informed decision about settings.
The reasons above are why I gave the product 4-stars versus 5.
There is no way to control the temperature",1519430400,2018-02-24

Just add the brushes you like and cleanser for the end of the day and you're all set. Just like the other Bliss products I've received lately, these blend well and can be layered.

It felt pretty good -- a little cool and refreshing but not too drying.  I put my evening moisturizer on right after I used this so I don't know how it would have felt without that.

It eases crepe really well.  It's not a miracle worker, but it moisturizes the eye area really well.  I don't find it particularly tightening though, so I don't know why they call it  'contour' gel cream, other than it has caffeine in it, and can help puffiness.  I don't often have problems with puffiness myself.)

I have no stinging, redness or feelings of tightness with this product- it is very comfortable to use and has minimal fragrance if any.  I can't smell it.

4.0,This is my first time trying a product like this. I have pale skin that is somewhat blotchy and my cheeks are always a bit red. If I have a blemish the redness last weeks even after the blemish is gone.  The concealer is really green and a little goes a long way so definitely blend this in thoroughly.  I found that it worked better for me if I used this under a medium to full coverage foundation.  Most days I use a powder foundation due to it being quick and easy but found that the power I was using was too light and the green tint showed through too much for my likening.  I've been using this when I wear full coverage liquid foundation for special occasions and it doesn't look green but takes the red look out and covers well.  This product does help diminish the redness and give a more even complexion.,1498435200,2017-06-26

3.0,"This is a very inexpensive and effective product. Though I've decided it's not for me, I'm surprised by the reviews that say it doesn't work. I'm guessing they are used to feeling beads like in microderm abrasion products. It worked TOO MUCH for my sensitive skin!

You wet your skin. Put a small amount on your face - it feels like a serum, which surprised me. Rub it all around until stuff sloughs off. Rinse. Easy enough. For those of you who remember Pretty Hands and Feet, it's SO MUCH like that, except for your face.

I use a lot of quality skin care. This is by far less expensive than similar products. For some of you, it may be perfect. Here's why it doesn't work for me:
- As I mentioned, it's a bit too heavy duty. I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be very careful about the products I use. After, my skin felt so soft and smooth, but it was blotchier and a bit irritated. If I was new to exfoliating, I would think this was a normal reaction to beginning use. However, I exfoliate twice a week and use a Clarisonic, so I know that's not the case.
- The little clumps that slough off can be hard to keep out of your hair. Between the rubbing and the rinsing, I couldn't keep this out of my hairline, even with a shower cap. I'd recommend it for pre-shampoo. This just doesn't really work for my skin care routine - I usually do my face at a different time than I shower.

So if those concerns aren't relevant to you, you would probably love it. However, if you are like me and want to keep looking, I recommend the Aveda clay mask (been using it for years, very gentle) as a lower cost option. For a splurge, Bliss' microderm option can't be beaten.

3.0,"60 capsules of serum/moisturizer in a jar with screw top.

The capsules are a nice idea, but I'm not entirely sold on it. It's not that it is a hassle, but it's just an added step to my already ""beauty in a hurry"" attitude. It gives me a good amount of product to smooth on my face, but not so much on the throat and chest, however. The good part is there's no dipping my fingers into the cream and having too much, or contaminating the rest (though I always use clean hands and only I use my creams).

Applying the lotion is so very nice. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. There's no way for me to tell what it's doing at a ""cellular level"" because not enough time has passed for me to know what effect this will have on my skin long-term.

But a big negative is that it's way over my budget. At 60 capsules, two a day, that is a month of product for $54 (at time of this review). So $54 a month for a serum. If I thought it was doing really great things I still couldn't pay $54 a month. I could use it once a day and that would make it more manageable, but there are also other serums on the market that aren't as expensive and give the same feeling to my face and make the same claims. Perhaps this line of Cindy Crawford products does have better quality ingredients and some ""magic"" to it, but I still would have a hard time paying $54 a month for any beauty product on my budget.

Money aside, if I weren't concerned with my budget, I'm not sure if I would purchase. I really do like how it makes my skin feel but I have less expensive serums that feel great too. If I see that it does wonders for my face as time goes on, I'll come back to reflect that.",1484697600,2017-01-18

5.0,"Medium/full coverage foundations can be tricky.  It's hard to find that balance between covering up any imperfections without makeup looking cakey or unnatural.  This foundation from Dermablend impressed me because it strikes that balance.  It's great for covering blemishes or other imperfections.

I applied it using the directions on Dermablend's website.  The suggest starting with a small amount of product, warming it up with your fingertips to make the product more bendable, and then tapping it directly over your imperfections.  They state you can use multiple layers by allowing one layer to dry and applying more, but thankfully one layer has been perfect for me.  Then you finish things off by applying setting powder, allow to set for 2 minutes then brush off excess powder with a brush.  Dermablend makes its own setting powder but I don't own it so I've been setting my makeup with Laura Mercier and Hourglass's powders instead, and have liked the results with both.

I still think I prefer lighter coverage for everyday wear, especially since I'm in my 30's and self-conscious about not accentuating fine lines or dryness.  But I really like this for nights out when I tend to wear bolder makeup.  It compliments a bold lip or smokey eye well.

5.0,"As everyone who cares about their appearance knows, skin care products come at us at record speed all making big promises. Glycolix Elite Treatment Pads not only deliver dramatic results it is the best skin care product I have ever used. First of all it cost pennies a day to use this product. You only need one pad to totally cover your face, neck and hands. So, one jar lasts 2 months--in which time your skin looks years younger. The main ingredient is doctor strength 20% Glycolic Acid which has been medically proven to exfoliate skin, reducing fine lines, blemishes and never tone. You see results in just a day or so. I use it at night rubbing really hard to get all the dirt, oil and dead skin off. You can see the pad turn brown after. Then, I use a good moisturizer like Vitamin C serum and go to bed. In the morning skin looks incredible and with daily use it just looks better and better day by day week by week. One note of caution: If you have sensitive skin and have been reactionary to any similar products in the past I suggest you start out with 10% Otherwise, use this every other day or every third day till your skin gets used to it.",1454457600,2016-02-03

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar.

2-There are no cleaning instructions with the tool, so one is left to their own vices as to what cleaning product to use. She finds warm water and facial cleansing soap work just fine.

On the positive side, this tool helps blend really well and the smoothness of the stem makes it easy on the hands--ergonomically friendly. The angle is perfect for reaching otherwise difficult areas, which she would normally do with my finger.

She is giving it 4 stars solely on the basis that this item is overpriced. Had it been about $20, I would have given it 5.  Because it is so new,  she does not know how long the foam part will hold up. However, it appears to be well made.",1429833600,2015-04-24

I have not waited the recommended 28 days to see the full difference the product claims to make but I can see some improvement in my skin with regards to reduced roughness and increased firmness.,1472256000,2016-08-27

4.0,"A bit about me, I've been wet shaving for probably close to 2 years, and in that time have tried about 20 brushes or so.

This brush arrived in a large cardboard tube, and inside was the packed brush and an instruction sheet.  The case for this brush is aluminum, and the knot fits inside the brush when not in use.  It's assembled by removing the ring at the top, taking out the knot, screwing it to the ring, and screwing the ring back to the case.  The quality of the materials was top notch, and I didn't notice any blemishes.

So on to the shave.  I heated up my scuttle, that has a brush warmer, and put some hot water on my soap.  I tried the brush with Mike's Rose/Cedarwood soap, which is fairly firm.  It soaked for about 15 minutes while I took a shower.  The soap lathered up easily with this brush, and it held a decent amount of lather.  I do generally prefer a denser knot than this brush had though.  During the lathering I did not see any shed hairs, so that was very good.  The brush wasn't at all floppy, and I was able to work the lather into my beard very well.  I did notice a strong animal scent with this brush, so you may want to deal with that pretty early on, especially if you plan to pack the brush and travel.  My only real problem with the brush, was when I was loading it and working up a lather it did tend to unscrew itself.  Not a huge problem, but distracting.

I wouldn't say it's my favorite travel brush, but it's a nice convenient setup which I would recommend.",1374624000,2013-07-24
3.0,"I have used Shiseido for my skin forever. I'm not very good at religiously washing my face like I should be but when I am in my routine I love the stuff. I don't mind mixing up my skin care products, mainly because if there's something that works better why not try it?

I decided to give the L'Occitane Immortelle serum a shot. It say's it has 1001 flowers mixed in there and I'm guessing it's 999 flowers too many. I did not enjoy the fragrance one bit. In fact, I can't wait to put my moisturizer over it just to get rid of the smell. It's not good. I guess too much of a good thing can be bad.

I feel like my face has been softer maybe a bit brighter and I love the way it feels. However, I'm not sure if it's worth the price tag.

The product manufacturer states the following product specifications and claims: ""Shape, define and brighten with our customizable 4-piece bronzer clutch. This all-in-one palette features three primer infused, buildable shades to create the ultimate contoured face. These unique formulas are infused with color boosting ingredients to prolong the appearance of your tan, enhancing the natural pigmentation of your complexion. We also included a uniquely crafted on the glow highlighting pen that adds a strobe of light where you want it most. Universal for any skin tone, its the go-to sculpting palette to achieve an effortless contoured face.""

With that said my wife is quite pleased with this product.  She states that the bronzer is the perfect way to shade her face and that the product blends very nicely and quick.  She added that the product only needs to be applied once and that it does not run, smear, or transfer.  Last, she claims that the product does not irritate her skin and is a high quality cosmetic product that comes in a convenient clutch.  Again, she is very pleased with it.  Well done at five stars.",1469318400,2016-07-24
5.0,"This is an excellent hand cream and I would definitely recommend this product for long lasting benefits for dry hands. It's not the cheapest product but it's also not the most expensive that I've tried and the results are just as good, if not better. I don't usually wear gloves in the cold winter months so my hands do get dry and chapped - they also get dry from my frequent hand washing throughout the year (I'm a little OCD). When I put this cream on before going to bed at night I awaken the next morning and my hands are still smooth. The cream doesn't wear off quickly like some of the others do and it's not greasy either. I actually bought this product after trying Ahava's body wash, body lotion and foot cream and am a fan of them all. The hand cream doesn't have a strong fragrance so it would be good for men as well as women. Also, a very small amount is needed as this cream is quite thick making it cost efficient.",1481328000,2016-12-10

I usually put it on, comb through, blow dry to get it penetrated and leave it on all nite. Then in the morning add a tiny bit of water and a handful of shampoo and ""dry shampoo"" it out, it usually takes a second shampooing after rinsing out the first. My hair ends up looking and feeling very soft, healthy, yet not limp, stray gray hairs somehow seem to blend in and it looks like I just had a haircut.

4.0,"This eye makeup remover is very effective at removing eye makeup, including those that are water proof.  It doesn't cause any irritation and is easy to wash off.  There are a few reasons I am not giving it 5 stars.

1) Pricey for what it is (mostly oil and water)
2) Application process is wasteful (pouring onto a pad causes excess product to be used)
3) Fluid separates quickly (again, oil and water)

For background I have always used a drop of baby oil on my finger tip to remove eye makeup, then I wipe it off with a bit of tissue and wash my face.  It's super cheap and works great.  I used the same technique with MAKE and it greatly reduced the waste of saturating a cotton round or tissue and since this product is so pricey, you'll want to come up with some way to conserve it.  Also, be quick wit the shake and use method for better results.  The benefit this product offers over my baby oil method, is that it doesn't seem to leave the same oily residue after wiping it off that baby oil does.",1447891200,2015-11-19

The face sunscreen's SPF is lower than another one I used during the day, but was perfect for layering under foundation (also with sunscreen) or for times of day when the sun wasn't as intense.

1.0,"I started using this product with the practice attachment for about a month, and I waited a full week between uses each and every single time. I didn't see any really difference, but I liked it well enough to keep going. After about a month I went up to the next attachment which I believe is called ultra sensitive.

The first few weeks were okay. And then about a week ago I noticed that I have dark lines and discoloration on my face. Now, I initially wondered if the complaints of this might be due to stripping a tan or something. But no... the lines caused by this device on my skin are dark.

Now, when I say I watched the videos, I don't just mean the one that comes with the device. I do mean *all* of the videos. The bad reviews, the everything. And I went it planning not to use the more abrasive attachments, and not to attempt using it too often.

Maybe... maybe for some people using it every 2 weeks could solve the problem. Maybe staying on the practice head (which doesn't do anything at all, really) could be worth it. But for the price?  And the risk of having dark lines and discoloration across your face? It's really not worth it in my opinion.

I didn't pay the full price suggest here. I found it on sale at Nordstrom. And even at $60 less it still seems like a huge risk to take with your face especially if you have sensitive skin.

I did honestly like it after the first use of the ultra sensitive disc. But discoloration with the most sensitive option is absurd.",1489881600,2017-03-19

The scent is great but it will conflict with any other scent you wear so plan accordingly.  The scent actually lasts longer than the shine and almost as long as the hold.  I did notice the shine tones way down after a few hours.  Even after reactivating it by wet combing, it'll shine up again but become dry again pretty quickly.  The container is great for DIY stuff.  I'll be trying their other pomades and can't wait.

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

2.0,"As a makeup artist, I know how important it is to have good brushes to do the best work.  Not only to you need the brush to perform well, but be durable and stand up to cleaning.  Let's see how the Japonesque Kumadori Countour/Highlight Brush measures up.

WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?
This brush is about 6 1/2"" long with the handle being 5"" and the brush head 1 1/2"" long.  The brush head is about 1 3/8"" wide at its widest point.  The shape of the brush is a teardrop shape.  The bristles are natural and they are not at all dense in the way they are packed.  I would put this more in the fluffy category and not dense.

The handle is tapered, but the base seems to be a rubbery base underneath.  A rim of that material is visible up near the base of the brush head.  The rest of the handle is wrapped with a natural piece of what resembles thin wicker.  I am not sure what the actual name of it is.  It is wrapped and glued down with the end tucked up under at the top.  It simply ends at the tip of the handle and is not tucked down.  The surface texture of the wrapped handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate in your hand, although in certain positions it can feel rough.

HOW DOES THIS BRUSH PERFORM?
As for performance, this brush does not do too well picking up product from a pan unless the pan of makeup is very very soft and easily picked up.  It does not disperse the product as equally on the skin as I would like.  I have tried this with blush, bronzer and highlighter, but I find that it seems to work best with Guerlain Meteorites.

That is not necessarily a bad thing as Guerlain Meteorites are little balls of product which are in different colors.  It is hard to find a brush which applies them well.  They act more as a highlight or finishing powder in a very subtle manner.

This brush would also work decently with mineral makeup.  The tip makes it get into smaller spaces of the face like around the nose and inner eyes, but is broad enough to use on the rest of the face and under the chin.

I did not find that the bristles were dense or sturdy enough to pick up sufficient product to apply to the skin evenly from pans of color such as contour or highlight.

I tend to get better results from brushes in that same shape but much higher density than this one is.

WHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BRUSH
My biggest problem with this brush is that it is not going to be easy to clean.  Brushes are meant to be used and that means they will get dirty.  Sometimes handles will also get dirty.  In the case of this brush, the handle being wrapped by the wicker like pieces, I don't see this brush being easy to clean.  The bristles being wet only is possible, but any moisture at all on this handle is bound to make it come apart eventually.

I imagine if you were to coat the handle with something that would withstand moisture, you could probably still use this brush and it would be more practical.  That way the handle would not unwrap with constant cleaning and you could still enjoy the brush.

THE BOTTOM LINE
If used for application of light powdery highlights or contour that is not packed hard in a pan, or sphere powders like Guerlain Meteorites, this brush would be good.  For use where you want to deposit color more evenly from pans of product, it is not the best brush. The composition of the handle makes it not practical to clean as if the handle becomes wet over time, the handle will probably come apart.  It you are a brush collector and love unusual brushes, and the practicality of this does not matter to you, then you might still love this brush.  If you are a practical person who uses their brushes a lot and likes to keep them clean all of the time, this might not be the brush for you.

I have rated this two stars because I feel that it just isn't practical for makeup use that leads to lots of cleaning for that price.",1457827200,2016-03-13

5.0,"Absolutely weightless serum.  As someone already stated the dispenser is very annoying.  You have to go two or three times for enough coverage.  Other than that...  The product I received has very little to no scent at all.  My skin looks luminous after one week of use, two droppers at night before bed.  I really like this product.  It really does make my skin look more illuminated and tighter.  The wrinkles I have in my forehead are going to require botox, lol, I don't think anything OTC is going to help those.  Maybe even some of that injected filler stuff (although I have heard horror stories of the filler breaking free and lumping up somewhere else!)  However, the billion fine lines from crow's feet are now in the high thousands.  Many of the little tiny lines do soften quite nicely with the serum.  I use all over my face, especially around my eyes and my lips.

This product does NOT irritate my eyes.  I sleep with a masque over my eyes and most eye creams that I have tried end up burning my eyes, swelling them and/or causing endless tears.  I have none of that with the Vichy.

Now as a weirdo side note as only I can deliver.  My acne prone skin hasn't broken out at ALL since I started using this.  In no way have I read about that being a benefit, but hey, I love being blemish free.  Ok, and now for the really weird, I rub the extra into my hand and cuticles, after slathering my face and neck.

If I happened to get too much, I couldn't do anything else but to smear it out more to other areas of the face. There were some mornings I woke up and the skin underneath the eye lashes was so itchy, but I wasn't 100% sure if the eye cream causes it.

Another lesson to learn from this product is that eye cream lasts very long because I use very little st a time, so I should never buy the jar package again as it's not very sanitary over a long period of time. After 3 months and the jar was still almost full!!",1484611200,2017-01-17

4.0,"18.21 Man Made Sweet Tobacco Spirits is the most unique fragrance I've ever encountered. I am a lifelong wearer of colognes, typically running toward the citrus and spicy side as opposed to musky scents.

This fragrance is really ""heavy"" at first - you don't need more than one spritz - this is strong stuff. However, it does mellow with wear. It has a masculine tone to it, without a doubt - and for some reason, it does somehow have an undercurrent of tobacco leaves (not like a cigarette, cigar or pipe, but rather the leaves themselves). It definitely has citrus and spice tones as well and they all blend together in a completely different scent than I've ever encountered before.

It is so unique among colognes that it took me a couple of wearings before I could really decide if I liked it or not. I have decided that I do.

For some reason, it gives me the feeling that I could be wearing this as I am out and about on the weekends (in the fall and winter - not a summer cologne) wearing a tweed jacket, blue jeans or cords and a pair of oxfords. Very gentlemanly - landed gentry smell to it.",1475539200,2016-10-04

I use the product straight from the jar.

I used the ""medium"" concealer which is the best option for me out of the 3 colors possible. The product is thick and stays on all day. It does cover blemishes if applied correctly. With the applicator, I dab and blot the concealer on my skin and then blend gently. A little goes a long way.  I don't use foundation just powder to set it.

He has tried a few different oils, and has found some that he likes more than others. In general, though, beard oil seems better suited to longer beards. He keeps his trimmed to be three-quarters of an inch, and this one really acts more like a face moisturizer than a true beard oil with this short length.

5.0,"This is not foundation or blush or highlighter - it is a ""finish"" & ""perfector"" - kind of a hybrid of those cosmetics.  Although you can wear it alone it is also designed to be worn over foundation.  So you know how you want your T-zone to look very matte with no pores and not powdery/ashy?  But you want other parts of your face (cheek bone/brow bone) to look more dewy & ""highlighted"" without looking wet/sparkly/shiny/white?

Well, this little compact helps solve both of those problems.  One side goes over those too-shiny pore areas making them look flat but natural (the peach one) & mattifies oily skin.  And the other side adds just the right amount of dewiness/moisture without making you look goopy/greasy (the pink one) - genius.  It really does not cake up on your face if you reapply during the day as long as you apply lightly and not too often.

You apply with your fingers so make sure your hands/fingers are very clean before using. That is the one thing I'm not wild about because if I am out-&-about, I may not have immediate access to a sink to wash my hands.  But that is a minor complaint since I do not need to reapply often.

5.0,"I didn't think I would like Julep Nail Treatment/ Sheer Coat at first, because the fluid seemed to thin- the polish just dripped fairly quickly off the brush, and it seemed thinner in consistency than any other polish i have. Still, when i tried this on, it actually had good coverage, went on smoothly, and added just enough color to make my nails look healthy, covering the slightly stained/ dull yellow tint i get sometimes from long term polish use. It makes my nails look like naked healthy nails that have been buffed--and, it feels pretty good on.  I really like the the way this looks with one coat, and i don't think i need another. The directions say you can wear one or two coats, and then reapply another coat after three to four days. They recommend not using this with other polishes.  If you want to give your nails a break from your gels or acrylics, but don't want to have ugly looking nails, this is a good product to get.

update: i've used this for 2 mo. now, and i am surprised and happy to say that my nails do feel stronger, and have grown out without ripping off or chipping as easily as they did before i tried this. this treatment really sticks on the nails and does not flake off too easily. even if it flakes a bit over time, the color is so neutral, it's not very noticeable. i thought this was a bit pricey when i first used it, but it really does seem worth the money.",1469145600,2016-07-22

2.0,"If I had done my research before hand, I would not have ordered this product.  I did try it before I read the ingredients and found it only marginally helped my dry, frizzy hair.  It did make it bit shinier, but didn't really tame it like the video shows so I don't feel like I'm losing the best thing ever by not using it. I certainly didn't say ""wow"". If you use a hot dryer and a round brush, even without products, it will smooth down and shine more so I don't think that part of the video is a good representation of how it works.
Now that I have read the ingredients and done my research I can't recommend this product. The second ingredient is PROPYLENE GLYCOL, an ingredient that various websites warn against using.  It's the same ingredient that is in anti-freeze.  It works by breaking down the hair so it appears shiny and relaxed, but it can irritate the skin and can be absorbed. Factory workers are told to use goggles and gloves when handling this ingredient, according to one website.  It is a very common ingredient in shampoos and conditions, and I'm not saying this product is any worse than another, but I, personally, am trying to put less chemicals in and on my body since I'm so sensitive to so many things these days.. There are a lot of other ingredients listed as well with long chemical names that may or may not be bad, but since Propylene Gycol is number 2 after water on the list, I stopped there and won't use it again.  I advise anyone to do their own research and see if it is a concern, or not, to you.  As I said, it's in a lot of products and has been used for years, but of course that doesn't make it a good thing.",1460592000,2016-04-14

The box is printed in at least three languages. The first three ingredients are water, glycerin and safflower oil. Zoom in on a thumbnail picture on the left of the product page for a complete list of the ingredients.  Paraben free and non comedogenic, they say.

The bottle has a clever pop-up dispenser. On the other hand you cant see how much product is in the bottle. At this price you will probably want to eke out every drop.

It took about two pumps to cover my face. The lotion absorbs quickly and doesnt leave a greasy feel. It has a slightly medicinal fragrance.

The good news is my face didn't fall off. The bad news is I really couldn't tell any difference in my skin from using a regular moisturizer. Of course all skin is different and it might work great for someone else so Ill give it three stars for meh.

3.0,"First off, I haven't been using this long enough to really see any changes.  If something drastic happens I will definitely come back and update this review.  So far, it is a nice unscented cream.  The best part is that it soaks in nicely and doesn't sit on the surface feeling greasy.  I can apply this and then put on makeup just a few minutes later with no trouble.  My skin tends to be sensitive and this hasn't caused any breakouts or redness so far.  That is a big thumbs up.
The down side? It is far more expensive than the face cream I usually buy, and this company does that irritating thing where they give you a big heavy jar in an even bigger box...that has a deceptively small pocket of cream inside.  I imagine it really does contain the 1.7 ounces it says it does, but the jar is huge and heavy.  The box has an extra fold of cardboard to make it look even bigger.  My skin isn't particularly dry, but it does seem to take a lot to smooth over my face and neck.  Maybe I'm more dry than I thought? Or maybe this expensive cream takes a lot in each use?
Honestly, I'm not sure what to hope for here.  I would love to find a great face cream.  I just don't think I want to pay this much for it.",1523491200,2018-04-12
5.0,"While at first I found the idea of grinding my own makeup each time I used it to be an unnecessary gimmick  I quickly learned to love the smooth flawless finish this makeup gives me.  It looks like I have amazing, natural un-madeup skin when I'm wearing this.

I first tried applying this with a sponge, which caused the sponge to absorb most of the makeup as it is very damp and full of moisture, and not much was left to smooth on my skin.  A foundation brush is a must with this makeup and you can blend and smooth out this makeup into either a very thin coating, or apply it thickly for more coverage.  This is highly blendable and can build up in multiple coats as it dries to give you the exact coverage you want.

The medium shade is perfect for my medium to fair, warm skin color.  I do not find the shade to be one that requires an exact match since this does allow some of my own skin shade to show through, although I put on a fairly thin application.

The grinding of the makeup to mix with the cream can be a little messy but not bad.  Then you swirl the brush through the foundation to mix it up and this does seem to make the  makeup more natural looking.  Also my skin seems to love the treatment aspect of this and I noticed when I washed this off at night that my skin had a healthy glow.  I do love this makeup but not the price.

1.0,"This is a very thin, clear oil.  It isn't as thick as baby oil and runs almost like water.  I would never put oil or an oil-based product on my skin because it clogs the pores.  Some people might be able to get away with it, but even though I have dry skin, my skin will break out if I put oil on it, so I have skipped that test.  I did rub it into my hands and it dries fast without leaving an oily slick.

What I did use this for is my hair, which is very thick and very dry.  After shampooing, I poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together.  Then I ran my hands through my hair, keeping the oil away from the scalp area.  Afterwards, I blew my hair dry then applied more oil.  Usually, I apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.  However, the oil did not produce the same results.  My hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it.  My newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair shafts, but the morning after I used the oil, the results were no different than the night before.

Attractive and easy-to-hold, the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush, White/Silver is as effective as it is lovely.  The slender, ergonomic shape allows you to hold this cleansing brush without slipping from your hand, even when it is wet.  Three different heads provide different options from cleansing your skin  one for regular cleansing, one to massage your skin, and one for sensitive skin.

Because I have sensitive skin, I love the specific head for that skin-type.  It does not irritate or cause abrasions on my skin  this is a definite plus.  It helps remove my make-up completely and leaves my skin feeling invigorated.  Individuals who can use the regular head or massage head will find these do an excellent job cleansing their face.

While the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush charges, a blue strobe-like light initially rotates around the brush head; it then glows steadily during the charging phase and goes out when the unit is fully charged.  The initial charge takes about six hours and lasts for 30 uses.  Three cleansing speeds provide additional options for your facial cleansing routine.  An additional plus is that you can use this cleansing brush while you are in the shower as long as you do not immerse in completely.

If you are looking for an excellent facial cleansing brush, I recommend the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush, White/Silver.",1457136000,2016-03-05
5.0,I love this shave cream.  It comes in a small package and the price may turn you off but don't worry.  First you only need to apply a small dab and if by mystery it will cover your whole face.  The blade just slides right over your face.  I have never cut myself or received razor burn using The Art of Shaving Shave Cream.  I promise you this is hands down better that what you are currently using.,1228176000,2008-12-02

5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a line of polish offered by an airlines, and for the price I didn't want to be disappointed. I am happy to concede that these are worth the price tag. I'm actually excited to be flying in to Germany soon so I can hopefully see more of the USL polishes in person. The color range offered here on Amazon is extensive and offers a great range of colors, I just don't know how reliable the names matched to the color swatches are as I ordered KBJ Kings Canyon, which the swatch makes look like a dark brown, but when I received the correctly labeled polish it's a maraschino cherry red. Other than that, though it's a beautiful red... and the coverage is amazing.
I tried this the same way I would if I were traveling, no base and no top, it applied easily, smoothly, and when it says it has built in ridge filler it means it. You couldn't tell that underneath those two smooth layers was some pretty deep grooves from poorly removed gel damage.
The brush on this is not as wide as and OPI pro wide, but still wider than an Essie brush. The bristles are soft and spread easily, giving almost my entire nail coverage is a single stroke! The dry time was fast, and even without a top coat it was glossy.
I plan on picking up a nice travel neutral, though quite a few colors are calling my name!",1433203200,2015-06-02
5.0,"I found that the cream works. First, it served as a nice cleansing of my face, as if I had washed it with a soft soap. My skin felt smooth after this washing. Then I washed off the cream and applied a very thin layer again to shave, and again it worked well. Although not advertised to do so - because the cream is advertised for razors - I used it with an electric shaver and it worked very well. It has a nice subtle smell. It comes with a cover over the spout so that it will not spill before it is used the first time. I got a nice close shave.

3.0,"I have mixed emotions after having used this product for about 10 days.  Here's why:
Does my skin feel softer than before?  Yes
Does my skin look any different?  No
Is the improvement enough to justify the time and cost required?  Well, herein lies my quandary.

I received this product as a sample through the Amazon Vine program. Never in a million years would I have spent that kind of money on what is essentially a ""vanity"" product.  Never.  Ever.  Granted, the tub of creme is massive and those 10 ounces will last long enough to take some of the sting our of the cost-per-use.  But the Exfoliating scrub is only 8 ounces and I feel like I'm using it at a disproportionate rate to the creme.  I expect I'll have to switch to a different method of exfoliant before I get to the bottom 1/3rd of the creme.  Anyway you look at it, a hundred fifty bucks to get started is a huge cash outlay, at least from my perspective.  I'd have to declare this as a capital asset on my personal financial statement had I paid full price for it.

Secondly, the directions for use require a substantial amount of time.  You are to dampen the skin, scrub with the body polish, wash the scrub off and then moisturize with the creme.  The most effective way to do this is scrub before showering and moisturize after you towel off from the shower.  If you try to just rinse the scrub off at the sink with a washcloth you invariably leave some grans of scrub on your skin.  This makes for an mess when you go to rub the creme in.  Any way you do it, you're looking at a 15-20 minute process, unless you are just targeting one or two small areas.

I used this on my elbows, knees and neck- which kind of extended to my whole arms, legs and chest.  Once you've got the scrub on your hands and targeted areas anyway, it only makes sense to do the surrounding areas too.  I was going to leave two areas untreated as a ""control"" for the test but I couldn't bring myself to risk being asymmetrical considering all the effort I was putting forth.  The kicker is that now I really don't know if it was the ingredients in the ""Crepe Erase"" that made my skin softer or if it was just the result of getting all that attention after years of neglect.

So I'll use this up but wouldn't  buy more.  I'll be fine with some gentle soap, a scrubby bath poof and some basic moisturizer.  Wouldn't it be great if we could all just be happy with ""the skin we're in"" without going to such desperate measures to meet somebody else's definition of beautiful?",1459036800,2016-03-27
5.0,This tanning mousse goes on evenly and really gives your skin a nice tan look.  I only use it on my legs but am sure it would go on just as easy for the rest of the body.

5.0,"I mainly use this oil for conditioning my goatee and shaving my legs (Im a cyclist) but Ive also used it to moisturize really dry areas. The oil does a very good job of conditioning and softening my beard and preventing fly-aways. You need to use it consistently and it takes a little time for it to really take effect but I truly does work great. Your beard will be softer without looking oily. Its also scent free which I strongly prefer. Another review said it has a lemon scent. Im not getting that and typically Im pretty sensitive to odors. If theres a scent its very subtle. I also use this oil for leg shaving. It makes the shaving process faster and safer (little to no cuts or nicks). Oil is preferable to cream so you can see what you're doing and where you're shaving. Its thick enough to not require much product but not so thick that your razor is instantly gummed up. Ive also used Pacific Shaving Company oil (too thin) and Shave Secret oil (too thick). Since this is an oil, I don't often use it for moisturizing but its very effective in that capacity particularly if you have a very dry and stubborn area. Im giving this product 5 stars because it works great for all its intended uses but the reality is that Im unsure how often I will purchase it due to its high price. I will have to wait and see how long a bottle lasts. So far a little bit goes a long way so it very well may end up being worth the high price.",1392422400,2014-02-15
4.0,"I've been using this with my Clarisonic and it gets my dry, acne prone skin very clean and without leaving a noticeable residue behind.  I appreciate that it leaves my skin feeling naked without stripping it of needed oils.  The fragrance is also soft and not overpowering or noxious, which I appreciate as sometimes drugstore cleansers can be too potent smelling to my nose.  The only thing I would say is that if I am wearing eye makeup I do feel I need to use a dedicated eye makeup remover.  I can eventually get it off with this cleanser but it dose seem to require more time and elbow grease to do so and I sometimes find a few eye lashes (my own not implants) fall off in the process.  But that isn't unique to this cleanser, I generally find I prefer a dedicated eye makeup remover.

The lotion was fairly heavy going on, but I gave it a few minutes to sink into my skin before I went hiking.  Sweat didn't seem to bother it in the least, although it did bother me - I was hot and tired.  I had no sunburn redness on my skin by the time I made it home.

The next day, I took a several-mile walk but on sidewalks instead desert trails.  I used the sunscreen but forgot to put it on my exposed ears, and by the time I got home, my ears, and only my ears, were quite red.  I've used the sunscreen several times since then, and am quite happy with it.

It protects against both UVA and UVB rays, but I think that is pretty standard now.  What impressed me most was its staying power, its excellent protection, and the lack of any overpowering fragrance.",1392508800,2014-02-16

Turns out, the SPF pills horribly when you apply it over the serum, *even* if you wait a few minutes for the serum to dry. This moisturizer was lightly hydrating, probably would have been adequate for my dry skin in warm, humid conditions, but it didn't feel good on my face. Although I can tolerate *some* fragrance, this product was, for me, a bit too heavily scented, and I found that it has sort of been stinging my skin all day long (I am rosacea / redness prone). The scent is pleasant, but there is simply too much of it. I chose this product because the mix of chemical filters has usually worked well for me in the past. Still, for reasons I don't really understand, this product also left a bit of a white tint on my olive skin.",1524268800,2018-04-21

5.0,"I originally tried Baxter of California After Shave Balm as part of a starter kit that contained a Baxter of California shaving brush, shaving cream, and this balm.  The balm has a pleasant citrus scent to it, but it fades quickly and will not interfere with the scent of any other aftershave or cologne you might want to use afterward.  I really like how my face feels after using it.  I usually rub some alum on my face after shaving and rinse it off right before I apply the balm.  Just a small dab of the balm is needed, and I find one tube has lasted several months with daily usage with about 1/3 of the tube still remaining.  My face always feels really good afterwards, and I have experienced less shaving irritation with the balm.  After using it for a few weeks I have found my complexion has improved, too.

Baxter of California After Shave Balm is expensive, but if you want a product that will make your face feel and look good after shaving it is worth its added cost.",1374537600,2013-07-23

2.0,"I'm 33 with oily, and acne prone skin. My acne is currently under control, but none the less, new products can sometimes cause a problem. First, I'll say that I was rather frustrated to not be able to find the ingredients to this product online, either here on Amazon, nor on the MEG21 website (atleast at the time of writing this review). Had I been able to see the ingredients I don't think I would have purchased. I will type them out at the bottom of this review.

Although I have oily skin, I have had good luck with cream cleansers in the past, and so wanted to give this a try. I have read about sugar damaging the skin/collagen, causing free radicals, etc, and so their marketing appealed to me. Upon first use, I was immediately taken aback by the fragrance. This is a highly fragranced product. The scent is hard to describe, but it's sort of like a 'spa smell' that is also fruity. Looking at the ingredient list, ""fragrance"" is the last ingredient, but there is also orange, lemon, tangerine, and rosemary essential oil. If you read up on skincare at all, then you probably know that fragrance and citrus oils are frowned upon in skincare products as being damaging/irritating to the skin.

Despite the fragrance, I continued using it because I don't like to waste things. I figured I'd use it up and just not purchase in the future. Well, after a week of use, my skin seemed very dry. Still oily, but with dry flaky skin. I found this very odd, because typically cream cleansers are moisturizing and the product description says it's hydrating. Well, again, looking at the product ingredients, I see that high on the ingredient list is 'fruit extracts', 'sugar cane extracts' and 'sugar maple extracts', these ingredients act like glycolic acid and salicylic acid, which of course are chemical exfoliants and can cause flaking skin. This is fine if you are looking for an exfoliating cleanser, except the product seems to be marketed as 'gentle', 'moisturizing', and for sensitive skin.

Ingredient list:

water, ppg-3 benzyl ether , myristate, glycerin, polysorbate 20, peg-8, dimethicone, soap bark extract, soapwort root extract, vaccinium myrtillus fruit/leaf extract, sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract, orange fruit extract, lemon extract, betaine, sodium pca, sorbitol, serin, glycine, glutamic, acid, alanine, lysine, arginine, threonine, profile, tangerine oil, rosemary oil, peg-40, hydrogenated castor oil, trideceth-9, acrylates/c10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, panthenol, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, frangrance.",1475798400,2016-10-07

It moisturizes quickly and though leaves a slight tacky feeling, is easily absorbed and soothes my son's skin immediately.

4.0,"I'm a 40 year old male.  I already own another similar device that has ""sonic"" in their name.  I was curious if the LumaRX was better.  Right off the bat it has a rechargeable battery station.  Whereas my ""sonic"" has a plus.  The Luma RX comes with three interchangable heads.  The ""sonic"" comes with one, but you can buy more if you think it's worth the additional expense.  I laughed a little when I saw this came with a massaging brush.  I stopped laughing when I used it.  What a great feature.  I prefer the normal brush over the sensitive brush.  My skin can handle it.  The LumaRX has three speeds.  My ""sonic"" does not.  I have to admit the lowest speed didn't really do it for me.  It may be perfect for sensitive skin, but I like to really feel it.

The LumaRX uses a spinning motion.  My ""sonic"" uses vibration and you provide the circular motion.  There really are benefits to both methods.  On one hand you can rely on LumaRX to do all the physical work, but the ""sonic"" does require very minimal movement by you.  The LumaRX is very light and waterproof.  My ""sonic"" is heavy and waterproof.  Both timers are set to a minute, but I need to hit the power button twice to get my entire face.  Luma RX has a great travel case that stores the brush handle and all the brushes.  My ""sonic"" does not.

So why does a 40 year old man use one of these?  Two reasons.  Aging and shaving.  Mixed with your favorite face wash the LumaRX gives my face an overall smooth feel and certainly picks up my stubble for a close shave.  My ""sonic"" came with it's own face wash (very small amount) and also gives my face and overall smooth feel.  It picks up those pesky whiskers too, and I feel I get a closer shave with it versus the LumaRX.

In the end I prefer my ""sonic"" for it's heft, thick bristle brushes, pulsing power, and close shave results.  However, it is a slight victory.  The LumaRX is a great product that still delivers smooth skin, a clean face, and accessories that you get up front versus buying later.  I am willing to bet those with more sensitive skin will be more than pleased with the LumaRX, even when using the normal brush.",1459641600,2016-04-03

The cream comes out thick, but as soon as I start to spread it around, it softens and spreads very easily, so a little goes a long way. It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated without feeling greasy.

I like this product. It works well and I appreciate that it's unscented, but it doesn't work any better than other lotions and creams I've used that are less expensive.

1.0,"This is my first use of an eyelash conditioner product. The manufacturer says to use once daily for one month before seeing results. I discontinued this after three days. There are multiple warnings on the package saying that we must not get this in our eye or let it touch the skin at the base of the eyelash. This is a very liquid product. There is a very fine line brush. I found the application difficult.  It was very hard for me to apply it to the lash it seemed that when I went from the bottom side the product was not reaching the top half.  This issue is not explained in the directions. When I close my eyes I I was having a very hard time applying it to my eyelashes because I couldn't see over to my other eye due to poor eyesight. It also formed droplets in some locations hanging off of the lashes. I was afraid to blink my eye then because of all the warnings to not let this touch skin or your eyeball. On the last day I had applied it before bedtime and in the morning after washing my fave as usual, a little later on I had a lot of itching and discomfort on the skin around my eyes. I would suggest that the manufacturer add a thickening agent to the product to make it stick on and stay in place and the. It would not form liquid droplets. For me I feel this is too dangerous with all of the warnings And due to my personal challenge with my eyesight. I have just regular myopia plus need reading glasses due to being over 40.

3.0,"applied this Dermablend to half my face, just so I could accurately review my own experience in a comparison with my usual makeup routine. To be fair, note that I don't have the Dermablend foundation and instead used my own mineral liquid foundation, so my results may not be as they'd be with someone who uses both together.

What I found is:
-I couldn't really see a marked difference between one side of my face and the other, as far as how it looked, and I looked under different lights. It may have been a little different but it was so slight that it made it negligible. I didn't want to apply more, but maybe it calls for more, or it calls for the Dermablend foundation to work together.
-The side with the Dermablend powder did set my makeup better. When I took a white tissue and rubbed across both sides of my face, the side without the Dermablend powder had more come away on the tissue than on the side that had the Dermablend powder.
-I didn't see any caking or noticeable powder residue, but I buffed my face really well with a buffing makeup brush after the 2-3 minutes of setting. I will suggest to women who say they have peach fuzz on their face to consider epilators - they run from the gamut of prices so you can find one. Having a smooth face helps your makeup go on smooth, and the powders won't sit atop the skin.
-I didn't feel made up - it didn't sit heavy on my skin.
-it's messy. Be careful opening it the first time, and every time really. The big white powder puff thing is ridiculously puffy-big and you have to work the lid back on over it - I'll likely throw that away and use my big buffing brush on the days I want to use a powder - like if it's going to be humid and I need extra setting (this wouldn't be something I'd need in the dry weather times in the mountains, but I could see needing this when I visit Down South in the humidity!).
-The color looked dark on the white puff when I first looked at it, but on my face it blended nicely.

It's difficult to review this fairly, really, without having the Dermablend foundation. My experience using my own foundation was mixed. But, the Dermablend isn't super expensive and there's enough to last a very long time.

If you need a setting powder and like the Dermablend brand, then I do recommend this. Otherwise, I'm neutral about this product, since I am very happy with the way my regular foundation looks and sets. However, as written above, I'd use this when visiting Down South where it is super humid and I need a little more setting to keep my makeup from sliding off!",1497916800,2017-06-20

I have a mania for serums, I love them, especially anything with hyaluronic acid, and Vichy has amazing products--Vine first introduced me to them, and now they are in CVS Pharmacy. After using this serum for ten days, I can honestly say it WORKS. I used to have noticeable worry lines on my forehead and they have disappeared now. I use this in conjunction with Wakaya sunscreen with dilo oil and also black cumin seed oil, and that is my skin care triple threat!

5.0,"This comes in a lovely bottle that has a classic shape and classic styling.
The Eau De Toilette is not as strong as a perfume, and takes a bit more but is potent and lasting. 1-2 sprays provides a great scent profile for most people. An ounce will last a nice long time in normal use.  The scent itself lasts about 5 hours, but that can vary by person.

This is a woody, green, herbal fragrance that is manly and fresh without being overtly sexy. In the initial spray, basil leads but quickly fades back to being an almost undetectable middle tone that says ""herbal"" really more than ""Basil"". After the dry down, which does not take long, the mandarin is an invigorating top note, while lavender lies just underneath. The base notes of sandalwood with just a tad of vetiver give it a woodsy, earthy fragrance and deep masculinity. Its probably got other notes, these are just the ones that I can distinctly detect. Also, note that in some people, after the dry down, the notes can vary in their lead, so it might seem more floral and sweet on some, if the lavender leads the fragrance on them. For me, and the two guys in my family, the mandarin is predominant.

It's a fairly simple scent composition that's hard not to like.

I can't say whether this product at one time or another had a 3rd party supplier that was less than ethical, but at this time, it is authentic as best I can tell, when compared to a sample sheet that I have, and prior experiences with this product.

The bottle has a nice sprayer. I feel like this is a good scent for all seasons.",1430092800,2015-04-27
5.0,"Appreciation of or attraction to a certain scent is a subjective and relative experience. But there are certain scents that seem to have a near universal appeal.  Those include vanilla, citrus. cinnamon and musk.  But perhaps the most universally agreed upon agreeable scent is the floral group.  The delivery of a gift bouquet of flowers will always create the desired swoon to the recipient both for the delicate natural shapes and colors of nature, but also for the delicious scents they emanate.  The perfumers at Burberry have engineered a scent in this Brit Rhythm Floral that captures the subtle and sensuous tones of nature in just the right blend and strength to produce a near intoxicating effect.  Subtle but confident it conveys the same satisfying and pleasurable emotional response of inhaling a bouquet of roses and lavender. Light, pure, sensual, clean and natural are some adjectives that come to mind. Pretty and feminine are the next words that come to mind.  This is a scent that isn't reserved for a special niche as in a young business woman, or an evening scent or a mature scent.  It has a universal appeal that any age can wear in any circumstance.  It's neither sweet nor heavy but light and playful. It could easily become a woman's signature scent that a woman could appreciate on herself and her partner would immediately relate to and react to from walks past  gardens and ornate displays in high end hotel lobbies.  The scent is packaged in a bottle with an equally subtle design; a simple rectangular glass with a cut glass textured pattern on the surface and a background pink tint.  Like the scent itself, the bottle isn't overpowering or pretentiously trying to make a loud statement. It perfectly compliments this soft sensuous feminine scent.  Hopefully my description hasn't itself been too flowery, but as a male, I really like this scent and would notice and positively react to any woman that passed wearing it.  Honestly my favorite scent I've encountered in a long time. Again, scent and reactions are relative and subjective, but this is definitely a scent to get you subtly noticed and seen as a feminine, soft and positive female.",1447891200,2015-11-19

This stuff is great--I've used it for about a week and the result is that my skin is far less bumpy and more smooth after. It's definitely a touch harsh in that it helps your skin turn over faster, so the areas where I had a breakout scabbed up and fell off over night, resulting in smoother skin afterwards. There's no real perfume or added scent, other than the scent of the glycolic cleanser itself, which smells mildly medicinal. I recommend this for anyone, especially women in their 30's with cystic acne or an uneven texture to their skin.

3.0,"Yes, it is that time for sunscreen again, but note this product does not promote itself as a serious sun protection gel, rather it calls itself an SPF 15 Tanning Gel.  That should alert you right there, this has pretty minimal protection.  I liked the idea of it as I often get too lazy to slap thick white sunscreen on when I go outside, but figured I would be more likely to spray this light gel on before going out.  It smells good and doesn't leave you feeling like you just put car oil all over your body, but I was hoping it would be a lot more natural.  It's 3 main ""protecting"" ingredients are Octinoxate, Octisalate and Oxybenzone.  Octinoxate and Oxybenzone block UVA rays by reflecting them, but they are also penetration enhancers that allow other chemicals to penetrate into your skin better. Oh yippee for that.  I read that they are linked to developmental and reproductive toxicity, and oxybenzone has been linked to cancer and harming the immune system.[...]  I don't necessarily believe everything I read, but I am also not comfortable spreading penetrating chemicals over my body anymore.

I guess it depends what you want to believe is good or bad for you these days.  It is easy enough to do research on the computer and make your own decisions.  This product clearly states what it is and what is in it.  I think it is clear that it is not for fair skinned folk or people who think it will protect them all day out in the sun.  Why complain it doesn't work like an SPF 30 when it doesn't claim it will?  I like the way is smells and goes on, but I will keep looking for a more natural but effective product.",1371081600,2013-06-13

5.0,"Life's too short to mess around in the bathroom all day, but I admit I love trying out products. I've dabbled in a lot of different moisturizers, serums, and creams over the years, both things I bought, Vine review items, and products in friends' showers and bathroom cabinets (yes, I do ask permission!), and this one is a big ol' winner.

I'm in my mid-50s with combination skin that used to be oily. I've been using this serum sparingly -- ONE squirt, which gives you just a wee bit of lotion, but it's very thin and slidey. Maybe I'm just the target audience for it, or maybe it's wishful thinking, but there's a new softness and radiance to my skin.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19
3.0,"The first observation I had for this cream was the packaging. The short wide jar with the threaded cap is a nice idea. The instructions in about one point type along the bottom of the label isn't. It's not like they didn't have plenty of room on the label to print them in a larger font. Fortunately I had read the description and instructions on the Amazon product page prior to selecting this product.

As is my habit, I compared this product to the ones I am presently using. I compared this shave cream to Proraso and Bigelow (which is made by Proraso). I shaved with my Norelco 1250X Senso Touch shaver and a Schick Quattro razor. I shaved with one, two, and four-day growths. When comparing the two shave creams, I lathered half my face with the Baxter product and half my face with my regular brand. Other times I lathered my complete face with the Baxter shaving cream.

To me the product has a slight medicinal smell. Baxter says to apply this cream with a badger brush so I swirled my brush in the jar. The cream has a soft almost whipped consistency, but not a whole lot is picked up by the brush. When applying to my face it really doesn't lather but smears around. It took between three and four brush-fulls the fully lather my face. Adding a slight bit of water helped the little but there really was no lather per se. If you apply this with the dry brush, it feels cold going on your face, where the Proraso is warm because you lather it with a slight bit of hot water. Overall, I prefer the feel of the Proraso shave cream over the Baxter. In comparison, with less than a half an inch ribbon of Proraso whipped into a lather, I can lather my entire face and still have plenty left on the brush.

The medicinal smell lingers while you're shaving but does not remain after you've rinsed it off. There is no tingling or any other sensation, good or bad, when using this cream.

With both the razor and the shaver I received a smooth shave irrespective of the growth. I did however get some razor burn under my chin with both the razor and the shaver, especially with the longer growth, something I don't get with the Proraso. The Baxter seems thicker than the Proraso and does not rinse as cleanly from either the razor or the shaver. It was particularly difficult to rinse from the narrow spaces of the four blade Quattro.

After completing the shave and rinsing my face, my lips still had a soapy taste of them. I had to use a face cloth with soap to wash the taste off.

The Wife Test: As always, when comparing two shaving products I ask Mrs. Boilermate to evaluate each side of my face. She said she could tell no difference between the side lathered with Baxter and the side lathered with Proraso. Both were very smooth in her opinion.

Bottom Line: I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this premium shave cream. It goes on fairly smoothly and generally gives a close shave. For that I give it three stars. The scent, while not my favorite, is not offputting either. But it doesn't really lather when applied as directed, and doesn't rinse as cleanly, especially when using a multi-blade razor. It also takes more brush-fulls to get a fully lathered face. The soapy aftertaste on my lips is something I've never experienced with any shaving cream, foam, gel, or soap in my many years of shaving.

Overall, there's not enough to like for me to continue to use this product.",1373500800,2013-07-11

3.0,"The proprietary and Trademarked ingredient NIA-114 in this StriVechtinLABS 5-Minute Weekly Glycolic Peel was invented by two biochemists searching for a cure to skin cancer. NIA-114 is a unique and patented technologically advanced form of Niacin that nourishes the skin surface to address multiple visible signs of aging and give skin a more healthy and radiant appearance. This product contains 5% NIA-114.

This 5-Minute Weekly Glycolic Peel, with powerful glycolic acid, alpha hydroxy acid and NIA-114 indicates it will revitalize, hydrate, and transform skin.

Instantly, it declares it will: enhance luminosity and radiance for a youthful glow, help improve skin clarity and smooth the skin surface so that makeup application is easier and more even.

After four weeks, it declares it will: diminish the appearance of lines and wrinkles, refine skin texture, leave appearance of pores less prominent.

I've been using this for about four weeks (3/27 thru today 4/26). I've used the product five times. This is a two-step process: 1) Detoxifying Primer and 2) AHA Activator. I definitely feel a tingling sensation during use, and that's okay and to be expected (it's potent and it's working). I only used this on certain areas and I would say that where I've used it, my skin texture is slightly improved and pores appear slightly less prominent. Lines and wrinkles appear about the same.

I find the ""sunburn alert"" precaution inconvenient. Because of the AHA in this product, there is a ""Sunburn Alert."" AHA may increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of a sunburn. A caution on the box suggests that you use sunscreen and limit sun exposure for a week after using this.

4.0,"This item was given to me for my review.
The Jouer Moisturizing Lip Gloss is a very pretty sheer petal pink color that is, thankfully, unfrosted. Any shine comes from the gloss itself. I find the color is perfect for summer and very natural looking. For those of us who are graying, and perhaps lost some color in our face, as well, it is a good choice of color to add that youthful blush. For young ladies, it is a nice, natural color that would look very nice if you want to have a pretty mouth, but not go overboard...like when you are playing up your eyes. So, color-wise, I find this to be perfect for pasty little me. The point off is in the rather oily texture. The gloss IS moisturizing, and my lips felt nice even after it had worn off, but I wasn't as fond of the oiliness. I will enjoy the tube I have now, and I might purchase again if I need a gloss, but I would like to find this very same color in a lipstick, I think.",1399420800,2014-05-07

4.0,"This is a beautifully made grooming kit. Each of the five pieces -- (1) slant tweezer, 2) facial-hair scissors, 3) nail clipper, 4) nail cleaner/cuticle pusher and 5) nail file -- feels not only solid but also, like any well-designed tool, sits well in the hand. Each tool is weighty enough to signal the quality of the metal, but none of the tools feels heavy or awkward to use. And the sturdy carrying case is small enough to fit easily in a purse, bag or briefcase. Heck, it might even fit in a large pocket. To logically fit five decently sized tools into a handy case with a small footprint -- that's first-rate design.

Overall, this is a great grooming kit, handsomely packaged in its leather container. That said, I only give five stars to products that are great in terms of both their make and their value; a true five-star product is a super product at a super price. This is a super product at a reasonable price -- it's not overpriced for what it is, but it's not a super value. Hence one star is lost.

Also, this kit loses a bit of credibility with me because the nail file has a blemish in the steel of its handle. It's visibly noticeable; at first glance it looks like a scratch, but when you look at it closely, it seems to be an imperfection in the metal itself -- a greenish sort of zigzag scuff. For an item offered at this price, each kit should have been given more attention by the quality-control folks. If you bought this and had Amazon ship directly to someone as a gift, you wouldn't have had a chance to look over the items before the recipient received them.

5.0,The Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation has been working very well for my wife.  It provides excellent coverage without adding additional oiliness to her already oily skin.  The color cream is a good match for my light to medium color complexion.  The foundation includes SPF 25 which is a necessity for her since we live in sunny Southern California.  Since the coverage is better than the products she has used in the past she needed to use less product to avoid settling in pores and avoiding a heavy look.  She likes her makeup to look natural and she achieves that goal by smoothing the product around her face and using a small amount of foundation.  Her skin would definitely look too oily if she used more foundation and did not smooth it evenly around her face.  It seemed to last throughout the day despite her oily skin.  She would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for good coverage with sufficient sun protection.,1497484800,2017-06-15

But by mid afternoon, my hair is all flat and frizzy.  It looks like a pyramid.  I liked this product because it helped support the curls without turning my hair into cement.

I liked this product early in the day. My hair felt natural.  It made my curls not as curly, but at least existent.  Generally, the weight of my hair really just straightens it and makes it all frizzy eventually.  So I start out great but as the day goes on, the curls straighten and the frizz comes back.  By dinnertime, my hair needs to be pulled back or put up.  That was the flaw using this product.

Fortunately, it absorbed into my skin and wasn't too dark at all. The scent is a very light, mild scent that isn't too overpowering which works well for me and my sensitivity to strong scents.

I have very sensitive skin that breaks out at the slightest provocation. Most moisturizers and sunscreens will make my face break out terribly. So far, this has not caused a breakout in my skin.

4.0,"The XEN-TAN transformation ultra weekly tan is a bit different than most self tanners. You apply the lotion then depending on how dark you want your color, you wait anywhere from 45 minutes to three hours to let it develop before washing it off. This makes it the most complicated self tanner I have used and takes a real commitment to getting a decent result.
The end result was a nice, rich color but for me not worth the time consuming application process. The cost is also a deterrent even though this is a quality product. I would use this in anticipation of a special event but it's too much work to use as my regular self tanner. The quick drying time of the XEN-Tan mousse fits my lifestyle much better with comparable results.",1448150400,2015-11-22

I am wearing this on my toes right now.  I've had it on for a few days and it still looks wonderful.  (Granted, my toenail polish usually lasts a long time.)  It went on smoothly and wasn't drippy.  The brush is a bit narrow but that really helps with edges and smaller toes.  This was opaque in two coats and it dried quickly.  I put it on over a base coat (blues and greens sometimes stain my nails) and finished with Seche Vite fast dry topcoat.  It has a lovely shine when dry.

This is a five-free polish (as are all Zoya polishes).  Although my bottle was kind of old, this went on smoothly and wasn't sticky or goopy.

3.0,"This is a gentle facial cleanser that is void of nasty chemicals that can damage skin over time. It has a clean, neutral smell and doesn't leave the skin feeling too parched or tight. I had some concerns from the get-go, notably the sugar-filled ingredients like White Grape Juice and Sweet Cherry Juice. Sugar, in every form, doesn't belong in or on your body and especially not on your face. Still, I figured that since the cleanser would be washed off right away it wouldn't be that big of a deal. In the end, I don't know if the sugary ingredients caused the problem or if this cleanser just isn't strong enough for my skin, but I found that I broke out more than usual while using it and had to stop.

I really did want to like it. There wasn't a residue feeling on my face after using it, it was fragrance free and all-natural, but my skin simply requires something more potent to keep the blemishes at bay. It might work well as an 'in-between' wash when you just want a clean feeling without a rigorous scrub. Still, the sugar content makes me nervous. In the end, I'm sure it works for some people and not for others. It just didn't work for me.",1417824000,2014-12-06

It is just 0.3 ounces.  For a bit more, you could buy a better quality product like MAC or any one of a number of brands sold at Sephora.

I think the shades are accurate for the various complexions for which they are made.  I chose Fair/Neutral as I have somewhat fair, medium tone skin and this blends in well.

The product is not overly oily.  It feels more creamy than it does greasy.  It goes on well and a very light application goes a long way.  It does cover well, but it is over-priced for what it is.

We followed the directions and waited for 10 mins to wash it off. His skin looked the same No noticeable difference in the pore size.
I used the face wash and loved it. It was the only product that did not smell bad. My son also tried it and he also liked it the best. The cream again was not something that was spectacular. There many other creams such as Aveeno and Nivea that work better.

5.0,"This butter LONDON Bronzer Clutch is a beautiful quality color palette that comes in a lovely 4-1/2"" x 3"" compact. Inside, the compact has three warm brown shades of bronzer/contour makeup, an ""On The Glow"" highlighting pen and a nice quality mirror. The bronzer/contour makeup is rich in color and a velvety smooth texture that reminds me of a high-end eye shadow. The frame of the compact lifts up so individual contour colors can be changed out and new ones can be added. The compact closes tightly and doesn't leak, so I can carry it in my purse just as it is, or I can carry it in my cosmetic bag.

My makeup routine has been dull for years now (concealer, powder foundation, blush, mascara and lipstick), and my fair but olive skin tone can look drab. It's really fun to switch up my routine by using this bronzer/contour palette. I don't have a contour brush, so I use a blush brush to apply and blend the colors, and it works just fine. This makeup adds such a warm glow that lifts my skin tone and adds some much needed definition and contour to my face. I'm just learning about contour makeup and am so pleased with how easy it is to apply and blend this makeup for a smooth appearance. And I love the results- this contour makeup creates the illusion of higher cheekbones and even makes my face look slimmer.

I'm still practicing how best to use this palette, so I appreciate the included tips that show how to accentuate features, achieve definition and get a natural looking glow by blending the darkest color in my cheek hollows followed by the bronze color on my cheekbones, and the lightest shade at the top. The instructions show how to use the highlighting pen for added contouring and enhancement of lips and eyes. It really just takes a little experimentation to see what looks best on me, and so far I'm really happy with how little effort it takes to achieve a really flattering look. The bronzer/contour color is made in the USA, and the gold highlighter is made in Korea. This is a gorgeous product that I definitely recommend.",1468972800,2016-07-20
3.0,"It's hard to purchase makeup online.  I had to base color selection for this on other brands I've used in the past that suit my blonde, blue-eyed complexion.  That's anything in the beige/light tan line.  Looking at the Amazon description pictures, medium looked perfect for my complexion color.  What I received is too light, and the packaging makes it impossible to grind different proportions of light/dark ingredients.  It's also impossible to tell when this product is running low because the grinder top is permanently affixed.  I have included what both colors look like when mixed, and it is much lighter than any of the Amazon description pictures, and much too light on my face without being noticeable.

To date Amazon only sells two colors of Scott-Vincent Borba foundation, so I started snooping around online to see if this was available in darker shades.  Yes, it is, but the real surprise is that it is sold much cheaper elsewhere and includes a perfecting brush.  I can't afford to make such costly mistakes.

I tried it in my hair a second time and I liked it much better. You have to give it a minute to dry and then you can style your hair. It makes my hair more manageable (not softer) but easier to style. It is a little messy on the hand that I use to part my hair. I, like another reviewer find it works best if you part your hair and spray at the root. I part thin sections and keep doing that until I don't see my scalp. It covers my gray a lot too. I haven't dyed my hair in years. I use to have medium to dark brown hair but now I have a lot of gray too. I don't dye it now because it is thinning. This stuff makes my hair look a lot less gray. It does make your hair feel a little weird but it looks great! I love the fibers but I love this even more. I sometimes use them together. The spray is much quicker and easier for me to use.

The reason is that I have sensitive skin and it seems slightly more red and I have a few breakout spots now. I cannot say for sure, however, that this redness or those breakout spots are related to this Purete Themale cleanser. To its credit, when I use it and follow it up with the Vichy Mineral Water, I sometimes forget to apply moisturizer because with the Vichy routine my skin feels already moisturized. The product also makes my skin feel tighter and firmer so I don't have visible pores. In combination with the mineral water this seems to be a good product for most but if you have exceptionally sensitive skin you might want to try it as a small purchase first and then decide for yourself before buying more..",1493942400,2017-05-05
5.0,"The wife and I just returned from a week-long stay at a beach resort and during that time my wife made extensive use of this Obagi Sun Shield Tint SPF 50 Sunscreen.

So a little setup first; my wife describes herself as pasty-white and the description isn't too far off. It's not because she's an indoors loving recluse but more related to her family lineage. Prior to our vacation she'd been visiting her favorite spa to spray-tan and get a little color. During our vacation, she used the Obagi Tint Sunscreen to essentially touch up her spray-tan and keep a nice bronze color.

She loves this sunscreen so much that she talked me into trying it and I can see why she's a fan. This sunscreen offers excellent protection (SPF 50) and both she and I did not burn at all. The sunscreen goes on very easily and is a less viscous than some of the other sunscreen's we brought along and regularly use. Since this product goes on so easily you'll get a nice amount of coverage per dollop of sunscreen. The tinting effect is very nice as well and goes on evenly thanks in large part to how easy the sunscreen rubs onto the skin.

I normally avoid products that offer tinting because I'm paranoid about getting the tint on my clothes. The Obagi sunscreen does a great job staying put once dry. The resort we visited featured white linens and bed sheets and we didn't get any of the tint on any of those items. Naturally you'll want to use some caution when using this sunscreen for the first time. I'd apply it and wash my hands immediately and then let the sunscreen dry fully before putting on clothes.

This is definitely a product my wife and I will buy and a great, easy way to get a little bit of color without having to tan. Recommended!",1491609600,2017-04-08

While I usually don't have acne, I've been traveling to different climates over the last month and have suddenly begun to break out.  I just started using the Effacer Acne System and it's helped calm my skin down and get rid of the zits.

The system has a cleanser, a toner and a clear ointment.  The cleanser is light, unscented and left my skin with a slight tingly feeling but it didn't feel stripped or overly dry.  I applied it on the affected areas, let it dry and then used the ointment on the affected areas only.  Within 3 days, my skin has mainly cleared up.  I'll continue to use it until all the zits have disappeared.  It's effective and i'll use it again when I have a breakout.  It's a good system to have in hand.",1445212800,2015-10-19
5.0,"This took a day or two of getting used to . . . a cream type deodorant delivered from a tube.  First time I used a fingertip to deliver a small amount.  The second time, I discovered that the domed spout on the tube can serve as a spreading device.  Just squeeze out a small amount (1/2"" or less, and it comes out in a very thin stream), then spread on using the tube tip.  No mess, and no residue on fingers.  How does it work?

Awesome.  Very effective deodorant AND antiperspirant action.  The antiperspirant quality is not mentioned on the product page or label, but this deodorant contains aluminum salts does indeed does perform exceptionally well as an antiperspirant.  Truly fragrance free.  Also alcohol-free, paraben-free, and hypoallergenic.  Non-irritating.  Dries completely shortly after application leaving no wetness or greasiness.  Only difference from clean skin is that you can feel a slight drag as you slide you fingertip across a treated area.

Made in France.  I tried this out with skepticism, not expecting to like it.  I've found it to be a really superior deodorant product.  I love it.

UPDATE after several days use:  I was getting irritation.  Not visible, but my skin burned.  I cut the application dosage back to no more than pea-size, spread around well with my fingertip.

A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20

3.0,"I may return this.

I haven't swatched these, because I'm trying to decide if I want to return this.  I quite possibly will. The colors look completely different in person.

First of all, I bought this at the discounted $23 price, so my expectations were on par with that price.  I watched several youtube reviews, so I expected the quality to have highs and lows within the palette.  (I haven't used or swatched these colors, so I don't know how well they work).  What I CAN say is that the colors in the palette in person are darker and muddier than the clear pure looking colors on the listing image.  Kind of reminds me of the muddy quality in a lot of e.l.f. eyeshadow palettes (and I'm not a fan of those palettes).

I'm not sure if .em cosmetics is retooling/relaunching/transitioning or simply defunct now?  No clue, but if they are, the color clarity of actual product compared to advertised images might be why.

Overall, I'm already very disappointed in this item.  VERY.  However, since it was fairly inexpensive, I may keep is, as I could forsee getting $20 worth of use out of it.  Not all the colors are unappealing, but none of them are the color from the product image.  NONE of them.

Don't pay more than 23.50 for this, and don't buy it because you are in love with the colors in photo.  I was personally looking forward to the large number of light and bright colors that looked like possibilities as a base and highlighter colors.  That was the use I had in mind for this. To be able to pull from it for a lot of those (mixing in other palettes I own).  That won't be possible. (ETA: Actually, there ARE several lighter colors, but they look darker before swatched; however, there are NOT as many light colors as the photo indicates.) If you want a range of mid-tone to dark-ish near neutrals this might suit.  There's not ONE good brow bone color in the lot.

Update: I am not removing my original statements (above) but I am revising my star rating.  And I am adding some positives (and a couple more specific negatives) now that I have swatched and used.  First, there are more light browbone/inner eye/highlight colors than was my initial impression when the product arrived. Still, many of the light colors are darker in person.

Some of the colors are lovely, soft, blendable.  Others are a smudgy mess.  A few (few) are weird in their pigmentation; it's as if the pigments aren't evenly distributed in the pan; one swipe is not as an intense as the next.  All of the blushes/highlighters have more of a coral tinge than anticipated (not a fan of corals). However, for those of us with light skin, the soft bronzer is light pleasant option for when you don't really want a strong bronzer.  With that said, I wonder if that color would be useful for those with darker skin. I tried following the tutorials for the sample looks for each palette; most of those are...not as flattering as other options you have with this palette.  There are a couple colors I LOVE though, and it's been fun to play with.  A couple of the mid browns and the deep purples are really nice.  I've tried some colors that I would not have otherwise bought, and some of them I've liked.  (The pink in the lower left quadrant is, however, hideously unwearable; it's the only truly regrettable color, and it is one of the ones with the irregular pigmentation as well.)

And the Lipsticks!  I have serious positives and negatives to say about them.  I popped out the discs to examine the depth of the pan before making this comment: The amount of product is ridiculous!  I've seen free samples in blister packs with more product in them!  Just a joke.  However, in a TUBE form, I would buy these in a heartbeat.  Some colors I like, some I don't, but I LOVE the formula.  Really nice smooth, cushioning one-swipe color.

Also, the listing mentioned the small palette as if it were included.  It is NOT.

I totally think it's worth the $20.  But there are enough negatives that make it's original price just silly.",1482278400,2016-12-21

Normally, Japonesque is a trusted brand for me, so I'm not sure what happened here.

As for the color correcting, yeah, it works well with fingers or a brush to conceal redness, but it didn't work any better than my concealer alone.

3.0,"According to the box, this H2O PLUS WATERBRIGHT ILLUMINATING NIGHT CREAM (1.7 ounce) is ""clinically proven to enhance skin's radiance, clarity, evenness, complexion, brightness, and texture, all while reducing the intensity of dark spots.""  If the company says it, it must be true--and I certainly want to believe it.  But I can't help wondering how you clinically test things like ""clarity"", ""radiance"", and ""brightness"" of skin?

When I applied this cream to my face at bedtime, it felt fine at first, then it started to sting.  (I do have sensitive skin, so a lot of products produce this effect.)  The stinging subsided after 5-10 minutes.  However, the strong floral fragrance stuck around for hours, and made me even consider getting out of bed to wash it off.  (One does hope that regular boyfriends and husbands generally like this fragrance.)

The next morning my face looked about the same as always, but I'm sure you need to use the cream regularly to see any beneficial results.  Also, the box says, ""For optimal results use with Waterbright Illuminating Serum.""  The serum is also available on Amazon (about $50 for 1 ounce).

The night cream's dispensing jar is nice, though it's confusing if you haven't encountered one like it before.  You remove the flip-off top, then push down on the screw-off top until cream comes up through the center hole.  One push dispenses enough for a single application, so you don't waste this expensive cream (about $54 for 1.7 ounce on Amazon).

If you can afford this H2O PLUS line of skin care products, then I say go for it.  Because this night cream appears to be an effective skin moisturizer, I rate it at 3 stars (""It's okay"" on the official Amazon scale).",1479168000,2016-11-15
4.0,"Baxters has become my new favorite line of products after being an American Crew and Redken guy for the last 10 years.
Normally I buy the Hard Water Pomade but I'm actually really liking this clay.

The clay has a different smell, a bit more ""piney"" or herbal smelling, and isn't really good at going on dry if you have fine hair but if you add I few drops of water and warm it up it goes on easy and has great hold.

The lotion is awesome, hardly any fragrance, and leaves my face feeling good all day. Not too greasy or anything either.

The deodorant is the only part of this kit I don't like, and only because of the smell. It's not a feminine smell at all which is good, it's more of a natural herbal kinda smell, but it's really strong. Really, don't bother wearing cologne with this stuff.
But beyond the smel it did a great job of keeping me from stinking and unlike a lot of other deodorants it didn't give me a rash. Apparently i have sensitive armpits and most stuff makes me break out. Wore this 3 days in a row and had no issues.
So if you like the smell (which I do) and don't mind how strong it is (which I do) then this is a great deodorant.

The lettering is tiny and hard to read, but once we deciphered it, it did nothing to take away the ""Hot Scrub"" mystery.  We also found no sign of the tingling or warming.

5.0,"Japonesque makeup setting spray absorbs quickly and prolongs the application of your makeup. It is transparent and doesn't dry skin.  The product prevents fading and transfer, providing a freshly applied look.

This product is intended to be used after applying makeup with eyes tightly closed.  The product should be sprayed evenly over the face.

You might think something like this would smell bad but it is a light scent which isn't overpowering or unpleasant.

The product goes on kind of wet and takes some time to dry on.  It does not seem to induce a shine and it doesn't detract from the makeup application.

In terms of longevity or the product standing up to its claims, this product does seem to work for those long term events, special occasions or situations where you will want to keep your freshly applied makeup looking good for a prolonged period of time.

The product was tested in a low humidity (SoCal, 8% RH) environment in November as well as a colder environment (Boston, light snow) and a high humidity environment (Central FL, 80% RH).  The temperature and humidity extremes didn't seem to affect the product's effectiveness.

I wear undereye concealer and it is a challenge to get it on in a non-conspictuous way.  I have tried other products, including baby oil which can be problematic because of the fact that it is runny if you get too much on. It just cannot look matte or dry or it shows every line. I do not like to putmy SPF 30 moisturizer so close to my eye either as it stings my eyes.

Putting this on every morning and night is recommended. It is made with some really exotic ingredients which are featured above.  This is opthomologist tested - No paraben  - YAY and non allergenic. I think this is a phenomenal product and I would spend serious cash to rebuy it. Just the feeling of it going on is what really gives me more incentive to use it.

1.0,"This product has a pretty strong fragrance, and as far as I know, it does not have sunscreen ingredients. After a couple of painful experiences, I have decided to skin test every skin product I am ever interested in wearing. I'm glad I tested this using a TINY dot on the belly of my arm near my wrist instead of putting it on my face.

Within 24 hours, hives started on the spot I tested.

The consistency is pretty thick, and the color is appropriate for my fair, East Asian skin. I was hoping it would not cause me issues, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this to anyone who has very sensitive skin like me. However, I have to be fair - the only reason I decided to try it was because it had a score of 3 from EWG skindeep, which means it's not very toxic. Although this is a new product, so it doesn't really have much data yet on EWG either. Try at your own risk if you are sensitive.

I thought that my skin allergy was related to chemical sunscreen ingredients, but I am beginning to think it's something else, or in addition t the sunscreen. I'm guessing I may also be sensitive to fragrance, which is the only thing in this product that got a dangerous score of 8 on EWG.

In case anyone wonders about what else I am allergic to so that it may help you decide on whether to try this, I am very allergic to the Mary Kay Time Wise sunscreen as well as the Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration SPF 30

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

The bristle is more dense and slightly rougher than the than the sensitive brush. So this helped with exfoliating my skin and helping with my dry skin issues. My face was smoother and firmer in just one use. I live in Illinois and the weather here is rough in winter and my skin has a lot of dry patches. This has helped my skin to better absorb the various products(serums, masks and moisturizers) i use.

When I got the chance to review this shave cream I thought it would be something different since I have tried several expensive blades but never a shave cream at this price.  The cream itself had a great scent and is easy to apply.  Unfortunately because it does not really lather or foam it is hard to tell how much is needed. I tried shaving with this using safety razors as well as a blade and it never was as comfortable or smooth as a regular shave gel.  The only place where this worked really well was in trimming my side burns because it was clear and I could easily see how much I was shaving.

5.0,"My teenage son loves this product. The 1st can I bought at the barber lasted him a year!!! That's amazing to me, so I don't mind spending more than your average cost of  a hair product bc it's totally worth it! He has very thick Italian hair with the pompadour cut/style. Use it on dry hair and make sure you lather/work it very well in your hands before applying. It holds his style all day long through school, gym and sports!! A regular men's Pomade just doesn't hold the hair back and keep it in place after an hour or so, especially if you go to the gym or do any kind of sports. My husband tried it in his hair, which btw is not thick at all and has started thinning a little bit, and he doesn't care for it. But that's not really the type of product he should be using for his hair type. Now if you have thick, coarse or a longer cut/style you'll love it!!! No other product has held up as well, and we've tried them all. It smells so fresh and clean too. I love the scent! Layrite cement is truly an unbeatable quality product!! Great seller, fast shipping, packaged securely. We will definitely be repurchasing here when it gets low.

The Crabtree & Evelyn ultra moisturizing hand therapy, by contrast, has that lasting effect. It goes on and does not feel greasy or weird. My hands actually did feel softer for the entire day and over time. I felt like this cream was perfect for combating the effects of the current weather on my skin - cold and dry. Also, it smells fresh and natural, which was another thing I quite liked.",1456185600,2016-02-23

4.0,"If the color had been a better match for me, it would have been almost perfect. Its possible that, as I get a little darker in the summer, it might be a better match. Right now, I had to remove some of it (using a slightly moist cotton pad) because it was a poor match for my skin color. The light beige color, which sounds like it should be a good match for me is OK in intensity but leans towards a light-colored band aid color that has too much tint for my skin. Objectively speaking, I have more yellow in my skin and this shade has more brownish-pink.

It is easy to apply. It goes on smoothly without leaving tracks or demarcation lines. The more you smooth it on, the better it absorbs. I like the way it evens out skin color. I have tiny little red veins that make me look as if Im overdoing the blush powder and this crme covers it up without a painted-on look (even though it is less yellow than it should be). It also fills the pores just enough for smoothness and without looking artificial. I have very dry skin, but it feels light when wearing it and is easy to remove at the end of the day. Even though I was at an outdoor event that started during a warm late afternoon and went on to around 11 in the evening, the coverage was undisturbed by sweating or the passage of time. Photographs taken (with a lens that is very unforgiving) looked natural and did not reflect flash spots. Many friends commented on how good and relaxed I looked and asked if I had lost weight. Go figure!

The one star that I took off a perfect rating was not for the color mis-match. It is because it is only a finish. Granted, it is a good finisha little face powder and maybe blush and you're at your absolute best. But it doesnt contain SPF protection (a must in Florida) or a moisturizer (although, frankly, it feels soft as if it doesmaybe its the hyaluronic acid?). You must first lay a foundation of those basic products and then add this as the final touchtoo many steps for everyday use. This makes it somewhat less practical and more labor intensive than an all-in-one product. Its something I will use for special occasions when I want to look really good for a really long time.",1524441600,2018-04-23

3.0,"Rating Explanation: 3.5 stars for how it did make my skin shimmer nicely. 2.0 stars for the pricing of Crepe Erase products. 2.0 for the too-strongly-floral scent, and how it seems to dry out my hands a little.

Description: relatively large tube (but at this review it's a little over $28 a tube), thick cream-white, and a floral/citrus scent.

Testing: I applied the Crepe Erase to my right hand and my Vaseline Intensive Care to my left hand--rubbing it in circular motions as the Crepe Erase instructions indicated. Then I compared how it felt applying and what my hands looked like side-by-side. The Crepe Erase is a little more ""greasy"" while my regular lotion soaked into my skin more readily. Comparing my hands, there wasn't a lot of difference except that the Crepe Erase hand seemed to have a bit of a shine to it--perhaps some kind of light-reflecting ingredient.

But the weird thing is that I notice while the Crepe Erase is more emollient going on, it tends to, ironically, dry out my hands. When I first opened the product and applied it to my hands, I did notice later on my hands felt dry but I thought it was from something else I did during the day. I wasn't sure about this until I applied Crepe Erase to my right and Intensive Care to my left hand, and sure enough, the hand with Crepe Erase, 20 minutes later, is more dry feeling while the Vaseline Intensive Care hand still feel soft and supple--hmmm - I wonder about this.

I then applied the Crepe Erase to my body, arms, legs. Again it's a little greasy going on, but eventually soaks in. There was that same light-reflecting ""shimmery"" look--I've seen this with some other types of moisturizers so again I assume it's something in the ingredient. I do like this, even if temporary.

Company Claims: The company makes a lot of claims about how gross aging skin is and how they will make our skin look younger again. Well, aside from the fact that it'd be nice to be able just to age normally while still taking good care of our body and skin by eating right, exercise, using sunscreen, and drinking plenty of water, as for the claims of making my skin ""younger looking,"" there is really no way to tell what this product is doing at a cellular level to change my skin below the surface other than having that documented scientifically/dermatological over time. Unless the results are dramatic enough that I can see them right in front of me. However, my thoughts are that if one really wants a change to aging skin (aside from the healthy living we should all do), one would have to do more than Crepe Erase to get there--retinoids or Botox or surgery, oh my! While there may be some slight changes, this ""over the counter"" cream probably isn't going to work miracles--however, until I try it over at least a month, I have to give it some benefit of the doubt. However, for the price, even with small changes, it would give me pause. I am willing to give it a go to see over the next month if it will-if I can stand the scent and the slight drying effect on my skin.

I'm not particularly fond of the scent--there is almost a rose-scented aspect to it even if it doesn't have rose in it, and that's one of my least-favorite scents. It doesn't dissipate quickly, so I'm a little put off by that highly floral scent lingering.

Research on Product:  The ingredients list shows a lot of hydrating - emollient - ingredients--like shea/cocoa butter, and oils like olive/coconut that can really moisturize your skin - a good thing there. There is dimethicone in it--that's an ingredient in the make-up primers you can put on your face before your foundation to allow the foundation to ""sit"" on your skin--that may be why it doesn't absorb quickly, and why it makes the skin look a bit smoother--but I also know that if you massage your skin, it will cause a slight inflammatory response that will make your skin swell a little and that in itself will smooth out some wrinkles.

In all my research, I could not find anything on TruFirm - an ingredient in Crepe Erase. For all I know it may do the job of smoothing out skin on a more permanent level, but with continued use of this product, and the other two that go with it when they arrive, I will do everything they instruct and then see if my skin shows any difference, and if I note a difference that makes the cost of these products worth it (and I'm very skeptical), then I will come back here and tell you all.

Final Observations: I am put off by the cost of these Crepe Erase products, and unless I see something dramatic over the weeks of use of this product and the body buffing and body repair, which are super expensive, I can't ever imagine spending that kind of money on a non-prescription product that has an ingredient for which no one seems to know what it is or what it does to my skin. However, if there are dramatic results, I will certainly come back here and tell you all about it.

I am skeptical but willing to give it a continued-use try.

4.0,"Lathers up really nicely, and has a very neutral scent. I don't have that much facial hair to shave off, but it's still nice to get this lather going and to have a very smooth shave. Much appreciate.",1482537600,2016-12-24
5.0,"I've been using Dermablend for years but had never tried this powder -- and I can't believe what I was missing. I've used and loved both the liquids like Flawless Creator and the solids like Cover Creme, but nothing from Dermablend or any other company has ever covered messed-up spots as fast or as flawlessly as this powder. When I have a horrible zit or a red, rough patch or anything else that is not only discolored but has a different texture from the rest of my face, this is what I reach for. I put just a bit on one corner of the included sponge and just dab it on the spot and it's GONE. And it's totally opaque, and best of all it's matte and because it's powder it doesn't settle into grooves or accentuate rough skin; it just sits on top and conceals everything. The first time I used it I was in such bad shape and I had to go to a client meeting, and when I tried this I nearly cried with relief. I hope you're never so desperate, but if you are, may you know the reassurance of having this on hand.

Here's a tip to make sure that this is really invisible on your skin: If you don't know your Dermablend color, order a free sample kit from Dermablend's site before you order. You can't trust your monitor's colors and color matching is very precise with Dermablend, so it's critical to get it right.",1526774400,2018-05-20
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20

It has a strong scent that lasts for quite a while. It's a nice flowery scent, but it is very intense. This is a very thick moisturizer and seems to do a great job, I just prefer a less powerful scent. It's not something you could use if you wear a perfume. I didn't feel like it was greasy or took too long to absorb.

Overall, it's nice, but I wouldn't buy it again because the scent is too strong for me.",1531785600,2018-07-17
5.0,"The Clarisonic Deep Pore Brush Head fits my old Clarisonic Pro and new Mia Fit I splurged on last week. I usually use the delicate brush head for daily use as my skin is sensitive, but I was interested to try the Deep Pore Brush Head as I get a few clogged pores along the sides of my nose. So far, I like the Deep Pore Brush Head a lot. The bristles are softer than expected, and it feels stimulating without being irritating to my skin. I'm not sure it minimizes my pores, but the problem pores by my nose look clearer and better as it gets rid of white gunk I still get sometimes, plus this brush does a great job clearing the rest of my skin of makeup, dirt, and dead skin. My skin looks and feels great afterwards and absorbs my face serum and cream really well. I love using a Clarisonic and part of the experience is that the brushes are great quality, including this Deep Pore Brush Head. Definitely recommended.

5.0,"I change mascaras about once a month since I have a whole shoebox full of them.  This is the most recent one I grabbed.  And I am a big fan.

First off, I like the brush.  I felt like I was coating my eyelashes very well, but the shape prevented me from getting mascara all over my brow bone (this *is* a problem for poorly-shaped brushes).  So that was great.  (For reference, I generally only use mascara on my upper lashes.)

Second, it doesn't irritate my eyes.  I just got through with a Tarte mascara that became a little irritating after wearing it all day, so the lack of irritation is a relief.  (I have somewhat sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses.)  Also, for what it's worth, it lasts all day at the office for me.

Third, the appearance is quite nice.  I thought this thickened and lengthened my lashes nicely.  As with most mascaras, the name (""huge extreme"") is hyperbole, but it did have a dramatic effect.  The color was a dark black, exactly what I'm looking for.

Fourth, it was not too hard to get off.  I am using Lancome Bi-Facil dual phase makeup remover right now and a bit of that on a cotton pad is all I need to remove this along with my eyeliner and eyeshadow.  If, after cleansing my face, there is a bit of mascara under my eyes, I use some micellar water on a cotton pad to take it off.  This is not such a problem with this mascara, but I've had to do so once or twice so I figured I would mention it.

Anyway, I'm happy with pretty much all aspects of the performance of this mascara.  If I didn't have about 60 others to go through, I would definitely buy this again.",1464739200,2016-06-01

3.0,"Well... it goes like this: if you really, really want to smell like 'old men' after the shower, try the Man Made Wash because will. Seriously.

I suppose it's supposed to be a 'old fashion' but I tend to be allergic to fragrances and this is one body wash my body or skin is not super enthusiastic about. My standard for a 'good' body wash is one that does not smell at all and does not suppress the skin's natural and healthy odor. But the Man Made seems to aggressively attempt to replace that with some combination of stale tobacco, old leather and sweat which maybe make some feel good or more manly but it makes me want to go back to the shower and wash again with something else to get this odor off.

My three star rating stand for: ""if it's not good for me, it doesn't mean that everyone should avoid it."" Because it does the wash part. It's only the smell that makes me disagree.",1474156800,2016-09-18

5.0,"I have used Mario Badescu products for years--I have often alternated and tried other brands to see if I can duplicate the results I see with this drying lotion, but few brands come close (the one that comes closest for me is Clinique's acne solutions spot healing gel--I actually keep both on hand in case one type of stubborn pimple reacts better to one than the other!).

One of the things I love most about MB products is that they have fewer ingredients and do not irritate my skin.  Whenever possible I try to use more natural products on my skin and I regularly use a variety of cleansing masks along with my clarsonic in order to keep my skin clear.  This drying lotion can sometimes sting a little when I put it on if I tried squeezing a pimple (yes, I know, against the rules..but it happens!), but if I use this before bed I will wake up and find that my large red pimples have shrunk significantly overnight.  Depending on the size of the breakout sometimes it disappears completely within a day!

Of all of the MB products that I have tried this my favorite acne treatment solution--I believe anyone who has acne prone sensitive skin would find it extremely beneficial.  The best way to apply it is to use a clean q-tip and dip it through the clear solution and down into the pink powder at the bottom.  It is the combination of these two ingredients that will help to clear breakouts.

I always wear either Urban Decay's Primer Potion or Tarte's eye primer, and this plays nicely with both of those.  It lasts all day when applied over primer, and is a pretty neutral color.  For more pop, I've also added a teal or green eyeliner, but you can tone this down by using black or brown eyeliner along with it.

I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.",1357689600,2013-01-09

2.0,"This didn't work for me.

It produced puffiness, which is really not the sort of wrinkle minimizing I hoped for, or want.

I also have several red blotches, which are taking (at least) a few days to fade.  It's not a lovely look.

Am I allergic to the product?  I don't think so.  On the other hand, there were unpleasant sensitizing effects each time I tried the product, and they did not mitigate at all the next time I used the product.  I may try again when my skin is completely back to normal--and the pollen count is very low.

But I may well not.  For me, this has proved to be more of a skin irritant than a skin improvement.",1466208000,2016-06-18

4.0,"Hair type: below shoulder length, baby fine, hi-lighted

I wasn't sure what to think about this product when I first poured some onto my palms---it is an ""oily-feeling"" treatment, and I feared it would make my baby fine hair look greasy. In fact, I knew I'd put too much onto my hands, and wiped some of it away, so a little will go a long way (this product will last me forever!). I then worked the infusion from about ear-length down to the ends into my just-washed hair--I did not put any at the roots. Then I blow-dried with a round brush. At first, I didn't think it did much, but when I walked out of the bathroom, my guy said, ""Wow! Your hair looks beautiful! What did you do differently?"" He ran his fingers through it, ""it's soft and silky - sexy!""

I marched back into the bathroom and looked at my hair - yup, smooth, shiny, and silky all right. And after sleeping on it all night - even tossing and turning -- I woke to smooth silky hair! Okay, so, I'm sold!

If you have baby fine hair as I do, don't over-do it -- just use maybe a dime-sized at most, and don't apply it to the roots - also, work it in really well into wet/damp hair, and then blow dry with a round brush--though I want to try it without blow drying to see what it will do. I also noticed it made my hi-lights look better - I think it must be the ""smoothing"" effects that allowed my hi-lights to shine, but whatever the case, this product works for me.

Amazing product!",1431043200,2015-05-08

5.0,"I am a makeup artist.  I have tried a lot of different makeup from drugstore to professional brands.  One of the things that is very handy to have is something for the body if you need to cover a scar, discoloration, or a tattoo.  Although I have some makeup that will do a good job, often it takes some time for application.  What I was looking for was something quick and easy in a pinch to use on those days when a full careful application is just not possible due to time constraints.

WHAT IS THIS FOUNDATION STICK LIKE?
Like the old Bonnie Bell Lip Smackers in the large tube, this body foundation is a very thick stick that comes in a tube with a cap on it.  The foundation that I am reviewing is color 50C also called Honey.  The foundation itself is similar to MAC 37C but a little bit pinker.  In the summer this color is very close to my tanned skin.  Since this is a body cover up stick, it is perfect.

HOW TO APPLY
I find that this is best applied over moisturized skin.  It blends into the skin best when it has been moisturized and prepared for the makeup.  However, quick applications sometimes do not allow for pampering, so I also tested this on skin in emergency situations.  In both situations I applied directly to the skin and then blended the edges.  I put powder on top to set the makeup and then brushed off the powder.  When I say powder, I mean powder that is the same color as my skin.  I have also used a translucent powder which does not show up at all.

HOW DOES THIS MAKEUP PERFORM?
On surfaces that are uneven such as a scab, scar, or other skin problem, this takes some layers to cover. You will still see the uneven nature of the skin, but it blends it nicely into the skin so it is not as obvious anymore.  As far as full coverage, if I apply very thickly, it will eventually start to come off due to the nature of the thick application.  With a few thin layers built up, it works better.

With dark discoloration, bruising, or tattoos I have to say that this does not cover completely.  Having said that, I find that using a corrector on the skin first which is the opposite in tone to the discoloration, I am able to tone down the discoloration nicely.  Then when I put this foundation on top carefully with fingers or a damp sponge, it does cover a LOT better.

For instance, if the large spot is red in nature, then a green corrector lightly applied on top will neutralize that discoloration so that when you put the foundation stick over that, it will be a little easier to cover.

OTHER CORRECTOR COLORS YOU MIGHT NEED
 If you have a deep red or purple area, for instance, try using a yellow corrector.  For grey or brownish areas a pink corrector is usually best. For bluish areas you are covering up, a soft orange neutral corrector is usually helpful.

HOW DOES THIS WEAR?
In cooler weather, it wears nicely.  There are not any problems with it coming off or melting off as a really hot sweaty day might offer.  If it rubs on clothing or something, it will wear off some and has to be reapplied.  The stick is easy to carry, however, so that is not a huge problem.

In hot humid sticky weather, this is a little harder to keep in place, but it still works nicely.  I just try to keep the stick handy if possible, but not in the car, as it will melt and cause problems with the foundation stick.

I also found that this stick was not dry or cake-like.  It does sometimes have to be reapplied so be prepared to carry it with you in very important situation if at all possible.

THE BOTTOM LINE
Convenient, portable, and easy to use, this body foundation stick does a decent job of covering body imperfections quickly and especially when a careful pampered application is just not possible.  It covers most things well and very dark things with a bit of corrector first.  Wear depends on the day.  Sometimes I get a full day, sometimes I need reapplication.

MY RATING
All in all, this is a decent foundation to have handy.  I would suggest if you really like having this on hand that you purchase two colors- one that blends with your summer skin and one for winter which is usually a different tone.",1501200000,2017-07-28

One thing to remember is that vitamin c will brighten the skin, so if you are already pretty fair, you might want to blend it with another product.

The first thing that I did was smell the product to see if it smelled ""manly"". It doesn't. It smells amazing. It has a sweet almond smell that is addicting. The scent could definitely work for either sex. The scrub is in a form that spreads easily on your face, exfoliates and washes away easily. This makes the whole face washing experience quick and easy.

I love the grittiness of the facial scrub. It does an excellent job of both cleaning and exfoliating my face. My oily skin feels clean afterwards and it doesn't dry it out like some scrubs do. I am really loving this facial scrub and I have pretty much stolen it from my Husband. It has replaced my St. Ives Apricot Scrub for the moment. I do not know if I will purchase it again because of the price. However, given the choice between the two I would use this Baxter scrub. I like the scent and feel better.

It applied very nicely, a cream thickness to it, not watery or runny. It absorbs well and hydrates my skin nicely. It's pricey for a lotion, but good for what you get. I'm in the sun a lot and this makes a difference in the appearance of my skin, which is well hydrated skin.

A little does go a long way and while I like it a lot, I pay the same for a Creighton coconut and Cocoa butter based lotion that is 33oz for the same money. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly good but maybe I'm not firmly enough in the target market for this product.",1458518400,2016-03-21

Elemis Serum has a rather strong, lingering, perfume scent.  It isn't a bad scent, it is just stronger and more noticeable than I am used to with face products.  The serum is quite thick and oily feeling.  Applying it feels like rubbing coconut oil on my skin.  I have been using this at night, after washing my face, and then following it with my usual moisturizer as the directions indicate.  As oily as the serum feels, I have to say I don't wake up in the morning with a greasy face.  My skin has not broken out or seemed irritated by this product.

5.0,"I am typically lazy when it comes to removing my make-up and I prefer pre-moistened cloths. I have tried other Vichy products in the past and loved them, so I figured that I would give this a try anyhow. My eyes are normally irritated after removing my eye makeup (which consists of mascara, eyeshadow primer, eyeshadow in different layered colors and eyeliner). I applied the Vichy to a cotton pad and removed my eye makeup after a long day of class. The eye makeup came off pretty easily. It did leave my eyes feeling soft (but not gross like some makeup remover) and didn't irritate them. I even used some of this formula along my lower lash-line trying to really get my eyes clean. I don't know that it necessarily ""soothed"" my eyes. However, it didn't irritate them. That is a plus for me.

I also really like the scent. It is refreshing and not over the top. The only downside for me is the price. I can buy many other makeup removers that work for much less than the current price of $17 a bottle. I will enjoy using this makeup remover while it lasts (which will actually be awhile).

If you are looking for a smoky look, you must work quickly because it resists smudging almost immediately. I wasn't much impressed by their stay fresh twist on cap. I haven't encountered any problems with pencil liners drying out and the pencil was not notably soft or creamy.

That being said, I liked the color and was impressed by its staying power. It is a good choice for hot or busy days when reapplication is a challenge.",1403654400,2014-06-25
3.0,"I'm mid-30's with combo, sometimes very dry skin. I don't wear a lot of makeup, usually just mascara and BB cream. There are a lot of things I like about this BB cream. I love that it has sunscreen. Has a light feeling but also feels moisturizing. It goes on smoothly and melts into skin. Nice texture. Looks beautiful, though this seems light dependent. In certain harsh sunlight it seemed to exacerbate fine lines because of the mica in it. I also didn't like the fragrance which seemed floral to me. Lastly, I think this light color would be best in the dead of winter, for me it was a bit too light with the last hints of tan from summer time. Personally I prefer a mica free(for me this means shiny-free) BB cream but some might really like that quality. I've actually just started using it more as a highlighter with my regular BB cream underneath and that's working well.",1445558400,2015-10-23

It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave an oily residue - very clean application.  It seems to have a slight effect on acne.  I have a chronic blemish that comes up on the side of my nose where my glasses rest, and after using this for a few days that has reduced considerably (its not gone, but the reduction is heartening!)

The cream is not sticky like a lip balm, it is more like a lip moisturizer that you use on lips and surrounding area.  I did see an improvement in the fine lines around my mouth.  I really could not discern any fragrance.

I would give it five stars except I had a slight allergic reaction to it--which is not uncommon for me.  I have very sensitive skin, and I have had allergies to lipsticks as well.

5.0,"This is not only a great setting mist, it's also an awesome sunscreen.  I use it because the Florida sun is relentless and I need a good sunscreen every day. I hate the greasiness of most high SPF lotions and they don't work well under makeup when you have oily skin like I do.  So this spray SPF 50 mist is the perfect solution.  I have worn it when riding motorcycles and it's worked like a charm.  I've also used it during outdoor sporting events and I've never had even a hint of sunburn.  I use it daily to set my makeup and it's been a true champ at keeping my face fresh even as the heat and humidity climb.  I have used it for about 6 months in all kinds of situations and it's always worked perfectly.  When riding the bike, I keep it in my backpack and reapply every few hours.  I do the same thing at any outdoor event.  However, just one spritz is all I need for any regular day.  It can sting a little when it first goes on, which is not uncomfortable, so be sure to keep your eyes closed but it dries almost instantly.  It's far superior to any sunscreen lotion, especially if you have oily or combination skin.  I highly recommend it for all skin types and I have repeatedly purchased the large bottle at Sephora.  There's simply nothing better than this two in one product.",1459555200,2016-04-02

The color I received is a light rosey coral.  It's actually very close to my own lip color so it goes on lighter than in the photo.  Why I gave it 4 stars is that it goes on so light and smoothly and my lip sort of sighed.  They actually feel less dry after using this lipstick.

Luscious feeling. Easy glide on, I experienced no feathering and I used no lip liner.  This is the only lipstick I've tried that leaves my lips feeling moister afterwards.  I didn't notice any plumping.",1469059200,2016-07-21

I bought it. I tried it. I'm sold! It's not just hype. This mask really hydrates my superdry hair and leaves it silky, manageable, supersoft, and easier to style.

And, oh, the scent. I'm gonna get the shampoo and regular conditioner. Today I bought the oil, but I haven't used it yet.

The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

3.0,"After using this pencil a while, I've decided to remove two stars. That's because I cannot replicate it's original fine point. The sharpener that came with it does a poor job -- the usual breaking of the ""lead"" in this pencil, which results in a dollar's worth of loss each time.

Perhaps better attention should have been paid to the selection of wood or better quality control in actually testing the product on the sharpener attached.  It seems that the original manufacturing process produces a point that might not be available to the average consumer. Disappointed!

---------

I must admit, when I first selected this as a Vine product I thought to myself, ""Who would pay $20 for an eyebrow pencil?""  Now I'm wondering if I should stock up.

How does this compare to other high-end pencils? I cannot say; I have little patience in navigating the very expensive department store brands.  I can favorably compare this Vincent Longo pencil, however, to the more expensive drug-store options from L'Oreal and Revlon: They are generally half the price but also half the length (or less) and half the quality.

Here are the things I like about this pencil:

1. The color is ""blonde.""  Even though my hair is mid-to-dark brown, I learned long ago to use an eyebrow shade much lighter than my hair; ""blonde"" is usually best. (A small quibble: I would have preferred an even lighter blonde, but that's a personal preference.)

2. The point is very fine (yet not vulnerable to breaking, as with the drugstore versions). This means you truly can sketch the small lines that emulate eyebrow hairs instead of drawing on a big blob of color.

3. The compound's consistency  means it has staying power. No running or ""migrating.""  It also adds a little body so that you when brush the brow, everything stays where it's supposed to.

4. The sharpener is the perfect fit for this tiny point.",1394064000,2014-03-06

I tried this Bliss product all this weekend. Wow! Not only was it soothing and hydrating, but it made my skin radiant (probably as a result of the retinoid/Bliss combo). I like the light but unisex scent, the generous amount in the jar (I don't feel the tiniest bit guilty reapplying this throughout the day), and the non-greasy look. (And, don't hesitate to use it on your neck and on the back of your hands ... two very neglected areas).

5.0,"I have used concealers for years as I have always had dark circles under my eyes and red discoloration on one side of my nose due to broken capillaries.  I have always used my finger to put concealer on and its been less than optimum for me as it results in uneven coverage.

The Scott-Vincent Borba concealer brush allows me to apply my concealer with a level of detail and consistency I have never been able to achieve before.  To be honest, I had never even considered the possibility of bacterial contamination from putting my hands in my concealer product, but that makes sense, too.

The tool fits well in my hand and is soft on my face, so there is no pulling on the tender skin under my eyes.  I can get the product into the area between my eyes and nose where previously I had problems with too much or too little product and having to dab at it with tissues to try to get it right.

The only thing that is a consideration with this tool is the cost.  For me, as I use concealer all the time, I would spend the money to get a great tool.  If you don't use it all the time, it may seem to be too much to spend.  That is a personal decision.  I can say that it is an excellent product and one that I am happy to use.",1431561600,2015-05-14

It has the consistency of a masque, a quality I really love because it makes the application quite easy. This is a great face treatment for those with sensitive skin. It seems as though a lot of cleansers use menthol or some agent that makes the product 'tingle' to let users know that it's working, but let's be real for us people with sensitive skin: tingle usually means burn like crazy!  Immediately after using, my face felt squeaky clean! My skin hasn't felt so clean after using a cleanser in a very long time.

I brushed around my eyes before applying make-up to exfoliate. Although it doesn't seem like it's doing much, the bristles are stiff enough to exfoliate the top layer of the delicate eye skin.

When applying the base make-up I rotated the brush in a circular motion, which leaves the skin looking very smooth. After brushing off the make-up onto a paper towel, I swirled the brush into powder blusher and brushed from the apples of my cheeks upward toward the hair line. It gives just a hint of color, which is how I like to wear my make-up.

- Covers smooth and even
- Lasts the day

5.0,"When I read that this smooth liquid foundation helps cover problem areas such as Rosacea, which gives me a red nose, I was excited to try it. The squeeze container helps the foundation to distribute easily, but there is still the potential to over-squeeze. The foundation applies easily and blends well. I'm impressed as it seems to do the job, which is to hide my reddish nose. That said, my associated white spots could still use some extra shading.

Dermablend suggests setting the foundation station with their powder, which might help any transference to things like my phone, but I haven't had any other issues with the foundation coming off or smearing, even when sweating.

4.0,"I have had a Clarisonic Mia 1 for year and really like it. This brush comes with 3 speeds which meant less to me than I thought it would. Flower graphics are cheerful. This cleans well at any of the speeds. I found the ""time to move on"" beeps annoying. Overall, functional for me.

I don't really like the charging stand. You need to snake the charging element through the stand and force the cord through a channel at the bottom. I've owned this less than a day and already the cord is fraying from the too tight channel. The stand is also a bit wobbly. I had to buy a tap/plug for this since it only comes with a USB end for charging. I think that is annoying.

Overall it works fine, it would be 5 stars except for my misgivings about the charge cord and stand.",1489190400,2017-03-11
5.0,"FInally, a Shellac color that combines the perfect amount of subtle, neutral, pale pink color with a fine (as opposed to coarse) shimmer.  CND Shellac's Romantique has been my go-to color for over a year now:  two coats of that, plus one coat of Shellac Zillionaire, but with the new Shellac Grapefruit Sparkle, I will be able to use two or three coats of it and skip the Zillionaire.  Side-by-side, Grapefruit Sparkle has a bit more color density, is a wee bit pinker than Romantique, which make it perfect.  I find if I use a pale neutral, I can get my DIY manicure to last 21-22 days.  More of the natural nail shows as it grows out if you use darker shades, but with pale colors like Grapefruit Sparkle, no one can really tell you've had your polish on for 3 weeks.",1362268800,2013-03-03

4.0,"So basically I'm not a super duper girlie girl.  I'm fine with the basic skin products you find at your local drug store.  Still, when this popped up in Vine, I figured I'd give it a shot - it seemed to be bragging about being organic and I frankly wanted to know if that really  makes this little container worth about six times as much as the big bottle of what I'd usually buy at said local drug store.

First off, I'm kind of confused about what can and cannot be labeled organic but they did put that label on most most of their ingredients.  Organic or not, none of their ingredients seem too offensive (unless, of course, you're allergic to them).

There is a slight scent but it's not very offensive, which is good as my body really really really dislikes most scents.  I tend to get migraines or just sick to my stomach if there is a chemical scent or even a natural scent that is too strong.  This didn't bug me.

As for how it works - I have pretty dry skin.  It  absorbs anything with moisture then wants more more more.  This kind of just sat on top for awhile before finally get all sucked up.  It doesn't take very much - the old a little goes a long way.  My skin does feel fairly decent after using it but I'm not sure it's any better than the cheaper alternatives I have available to me.  I'll use up what I have but probably wouldn't buy it again - only because I'm a cheapskate and the cheaper stuff doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin.  If I didn't have alternatives that already worked for me, I'd probably go ahead and use this - very sparingly - I said I'm a cheapskate.",1414886400,2014-11-02
3.0,"This is the second BB creme I have tried.  I like the idea around these cremes, coverage with spf properties along with some skin brighteners.

The Vichy creme goes on very smoothly and importantly does not burn my sensitive skin at all.  The color (light) will work for many light skin tones from porcelain  to a neutral fair tone.  My skin has some cool undertones and it blended well.  This is moisturizing.  My face felt hydrated and soft.  These are the best features along with the spf.

What I did not like was hiw thus sat in my pores.  This did not minimize them and it sat in fine lines too, seeming to accentuate them.  This overs minimal coverage so I had to use a concealer for some uneven tones in my skin.

5.0,"This is an excellent non-greasy moisturizer for sensitive skin. It really does everything it says it will, and I did not expect any less. This is a great brand in general and all of their products so far have been excellent quality and very effective. We've been buying many Jack Black products for about 7-8 years now and never had a product not work well, never any complaints.

Sometimes with dry, sensitive skin, you get small little patches of dry skin on your face. Some moisturizers turn those dry patches into red patches, because it irritates those areas, especially if the moisturizer is too greasy. Sensitive skin tends to not like anything that leaves a residue or greasy feel. This cream hydrates those areas, and the rest of your face without irritating at all. It is soothing because it eliminates the tightness, as well. It makes your skin feel good and look good. As the weather is getting colder and drier now, the redness and dryness around the creases of the nostrils, outward onto the cheeks, becomes so apparent. This cream helps with that redness too. I don't know how else to describe it other than very soothing. The product name says ""calming"" and that does seem very fitting as well, as it calms down the redness and irritations. There's no itching or burning like there was with other moisturizers.

You don't need to use a lot, so this tube will last quite a while.",1414022400,2014-10-23
4.0,"Back in the 80's, I had a similiar motorized skin brush. It was great while it lasted. Now that  I am middle aged with sensitive, oily, perimenopausal with occasional acne skin I thought I should try one again. Would this really help my skin look better, I wondered?.

The box arrived very quickly. This unit has a magnetic charging station with usb and an electric adapter as well, which is nice  It comes with a face brush, body brush, cleansing lotion and a polishing lotion. Charging it was easy, the instructions say to let it charge for a full 24 hours.
I've used the pre-programmed facial and body cleaning cycles. The face brush is very soft, I wasn't sure it would DO anything when I first used it but I was proven wrong. I wish the face program was shorter for the forehead and longer on the cheeks, but that's a personal preference. My skin does look better after just a week of using it. The clogged pores on my nose are much clearer and smaller and my skin looks a bit healthier.

The body brush is ok but I'm not overly excited about it. I wish it were larger and had a bit more power to it. I had a bit of trouble getting the heads off while in the shower, but I supposed they need to be that tight so water doesn't get to the interior. The cleansing/polishing lotions that come with it are really great. My skin is super sensitive and these didn't dry me out or make me red. I would buy them on their own if available.

Overall, I'd recommend this as an excellent skin care tool!",1485388800,2017-01-26

5.0,"I'm always looking for new, high-SPF tinted moisturizers, and I think I've found my new favorite!

The texture is a little unusual - it comes out thick, with an almost clay-like texture. I was skeptical at first. However, it applies super easily and I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. It looked clear, smooth, and even (the cream immediately took away all of my redness). I was glowing. It gives a texture that is somewhere between matte and dewy - I didn't have the powdered look of matte, but I didn't have the ""was she sweating?"" look that dewy sometimes gives me. And it held through the work day! Usual caveats apply about how the SPF would wear off during the day, etc, but I work in an office so I'm more concerned about my bright commute to work when it comes to SPF than I am about the harsh lights in my office (where I want to look good more than to protect).",1460505600,2016-04-13
3.0,"My hair is rather thick, wavy (frizzy) and cut into a chin length bob.  I had it red, but have been highlighting and stripping it back to blond..  This product didn't work for me the way I'd hoped, BUT, I can see how my negatives might be a good thing for other hair types.

First of all, it made my hair feel crackly and not soft.  My hair is already thick and unruly so this was not a plus.  For people with fine hair, this may be great.

Secondly, I had trouble getting my hair to curl.  I just didn't like the way it behaved with the InStyler that I use.  It felt like it would be easier to straighten my hair with this product instead of curling it.

Lastly, I didn't notice any difference in brassiness control.  Maybe my hair is still too dark to notice much, and maybe it is cumulative.

What I did like -

The container. Dispensing is easily controlled and does not continue to bubble out like some mousses I've used.
The scent.  Not overwhelming, just nice and clean.
The texture of the mousse.  It was easy to distribute through my hair.

CONS
1) Once on my skin, the lotion felt oily and dry.  It stayed that way until removed with soap and water.(I have sensitive, *dry* skin, and it made my face feel oily to the touch.)

4.0,"Although I'm not sure whether this cream has had any effect on wrinkles, it is definitely highly moisturizing.  To my eye, after using this for several weeks, a scar that I have on the side of my neck appears lighter and less noticeable - perhaps the effects of the niacin/vitamin B, or perhaps just from being moisturized daily.  In any case, it's an improvement.

I'm glad that I read the other reviews before I began to use this, because it did cause a reddening appearance and a slight burning feeling when I tested it out the first time.  I used my wrist as a test spot, and the redness went away after a few minutes, so I went ahead and tried it on my neck.  It did get a little red and warm feeling for a bit, but this decreased to the point where it is unnoticeable after 2 weeks.  I absolutely think that they should put this as a warning on the side of the jar.

The cream itself, outside of the health effects, is nice to use, although not my favorite.  It seems that some people can smell a weird or chemically smell from it, and some can't or enjoy the smell.  I fall into the first category.  The smell, to me, seems like compost or soured greens.  I'm not a big fan.  The feel of the cream is cushiony but I find it slightly greasy compared to some of my other creams.  On the other hand, unlike some of the other creams I've used, it has NOT caused acne on my neck.

Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.

4.0,"From the female of the family. This product gives you Kinetin, Zeatin, and Eye-Pro 3x, to reduce the appearance of ""aging skin"" around your eyes. All in all, there are about 30 ingredients in the cream, and many of them are desirable natural products. You need to look at the product and description carefully. This does nothing to moisturize your skin, or get rid of wrinkles. What it does is this: ""Creates optical diffusion, blurring the appearance of fine lines and shadows."" In other words, it is makeup.

I apply a moisturizer to my entire face. I don't use makeup over my entire face -- just a tinted see-through foundation. Once moisturized, I use a little of this on a fingertip and apply a very thin layer under my eyes. It gets rid of any dark shadows and just lightens up the area. You don't want to use too much, or it will dry out and have the opposite effect. If you use it alone, it may dry and give a wrinkled look -- one point off for the fact I have to use a moisturizer beneath it.

Overall, I like this lightening effect and find it makes me look younger. However, I find the price of $95 for half an oz. to be high. I think you can find similar product for less, that work just as well.

So she told me about it and it is now the only shampoo I will use from now on.  And what is great about the product is I only have to use a dime size of the shampoo to do the job.  Whereas with the other shampoos I have used on my down to my bra hooks length hair I had to use a quarter or more size of shampoo.  It IS costly, but well worth it.",1384300800,2013-11-13
2.0,Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!,1377388800,2013-08-25

3.0,"Zinc oxide based sunscreens are the best that you can use, but normally they come out looking and feeling like diaper cream.  This one is much lighter and actually blends in well.  Also, it has a cleaner, less offensive fragrance than most zinc oxide sunscreens.  Unfortunately, I do not think I would buy it again.  Obagi is a very high end company, but this has an extremely high price point.  I am very much a get-what-you-pay-for kind of person, but I would expect more for this price.  I have been using Cotz for some time and it is in a similar line.  But the price is substantially lower and it does not have all of the dangerous chemicals that are in this sunscreen.  If you read the ingredients it is full of parabens.  I feel like if they are going to go to the trouble of making a zinc oxide sunscreen (which is usually to avoid the chemicals) then they need to leave out the parabens.  Some people are not bothered by parabens.  If that is you, then I would give it 4 stars.  For me, however, they lose a star for price and one for ingredients.",1485734400,2017-01-30
4.0,"I like this Thermal styling brush, but it doesn't get as hot as my straightener. Even when I put it on the highest setting, it still seemed like it wasn't hot enough to do my hair right.

It's quick and easy to use, but I was looking for more of a smooth finish to the bottom of my hair.

It curls my hair great, but I was looking for more of a salon look, and I didn't get that with my hair. I have thin frizzy hair, so I wanted to straighten it and curl the bottom.

5.0,"Cutting fingernails is always an annoying task.  The cheap little cutters are uncomfortable to use, require a lot of pressure to make their dull ""blades"" cut, and shoot the fingernail tips across the room.  Then the little scavenger hunt begins, as I search the room to try and collect the wayward tips.

I've tried more expensive ones, from better brands like Tweezerman (they do make great tweezers), but the only thing I seem to get for the extra cash is a larger size.  They're still dull, they still shoot the tips across the room, but at least they are bigger.

So, I took a risk and tried this one, not so much because of the name, but I liked that it won a design award, had a cool look, and (my reasoning went) even if it turned out to be no better, at least it looks really good.

Imagine my surprise when this little beauty arrived.  It has a great bead-blasted matte finish that looks like titanium (it is actually stainless steel, according to the packaging).  The little instruction book was tiny and impossible to follow, but who needs instructions to figure out a nail clipper, right?

Well, after thinking it wasn't working (the blades wouldn't quite touch when I squeezed), I finally figured out that the handle has to be raised and then pulled out and up, to settle in a groove on the lever (this will make more sense when you can play with one yourself).  That allows more leverage, and makes the blades close all the way.  So, if you get one and it doesn't seem to work, play with it a bit longer and you'll figure out the lever trick.

The blades are incredibly sharp.  I remember when I got my first set of ""real"" kitchen knives from Henckel after using the cheap kind for years.  The new knives were so sharp it took me a while before I wasn't accidentally cutting myself here and there.  I just wasn't used to having to be careful with them.  This clipper is *that* sharp.

And the real benefit?  No more tips shot across the room!  Turns out that was happening because the dull blades of standard clippers pinch the tip off instead of cutting, and that makes them fly off.  With this one, they just fall right off with no force behind them.  It is great, and makes me look forward to the task.

They are a bit on the narrow side, so it will take multiple clips per nail to do the job.  I don't mind this because I like to have more control over the curve, but it is something to be aware of, particularly if you've been using the more expensive, larger styles.

Also, the leather pouch that it comes with is incredibly stiff, and it is a real effort to jam the clipper into it.  It does loosen up a bit with use (I've had mine about six months now), but the quality of the pouch is not as high as the clipper.

What's that Maglite tagline?  A work of art that works?  That's what this is!  Attractive enough to be in the museum of modern art, and effective enough to make you round up your collection of older clippers and toss them in the trash.  The price is a lot if you aren't sure it works, but it does.  Really, it is worth twice the cost, and looks the part.

You'll enjoy this one!

4.0,"This review is for the ""Yogi Flow"" scent, although some of my comments are about the container and will apply to any of the scents.

I like the scent of this. It's lightly floral. I am not noticing the ""almond"" from the description much (almond is one of my favorite scents, too). I feel that this gets me clean without irritating my skin and it washes off without leaving residue. I don't really think the scent sticks around. At any rate, as a shower gel, it's decent and it has really nice lather.

What I don't care for as much is the can. The dispenser nozzle is pointed in a way that you might not expect, and it led to me wasting a whole bunch of shower gel when it sprayed all over the shower curtain liner instead of onto my pouf sponge. In general, I found that I had to dispense a lot of this relative to what I would use from a more traditional bottle. This meant that I used the product up super fast. Since it is not the cheapest shower gel around, that is something to keep in mind. (Also, it probably can't double as bubble bath like most shower gels/body washes normally can.) I really just don't feel like I got as many uses out of this as I have with some other shower gels I've used lately, despite having a similar package size. The can was sort of conducive to product waste.

It's a good shower gel but I don't like the dispenser. If I could get this in a (recyclable, of course) plastic bottle, I think I'd be able to give a little higher rating. Also, please note there may be shipping restrictions because this comes in a pressurized can. 3.5 stars.",1429228800,2015-04-17

3.0,"When I read that this bronzer gave a ""natural.....glow"", I did not expect it to have bright sparkles in it.  I'm not of an age to do sparkly makeup.  And actually, even when I was at that age, I didn't go in for sparkles.  Yes, I did look at the close up picture of the make up on this product page, but I just did not make the connection.  The inclusion of tiny sparkles in this bronzer is a disappointment to me.  Neither the words ""natural, radiant, sun-kissed glow"", not the pictures, conveyed to me that it had so much sparkle.

The color is fairly well represented on this product page.  It may be a touch lighter than I expected, but barely.

It is easily picked up by my brush, and it applies effortlessly and smoothly.

It's started to curl in the past four years naturally.  It frizzes in humid weather and in cold weather. It's past my shoulders.  Again it's ugly.

I use copious amounts of Sebastian's Potion 9 for several years.  It works but I saw this and decided to give it a try.  For a week I used it daily.  Wow is right.  It ranks right up there with the Potion 9.  You use it sparingly and I worked it into towel dried hair to tame that cowlick and I kid you not, it tamed it.  I didn't have use a blow dryer to wrestle it down.  I combed it through and the WOW flattened it and actually made it look natural.  There's a small smell--not unpleasant but it goes away.

I can't decide if I'll stay with Potion 9 or completely switch over to Wow.  I'll be trying the shampoo next.",1460160000,2016-04-09

My face gets greasy film on it whenever I use any moisturizer that contains a sun screen. Even if it doesn't start out that way, within a few hours I end up with this dirty greasy film on my skin. No attractive. So I prefer face creams without any sun screen, just like this one.

The glass jar container is attractive and luxurious looking. The face cream itself feels wonderful on my skin. The skin brightening is not something that happens over night. I've been using this for a few weeks and my skin is just starting to show the effects of it.

With that said, this product is an investment. Not at all cheap, you'll need to keep up with it and reorder more when you get to the end of your jar. I do like the way it works on my skin, however I don't find it works any better than my regular go-to face cream, SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Cream. And the SKIN&CO cream is about half as much (still not cheap), however it does not have a skin brightener in it.

For an eau de toilette this is still a very intense scent and should be used with restraint or it can easily become overpowering. I prefer a level of cologne where you just get an intriguing whiff and you want to get closer to smell more of it.

Although I still have wrinkles (close to 70 years with lots of sun exposure over the decades), my skin looks more vibrant and youthful and smoother. The toner is a pleasure to use in every way. I like it better than the MEG 21 Smooth Radiance Face Treatment, although my guess is that they are more effective used together.

My one concern is that my skin has responded with so much youthful exuberance that I've developed a few pimples. Gross. I am now using a little salicylic acid treatment to counteract that unwanted development and it's working well.

4.0,"Loved this when I first started using it, does give a lovely glow to the skin. I have recently stopped using it however because I think it accentuates the lines on my face (in my mid 50's). The colour range is a bit strange, I was using the No. 7 which is a tad too dark (&very yellow) so bought No. 5 which is a tad too light (&more pinky) so ended up mixing the two. I think this would be great on younger skin. I think the problem is with its very thick consistency which I have found makes lines worse.",1419897600,2014-12-30
5.0,"Is is probably the third product I've tried fro La Roche-Posay and I'm impressed with what they produce.  This mascara is a true black.  It goes on easily and dries quickly so it's easy to apply a second coat and you'll most likely want at least two coats because it doesn't go on thick in fact that's probably what helps prevent clumping because this is the first mascara I've used where there's zero clumping.  It also wipes off cleanly if some goes astray which I do more than a little.  When applying my first coat I got a smudge in the corner of my eye.  Because this is such an often occurrence I dint even attempt to get it off immediately, I waited until I'd applied it to both eyes and then used a cotton ball to take it off and to my surprise it disappeared completely on my first try!  It stays on all day without any under eye flaking and washes completely off with soap and water.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive but over all the added price is probably warranted.",1488931200,2017-03-08

This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.

4.0,"I would never have thought that I could put white powder on my face and not look like a geisha! I didn't use the enclosed puff. I applied over foundation using a brush. Use a light hand and brush away any white residue that remains. I've also applied it over L'Oreal's Visible Lift Radiance Booster, which I use alone sometimes when I'm just running out to the post office, or trying on clothes at the store and don't want to get makeup on things. The setting powder takes away the shine of the L'Oreal primer.

So, now I'm using green primer (to neutralize redness) and white powder. What next?!? I have very fair skin, so the white setting powder blends well. I don't know how it would work on darker or more olive complexions. I love that the mirror on the compact is large -- you can see your whole face in it.

My skin is normally very dry  ~ this year, after all this crazy cold, it's scaly, itchy, TERRIBLE, and I've tried so many products, soaps, etc...this is the BEST soap I've very used.  I was afraid it would be really oily, but I'm at the point I'm desperate, so I did not really care...I put a hair clip in to keep my hair off skin while I soaped up with this the first time.  To my utter amazement it goes on smooth, slick...and NOT at all greasy or oily, and rinses clean!!  Your skin feels smooth and silky, and with this and moisturizing with coconut oil after my shower, my skin is more hydrated than it's been in MONTHS.  It was getting little bumps on the back of my arms and back, so itchy...it's all gone now!!  My skin is healing!  This has a very light scent, is very non greasy, non oily...I've already put the shower gel in my cart as well.  This is worth the price for certain.

5.0,"So I was a bit skeptical at first. But one night I decided to put some makeup on my hand, I figured if I could get it off my hand with no problem than I could get it off my face with my problem. I was right. The makeup just came off my hand with a few swipes. Just add water.

Update 4/19/15: This past weekend I had a chance to use the makeup eraser again. I put my makeup on Friday evening around 6pm and didn't take it off until 4 am on Saturday. I was exhausted but my makeup melted off with the water and the eraser. My entire routine( makeup removal, face wash, night cream) took less than 5 minutes. Normally I would soak my face in oil to remove the Makeup and then wash it a few times to make sure all the oil and makeup was off. This thing is a life and time saver. Even my waterproof mascara came off. I use an electric skincare brush to wash my face and there was NO makeup on the brush. My skin felt amazing. $20 for a magic cloth to remove makeup...you can't beat that.",1428883200,2015-04-13

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

I washed my hair first and then put it on and let it set about 5 minutes before rinsing. My hair is kind of thick so I think next time I will also use conditioner before I use this and see what happens. I've certainly never used a hair product that cost this much before but if it works, I might buy another bottle anyway.  My hair is so thick that it is hard to tame it sometimes but this did a great job of it and I really like the shine.",1491264000,2017-04-04

At the very least, you'd think they would have made a nice case that it would fit in but it's really just a rough leather sleeve. The clippers are hard to put in the case and it's really not a good fit at all. To add insutl to injury, these clippers are made in China.

3.0,"I ordered this for my 18 year-old daughter who loves makeup. She says the setting powder does it's job by keeping makeup from creasing, especially the under eye concealer. However, it's white and leaves a white cast even after it's baked (with a damp makeup sponge). This would probably show up white on flash photos. (If given the choice, she would have ordered a colored powder and given the product a higher rating because it would have been a good dupe for Laura Mercier powder.) You can reduce this by adding more foundation powder but this just causes you to set your makeup twice. My daughter says the setting spray is just okay. The mist isn't fine enough and leaves big droplets on your face. It also smells a little strange. Overall, she says the products work but aren't good enough to justify the price.",1513987200,2017-12-23

That feeling quickly dissipated when I tried this product. The formula is bizarre. It doesn't blend into your skin, it kind of floats on top. It won't set with powder, and looks super cakey.

My biggest qualm is that the lightest version of this formula is at least two shades too dark for my skin. The color is really muddy and just looks extremely patchy. Be wary of the high reviews of this.

MAKEUP QUALITY
Michelle Phan made her debut on YouTube where she became a sensation with Tween, Teens, and 20 somethings. And okay... with moms like me. I watched the vids with my then-tween/now-teen daughter. They are truly entertaining and educational. I love Michelle's approach to makeup and life; it's just a lot more healthy and upbeat than most of the other media influences that my daughter and her friends run across.

In any case, Michelle caught the eye of a makeup company and they gave her a line. The makeup is okay. About on par with the sort your buy at the grocery story or the drugstore. It is however at a more premium price. And you are paying for the name.

SUMMARY
I think the main problem with this product are the perky colors and the less than optimal pigmentation.  Lots of comments on this.  To which I'd say how pigmented do you want your turquoise eye shadow to be.  These are colors, in my opinion, geared to very young users.  If I saw them on a woman in the workplace I'd expect her to be reliving the 60's.  But that's just me. I have old references ;]

This makeup though is perfect for girls like my daughter who is 15. Teens like her tend to overdo their makeup. The less drastic pigmentation that others are complaining about is exactly what I want my teen using. LESS IS MORE.

So, excellent gift if the price isn't a problem. This collection looks nice and there's a variety of shades to play with. Do get the free compact and do purchase a selection of brushes. The one that came with this is totally pathetic.",1418601600,2014-12-15

3.0,"The particular wipes that I received are indeed scented, and somewhat strongly scented at that. I am not one that is weary about scents, though, so I used up the pack. I am comparing these Mustela wipes to two other wipes I've purchased repeatedly: Pampers Sensitive (I have them on subscribe & save) and Water Wipes.

These are much thinner than Pampers Sensitive wipes, and marginally thinner than Water Wipes. For messy diaper changes, I double up the ""first pass wipe"" when I'm using these and Water Wipes. So they are not ""extra thick"", as mentioned in the description. They do a good job otherwise and are non-irritating to my child's skin. They are not super saturated--actually kind of on the dry side--and thus I use more than I would with my Pampers Sensitive wipes. These are also 8 bucks a pack, which is significantly more expensive than any other wipes I've used. I know Mustela is somewhat of a luxury skincare brand--and I LOVE most of their products (the Stelatopia line has been a lifesaver for my child)--but these wipes are sort of a miss for me. Because of their price-point, and how thin and dry they are compared to Pampers Sensitive wipes, I wouldn't recommend them.",1501459200,2017-07-31

After application, wait a bit and then massage the excess onto your skin. It doesn't say how long to leave it on for. I've left it on my skin in varying times, anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, simply because I had forgotten I had something on my face. The first time I used it was after a late night, when my face wasn't looking its best.  The mask perked my skin up and made it look well-rested and dewy.

1.0,"This Japonesque Kumadori Buffing Brush is a great brush, until you wash it. The brush is a perfect size. The handle is ribbed and comfortable. The bristles are firm, yet very soft. The brush worked well with foundations, bronzers and blushes. The design has a looped end for easy drying after washing it.

The real test of a good quality brush is washing it. After using it for a week with powders, I rinsed it, gently washed it with a drop of mild shampoo, rinsed, towel blotted it, reshaped it and hung it to dry. The next morning, I applied some powder and immediately upon using it, the bristles were falling out all over the place.

I've had cheap brushes where the brush falls apart after a few washings, but this is ridiculous. A brush that cannot survive one gentle wash is a total waste of money. I am surprised that Japonesque would allow a brush this nice to be made this cheap and pass any form of quality control.

It does have a scent which is strong for the first few minutes after applying, but it's not overpowering and quickly fades to a light, clean fragrance.

Smear it all over your face and neck in an upward manner and go to bed. It's as simple as that.

I have tried virtually every skin cream ever made and this Night Cream by Baxter is defintely one of the best.

5.0,"This is one of the best skincare products I've ever tried. In late 2013 I went for a facial. It was a first-ever manual face treatment that impressed me by an immediate effect. I went back a couple of times and at the beginning of 2014 bought all the products that esthetician used on my face.
Four years later this is only the product I swear by. I'm 38 years old and I don't have any smile lines around my eyes. People tell me that it's impossible that I'm that old. My eyes don't have wrinkles!
Since the age of five, I always had under eye bags and circles. I've tried many skin care products, but nothing was making the difference, except this serum (and Chanel Beauty Initiale - discontinued).
My under eye area is not perfect, but I don't have to wear concealer on daily basis and my eye bags are gone.

3.0,"Ingredients in this cream  are mainly dimethicone, stearic acid and water. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients.

3.0,"I wanted to give this a try to see if it would work on my oily skin.....it did not. I'm a guy, i've always had oily skin so i don't have wrinkles just constant oily looking skin. When i'm not able to wash my face, i thought that using this spray would help but again it didn't.

However, It has a very fine mist, its cooling and refreshing. This will be great for the summer when you are at the beach and after. I've used it for a few days now and using it as a toner before bed and also for a quick refresh during my day. I can feel the salt and toner sting for about a minute after using, its less than many other toners i've used.

The sprayer is easy to press and again its a fine mist that coats your face evenly. It does get on your chest area too as the mist is wide. Not sure if it would stain or leave a mark on clothing, haven't worn anything light colored that would show anything.

Fragrance free, its basically salt water so there's really nothing in it other than the 3 ingredients of water salt and sink (not the scientific words but the general plain english). Don't think i'd purchase this in the future as i didn't see the results i hoped for.",1488412800,2017-03-02
4.0,"Overall this is a nice, creamy moisturizer. It does a good job of locking in moisture and is light on the skin. There's a light floral scent that I don't care for as I prefer no scent in moisturizers, but that is a personal preference. There is an ever-so-slight plumpness that this product gives to the skin which visually is nice and youthful, and it seems to last a few hours. I don't know if the anti-fatigue part really does as much as you'd think, but I will say that my under eyes seem a bit less puffy these days but about as dark as usual. I have olive-skin that is pretty thick, so this product might be better for lighter, thinner skin people.",1441497600,2015-09-06

I lather up w/a small amount, rinse fairly quickly and pat dry.  You can really feel the menthol immediately and my face still feels soft after.

4.0,"Being a regular guy, and no expert on face masks, for crying out loud, I can't say much. But I can say this - when I gave it a try it reminded me exactly of rubbing mud on my face at the Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa in Reykjavik, Iceland (look it up). Feeling that more might be said, I turned this over to my wife, and this is what she had to say...

""I have been using beauty products for over 20 years.  I've used almost everything, from inexpensive to very expensive brands.  I hadn't used a mask in a while and jumped at the chance to try this one.  This was BEFORE I realized it was a product for men.  What a disappointment!  Overcoming my disappointment, I decided to try it anyway... and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a nice clay mask.  It dries well and after rinsing my face feels very smooth and clean.  I have sensitive skin and was pleased to note this did not dry it out or cause any kind of adverse reaction.  This product is priced a little less than a similar Clinique product and I would say it's in the same ball park as far as quality.  If you're a man who wants a skin car product, this seems like a good bet.  Or, if you're a woman and don't want to buy your own expensive face masks from Clarins or Estee Lauder, use your husband's.""",1377043200,2013-08-21

3.0,"This is a great under eye concealer for those who are on the lighter end of the skin tone spectrum.  It helps reduce the appearance of dark circles under the eye, and helps improve the texture of the skin.

I have been using this twice a day for two weeks.  My dark circles are purplish in color, and hereditary (thanks, Mom!).  They are not terribly obvious since my glasses hid much of the marks, except with winter pale skin.  And winter is coming.  So, when offered the chance to try this product, I decided to get it.

The cream is a pale, creamy light beige color, and goes on smoothly with the applicator.  After application, you blend it into the skin with the fingertips.  If your skin is darker or particularly pale in tone, it may take a little more blending so the cream is not noticeable.  I have to blend more than my daughter does (she's really pale).  It does cover the circles, but, as others have remarked, it does not fade them or make them go away.  I have noticed an improvement in the texture of the skin under and around my eyes.  It is smoother and less crepey looking.",1446249600,2015-10-31

You do have to be fairly gentle when applying because it can remove your foundation fairly easily. The problem comes in with the ""button"" you have to push. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you get nothing, sometimes you get way too much and other times you get nothing. The make-up itself is great quality but the applicator could use some work.

Wish the applicator issues I'd say the price is too high for the product you get. There are better options on the market at more reasonable prices. Overall, I'd say spend your money on something that has a better applicator and good makeup.",1449878400,2015-12-12
4.0,"Bought this color because I saw it used in a number of different layering images with other colors.  I haven't yet done any layering but this is a nice shimmery pink.

This is a UV cured 'gel' polish.  Done properly, a CND Shellac will last 1-3 weeks.

I have softer flexible nails - My nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer.  Acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic 'off brand' gel polish, they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak so I decided to buy the CND kit & do it myself (also saving me $ in the long run.)  Before Shellac I gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day. What a waste to spend all that time painting and drying for it to peel away the next day.  I type a lot at work as well as boxing and packing stuff so I am tough on my hands.  Shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy WITHOUT any filing.  It lasts me about 7-10 days on dark colors, because I chose to take it off when I can see growth at the cuticle.  On many others, it will easily last 2 + weeks",1345939200,2012-08-26

3.0,"I am used to paying premium prices for premium cosmetics and perfume, if it is worth the cost. While I like the look and feel of this product, I feel it is priced well above what it delivers for the amount you receive.  It made my skin feel smooth and look more uniform, but I would spend my money on POREfessional rather than buy this product. Putting half on one side of my face and half of the VL on the other, POREfessional has better muting qualities and can be worn solo for a more even skin tone without a full face of foundation.  Under BB cream and foundation they were tied as a base layer.

There are a lot of great primers out there and I think it is VITAL that a gal go to the department store or Sephora and try them on in person before purchasing online.  Every formula is different and testing many makes a big difference in finding the perfect one for your skin.  I used to work a cosmetics counter in college and I can recommend updating your whole routine every few years because your skin changes as you age and what worked great for you at 27 may not be the best any more at 33.

Tip: To create a flattering finish on your face after applying all your cosmetics, spray a miro-fine mist of water on your face. You can buy a can of aerosol Evian, or you can get a travel-sized bottle for hairspray and fill it from your Britta or other filtered water.  This makes your face look more youthful by putting a microscopic dew layer on the surface that is present in young skin, in the light your skin and face will look fresher and more natural.",1392681600,2014-02-18
4.0,"The Zwilling J.A. Henckels Stainless Steel Soap works as advertised. The bar comes with minimal instructions, and the English instructions were covered with tape. Luckily the tape did not take off the instructions. I have used a different stainless steel bar before, so I had and idea on how they work. They are not like normal soap. When using this bar, here is my suggestions:

1. To get the smell off, the bar must come in contact with all skin that has the offending smell on it. Under the fingernails? No dice. they will smell. Even with missing the fingernails the smell is hugely diminished.

2. You must use the bar for a minimum of 40 seconds. A quick wipe will not do it. All skin must be scrubbed thoroughly, and the longer you scrub the  more effective it will be.

Compared to the soap shaped stainless steel bar I own, this one has curves. I was concerned about its functionality... until I used it. The curves make it easier to touch all the skin and remove the smell compared to my other one.

4.0,"The pursuit of youth can be very expensive. However, as many people know, skin creams can be a giant ripoff. But, if you find something that truly works, then its worth every penny.

I was excited to try out the TNS serum which uses growth factors to make skin look better. Growth factors have been in the skincare news for awhile based on their potential. They can, supposedly, rejuvenate collagen and elastin (two important things for the skin) at the cellular level.

However, the research isn't conclusive, with some arguing that the growth factors cant even get into the skin to be effective. Theres also been some concern about them creating favorable conditions for skin cancer.

However, most ingredients in skincare have a hard time getting deep into the skin. A good solution to overcome this is micro-needling. If you don't do this already, youll see a huge benefit if you add the practice. Its easy and cheap. Just Google it (or derma rolling).

As for the cancer claims, theres never been any hard evidence or conclusive proof. And, given the overall risk factors many people have for the disease, it would be hard to isolate one factor like this.

After using this cream for several weeks with micro-needling, I definitely notice that my skin looks better. However, I use other items (internally and externally), so its difficult to say this made a huge difference. But, it definitely helped.

Given the high price, Id research it to make sure its right for you. A lot of people swear by it and, if you have the money, its a good bet to make your skin look more youthful. I will also add that while its only an ounce, a little bit really, really goes a long way.",1526947200,2018-05-22

Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

And, although it is labeled ""dark"" I thought the color was more a medium tone.

I did use this product line's application mitt and that helped achieve an even tone, although those users more experienced with self-tanners probably will not need the help.  .",1444003200,2015-10-05

4.0,"Eau de Rochas is a really pleasant, light perfume.  I like that it isn't a heavy, sweet scent but is a fresh, citrus and floral type of perfume.  When I first smelled the perfume, I wasn't really impressed with it.  However, once applied it is much more pleasant and complex.  It isn't overpowering and simply smells clean and fresh.  My husband noticed I was wearing a new perfume and commented that he really liked it too.

The bottle itself is quite pretty and looks quite decorative on my dresser.  This would be a great perfume to buy yourself or to give as a gift.",1423094400,2015-02-05
5.0,"This is a review of Proraso Azur Lime Beard Oil.

I do not have a beard but use this as a shave oil. It works great. If you don't want to use it as a shave oil, it also works well as a pre-shave oil. Either way it has a really nice lime scent that has an old-school kind of scent like a traditional barber shop might leave you with after getting a shave.

I really like this oil. I wash and leave my face wet, then squirt about 10 drops of the oil into my hands and apply it to my face. Immediately begin shaving with my single blade shaver and re-wet my face with water if necessary. That's the secret to using this as a shave oil... don't use more oil, just splash your face with a little more water. It's a close shave and your left with a clean scent and the oil makes your skin smoother and conditioned. Great stuff!",1508976000,2017-10-26

Since the other parts of my skin are dry, I use this product only on my T-zone, and have noticed, after just a few uses, a definite improvement in shine, oil, and what I call ""makeup override"" which is when oil overpowers and makes the makeup on my face disappear in those oily areas.  My nose/forehead still gets oily looking later in the day, but this is a big improvement overall.",1525651200,2018-05-07

5.0,"My husband was quite pleased with this deodorant. He is not someone who works in an office but he does like to wear a dab of fragrance when he goes out, ( he actually found one that doesn't set off my sensitivities,) and always tends to buy deodorant with a scent. I thought this would be nice for him to try.  What he does do for a living is repair machines in a food factory. Even though he is about at retirement age, he has a physically demanding job.

This does not have an overwhelming scent, which I am grateful for, because I am sensitive to fragrance carriers. It is light and pleasant and so far has not given me a blasting headache, so I think I'm safe. Also, the fragrance fades fairly quickly which makes me happy. He enjoys this fragrance and has had no issues with it not being strong enough a deodorant. It works quite well for him, even at work.

I would say that this is a win, win in this house. He was happy as could be at getting a fancy new deodorant, and it doesn't seem to contain the carriers that bother me. Will we purchase this agin? Possibly, as a gift. Perhaps even for my 3 sons.",1445558400,2015-10-23

5.0,"This is an excellent primer. My skin literally glows, I'm so excited that I was able to try. I've been using it for the past two weeks and I can see a major difference between this primer and my previous primer. I put a light coating of primer all over my face before using my foundation. It lasts all day long and doesn't feel greasy. I don't always go all out all over my face, and this works brilliantly to illuminate/highlight too.

Great price for the size of bottle you get, this will last me quite awhile. One pump goes a long way! The pump is a major plus too. I forgot how much I love using a pump- it lets out the right amount, I don't ever accidentally squeeze out too much. No chance of it getting sloppy in my make up bag.

Love this stuff and the natural glow it gives me all day long!!",1414713600,2014-10-31
5.0,"I have thick hair that tends to frizz and pouf up with humidity. I prefer using a cream to sprays when styling but many creams leave a shiny gel like finish which I dislike. I've used this cream on wet and dry hair and it has performed well in both situations.

The Obliphica gives you a gentle hold with a lot of bounce still left. While it has a very light hold, it does make a big difference.  It adds a light sheen to your hair but does not look greasy by the end of the day. It is lightly scented but it is not a strong fragrance and I did not find it bothersome.

The cream is, oddly enough, orange! But it works well at reducing frizz, does not weigh down the hair or leave noticeable residue and so I am quite happy with it.",1490659200,2017-03-28

5.0,"We have three massive make-up cases just for cosplay. And, since I have been the designated make-up person for the last five years ... I can tell you that nothing beats Dermablend. In fact, the entire lower-tier of one of my huge train-cases is just filled with their products. You can buy cheaper but you'll end up layering three times as much product and it will not appear even remotely natural. You simply cannot buy better!

This foundation is perfect since it allows me to easily cover any blemishes my subject may have as well as any birthmarks/beauty marks. And, what I really love is how once I have a clean canvas (one perfectly created by Dermablend), I can layer over regular make-up (or more extreme cosplay make-up) without pilling, rolling, or smudging. I can even do fine line-work ... and the lines stay sharp!! I cannot say any other brand is as forgiving as Dermablend.

Finally, Dermablend lasts until you remove it. We have used this for full days of photo-shoots and panels ... and it just stays put! (It's best to use a make-up removing cloth to gently remove it and then move on to a light cleanser with a Clarisonic. This seems to REALLY do the trick!)

Dermblend is dermatologist recommended and works like a dream. I have never had one subject have any sort of reaction ... ever! That says a lot about these products! Please, do not be put-off by the price ... a little goes a long way for most everyone.

I have used Dermblend for years! It is the best, bar none!",1499558400,2017-07-09

4.0,"What surprised me about this Dermablend product is that it was lighter shade than I expected.  All the other products from Dermablend that I have tried have been surprised me with how dark they were compared to the photo, but this one was a bit lighter.

What I like about this liquid concealer is the matte finish.  It's easy to apply and it's not greasy and it works well with foundation.  It's not heavy like many of Dermablends products that are almost like a paste.  This is like other concealers I have used in the past.  And it should cover most broken veins (you know those tiny red ones) and most freckles.  I tried it on a this yucky age spot on my hand and it couldn't cover it by itself.  It would definitely need foundation.

I was willing to give this liquid concealer a try, and I'm very glad I did! It goes on very lightly, almost like foundation, but it covers better. I was able to use it easily to cover my under-eye circles and a few blemishes elsewhere on my face. It looks natural, and feels light as a feather.

It stayed looking good for nearly 8 hours, but after that did begin to settle into my wrinkles. Still much better than the regular under-eye treatment I had used before that settled into wrinkles right after I'd applied it.",1392681600,2014-02-18

The Vexed Violette is hands-down my favorite shade of purple in the CND line. I describe it as sort of a dignified frosted grape. In certain lights it can look like iron. It has a nice shimmer and it covers well.

If you love purple, you will enjoy this color.  It's not flashy at all. It's a great color for all ages, but it's one of the few purples that older women can wear very well.",1370908800,2013-06-11
2.0,"This is an okay eyeliner. It goes on smooth enough and lasts as long as others I've used. But, it's actually slightly more irritating to my eyes than other eyeliners, so I won't be using it again. I don't see anything to justify paying $17 for it, either, but that's the La Roche Posay brand. It's expensive. I also agree that it's hard to get out of the wrapper, but I think the Amazon Vine label over the pencil's wrapper was the problem. It kept the perforated pull strip from pulling all the way down.",1512777600,2017-12-09
5.0,"I took before and after photos to make sure I was fairly judging my level of youthful radiance before and after using this product. I can say frankly that I look no more radiant, toned, or youthful after using it than I did before.

Never mind. I don't think that's really the point of this product. I think the point is that you can, on a day when you're feeling a bit tired or your skin is a bit dry, spray this lovely stuff on your face and feel much better. The scent is pretty but not lasting, it's certainly hydrating, and your skin will feel softer. I find it refreshing, and that's worth something.

Try it to set your make up in the morning or to revive your energy if you're heading out after work, to keep moisture in after a shower, to refresh yourself when you're out in the summer heat, or to combat that afternoon slump at work. Pass it around at the beach or the pool, and think of it as a pick me up when you're hard at work. It's a much healthier alternative than another cup of coffee or a trip to the vending machines.",1464307200,2016-05-27
2.0,"I had high hopes for this mascara, based on all the glowing reviews.  On the positive side, it absolutely comes off completely with water and a little pressure.  (However, to quibble a bit, it doesn't slide off in ""tubes""--it comes off in stringy clumps, like melted plastic.)

Now on to the negatives.  I have long, thick lashes, and this mascara makes them look very thin.  It adds no volume at all, but rather makes them look spikey.  By the end of the day, my lashes are no longer smooth, but are bent at weird angles.  AND I have flakes under my eyes.  Not only that, but you can't add more mascara once it has dried.  So if you've done your makeup in the am and want to oomph up your mascara before you go out after work, you can't.

I bought a tube of this for my youngest daughter, because she likes waterproof/water resistant mascara, but always struggled with removal.  With Kiss Me she can simply get her mascara off in the shower.  But I don't think it does much as far as adding any lash drama, and she does get some flaking.

All in all, unless ease of removal is your biggest concern, I wouldn't recommend this mascara, especially at the $20+ price.",1270598400,2010-04-07

3.0,"Warning: if you are fair skinned, this may not be the product for you. It applies dark. Even if you closely follow the instructions of using it sparingly and applying it in circular motions ... it is crazy dark (and a touch orange-y but this is probably because I'm nearly translucent, that's how pale I am!)

The great news is that there is no fragrance and no ""weird smell."" And, while it seemed to dry quickly, it still rubbed off on my clothes even after thirty minutes of waiting. So, be careful ... especially with those beautiful white summer skirts.

Now, know that the tube is not as large as I would have imagined. Therefore, it's a bit difficult to justify this exorbitant price (with the color transfer and the dark hue).

I'm going to pass on this. However, I love the idea of people using this product rather than tanning! So, three-stars for it's potential and for its good intentions (of saving people's lives!)",1469404800,2016-07-25

I wash my hands numerous times daily in addition to using hand sanitizer multiple times. Nothing breaks this stuff down. Nails look the same the 21st day as the 1st day.

There are many other products, including the Vitamin C serum from Body Shop, that do the same thing for less than half the price.

Not only does it clean well without overly stripping your skin, but it has a gentle exfoliation with the seaweed bits.  It's soothed my skin and made it glow in a way it hasn't in a while.

The only caveat I have with this product is that you must remove your makeup for it to be at its best.  Most do anyway but sometimes I'm lazy and just do a double cleanse with my previous cleanser.  With this one it's best if you get everything off first but other than that it's really wonderful.

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

I typically go to sleep with wet hair rather than bothering to blow dry it, I'm that lazy with hair styling. I love this iron! I just kept going and did more than usual because it made my hair so smooth and silky. I think the vapor definitely contributed to that. It smells nice and it's very easy to fill. The iron is a pretty color too, it matches my bathroom. The cord is really long for people who have a plug that's not close to where they like to use it.

5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

This is the first time I've used a retinol productis this to be expected?  Even worse, that area looked even drier and tighter as the day went on.

4.0,"This stuff works, but it has a kinda weird hairspray-like quality. I guess that's not surprising, since two of the key ingredients are the same as most hair sprays -- alcohol and PVP. I don't love the smell, and it feels weird when I first spray it on, though it feels natural after it dries. I can't bash the stuff too much, because keeping makeup, especially heavy cover-up, in place is no easy feat. And once the spray is on, it does work pretty well, but I wouldn't try my luck by rubbing my face on anything. One note: The illustration shows the woman spraying with her lips exposed. I hate getting this stuff on my lips, so I always suck my lips between my teeth while I'm applying. You may find that you also can't stand the feel/taste of the product on your lips and if so, you'll probably want to do the same.",1526774400,2018-05-20

3.0,"I'm in my 30's with combination skin. Yes, I do have an expression line or two and I'd love to see it minimized, but the main draw for me was lightening acne scars. The product description here touts that benefit a bit more than the product box, which has one asterisk saying ""may help reduce the appearance of acne scars"" as a footnote to improved skin texture by 3 weeks of use. Since I was hoping to address blotchiness rather than texture issues, the box vs online description was discouraging to me for my particular concern.

After less than a week of use, I saw a definite increase in acne, where my products with retinol and AHA had been keeping it almost entirely cleared up. (I added the serum to my routine and didn't discontinue the others.) After discontinuing use of this serum, my breakout has begun to clear, so I'm attributing the breakout to the serum. This isn't shocking since it does contain oils.

Also, if you're in contact with sensitive nut allergy sufferers, be aware that it does contain macadamia nut oil and do your own research as to the likely safety.

Overall, the breakout issue will probably not apply to many people, but if you're acne prone you may want to look for something else.",1424044800,2015-02-16

4.0,"What an elegantly crafted set! I own a few Henckels knives and scissors and am familiar with the quality of their products. This is definitely in keeping with the precision and design the brand is known for. The scissors are very James Bond, and I hate to admit I had to read the instructions to figure them out. They're pretty clever and streamlined! The file is of excellent quality as well, and the precision with which everything lines up for the nose hair trimmer is pretty impressive. Having said that, the last item pinches a lot. Maybe I haven't figured out the rhythm of how to use it, but the nose hair trimmers really pull on those hairs, so I had to take a star off. It hurts! In good news, they are manual and do not require batteries. The case is leather, very elegant, and has room to add a few other toiletries like Q-tips or little manicure scissors, or something of comparable size.

4.0,"The Vichy Multi-Masking Set comes in an attractive metal box and a bottle of micellar water and 3 small masks.  The micellar water is a light cleanser that doesn't require the use of another cleanser or water to rinse it off.  I usually pat or splash it on, although one can use cotton balls to wipe makeup or grime off.  Of the masks, I like the Double Glow Peel Face Mask best. It is light and has a gel texture when applied.  It's important to follow the directions and not leave the mask on longer than suggested. It exfoliates without leaving my skin feeling stripped.
The Quenching Mineral Face Mask also has a gel texture and feels gentle on the skin.  It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated without any greasiness or excess oil.  The Mineral Pore Purifying Clay Mask left my skin feeling clean and not stripped.",1503619200,2017-08-25

4.0,"This is a wonderful little tool but in my opinion is an outrageous price. It is a great size and feels nice in my hand. I use it to apply my BB cream in the harder to reach areas (around my eyes and nose especially). The applicator sponge is incredibly soft and does not pull on delicate skin. It applies my BB cream smoothly and evenly.

There were no instructions on how to clean the sponge so I just ran it under water and gently squeezed it to remove the excess water and then laid in on a clean towel to air dry. I hope I am doing this correctly because this is something I am hoping to use for a long time but there is no way I would ever pay $40 for it. If you are someone who is willing to pay any amount for an excellent beauty tool then this is for you!",1430179200,2015-04-28
4.0,"I haven't been using this long, but unfortunately I seem to be one of the people who can't really use this without suffering a little.

The good here is that while I can't say that I see any huge difference with my facial contours, I have seen a noticeable difference with my breakouts. This seems to have done a number on my splotches, enough to where I'm pretty impressed. It didn't completely get rid of them, but the spots are lighter than they would on their own. It's enough that if the con of this wasn't so noticeable, I would absolutely be converted.

The con here is that this gave me headaches. This may have been because I was using it at half strength for most of the time, but I've noticed it when I was using it at the lowest setting. The headaches aren't splitting, but they're there and unfortunately my headaches like to linger. I'm trying to debate if I want to continue despite this and limit the usage to only once or twice a week and do only half the routine. I really do like the zit zapping effect. I'm just unfortunately now one of those people who are a little prone to getting lingering headaches, so this likely won't be a problem for heartier people.

Now I'm sure that a big question people will have is ""does it hurt?"" While I could occasionally feel the electricity at half power, it wasn't unpleasant at all and as long as the gel is still dry, is are you won't feel much of anything. It's more of a tingling feeling than anything else when you do feel it, but I imagine that it will be more noticeable at full blast. I've never had it on full blast since I didn't think it was necessary.

So the question here is whether or not it's worth it, as this is an expensive item. Assuming that my results with acne are standard, it's definitely something to look at it you have acne that likes to stick around like I do. I'm not sure how hygienic it is to share these, otherwise I'd suggest using a friend's first to see what you think. As far as wrinkles go, I can't say much on that since mine are fairly small, but I will try to persevere through the headaches with a less frequent schedule and update.",1511222400,2017-11-21
2.0,"Personally, I prefer an antiperspirant in the summers here but do wear just deodorant in winter.  Since this was Vichy 24 hour Deodorant I thought I'd give it a try. I love Vichy products but really did not like this product at all. I did not notice it said it was for ""light activity"" until after I received it. I tried it on a day where all the activity  I did was work on the computer, do laundry and make dinner.  It failed miserably. Within 4 hours I was starting to feel  sweaty (even though this isn't an antiperspirant} and had some odor. Not even CLOSE to the 24hours listed on the labelThe 80 degree humid weather may have had something to do with it, but it shouldn't be so wimpy.

4.0,"This candle smells wonderful and fruity but it's a bit strong for me.  I also do prefer lavender or spice candles and will pick these first when available.  I do have to say though that this has that wonderful aroma of a good wine and would be perfect just to put it in your car beverage holder and let the sun do its wonderful work of melting the candle slowly.  The fragrance does linger quite awhile giving your home a delicious scent even as it lingers longer and longer.

I do love soy candles the best and this does not disappoint.  It burns slowly and evenly without any residual black smoke like the cheaper candles do.  I have sensitive fire alarms and this doesn't bother them at all whereas one or two of the cheaper ones I bought did set them off.  The glass that this candle is in is thick and really would make a wonderful drinking glass were it not for the decoration on the glass itself.  I did cut the wick a bit to burn this as it was a bit long but not overmuch.

Overall, this candle is a wonderful gift for someone who delights in delicious fragrance and loves to burn a quality candle.  The price is a little steep for a 3 inch candle but you get what you pay for and in this case it would be the quality of the candle and the wonderful fragrance.  I would honestly like to try the lavender one and the one that contains verbena and cedar.  Those are more on my scent list.  I can see this easily lasting the sixty hours of burn time due to it's high quality.",1410912000,2014-09-17
4.0,"I am a big fan of skin creams since I always want to look my best. There are thousands of different products on the market ranging from creams to serums to supplements. This product is a serum that claims to illuminates tone, refine pores, and create a more youthful complexion, all in 8 days.

The formula features a behavioral molecule formulation that supposedly boosts the skins natural rejuvenation process. It also has a micro-exfoliator to stimulate skin renewal. These are the claims on the label, but Im not familiar with these particular ingredients.

I tried it for eight days and definitely noticed a difference in how my face looked. It definitely looked more hydrated and youthful. However, its not like it took ten years off or anything. But, I believe it does work to make the face look fresher and rejuvenated.

Its a lighter, creamy texture and doesnt feel greasy. It smells like roses. The smell is not too overpowering, which is good. I don't want anything too smelly, even if it does smell nice (like this).

My main issue with this product (and most higher end serums in general) is the price. Its way too high for an ounce of liquid. I highly doubt the ingredients are that costly.

It seems to moisturize my skin pretty well too. The serum is soft and applies easily. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy. I also have sensitive skin and it did not burn or irritate my face at all.

5.0,"This is like  I just got a haircut and walked out of a shampoo Ad at the same time.
My hair is fluffy and freely moves.
It's so pretty!

You must know, one pump is ALOT!
Please use cautiously and don't apply to roots.

You put one pump in your hands, rub together to warm it up & you'll see what I mean by ALOT.
What looks like a normal amount from a hair product, becomes the river of Nile in your hands.

Start at your ends and work your way up, squeezing into strands, lifting layers of hair.
Really works best by flipping your head & working it through that way,
 so there is just enough to finish a shine on the hair that sees the sun.

I used this on wet and dry hair.
On dry, it didn't JUST calm the frizz but made my hair look like it didn't have frizz.
Although it did nothing impressive for the body but didn't weigh down the style either.

On wet hair, well, that's a different story.
I wash my hair at night to air dry & style in morning.
I woke up to shampoo commercial hair...Full & flowy.
But had to clean up my waves with a flat iron, I use to do a beachy wave.
(Check out the Remington One Pass. Works really quick & Cheap!)

I didn't like that my hair wasn't soft like when I use a leave in or argan oil but,
had that firmness you get from a styling product so, it had to be heat activated to get the run your fingers through hair.
Between you & I, after the style, I had a bit of a big head.
Couldn't walk by a mirror without shaking my hair like show pony.
It's amazing I didn't walk into someone with my momentary narcissism.

The only other thoughts I have to which would answer any questions you may have by reading a review is~
USA made which is a rarity on a luxury product!!
Very light smell, almost none.
I have past the shoulder, color treated, wavy, thinning but a lot of hair.
The bottle is huge in comparison to the amount needed so justifies luxury price.
This is not a styling tool except for heat protection. Doesn't give styled definition without actually styling.
I think best for someone who blow dries.

I will blow out next wash & let you know.

All in all, will hold up against summer humidity.
I got rained on & this was the only product I had on my length..

The scent is somewhat light, however, after several hours I could smell a definite heaver, muskier scent that I didn't particularly like. In bed, that scent seemed to envelope me to the point I wanted to wash it off.

I will say it comes in a cute snakeskin patterned box and is in a heavy and attractive glass bottle with a square top that sits very nicely on a dresser.

For those who prefer a heavier scent, this might be just what you're looking for, but I prefer something not as cloying. So, in conclusion: a great gift for anyone loving sensual fragrances, just wasn't for me.",1517616000,2018-02-03

5.0,"This is a really big bottle.  It has a pump dispenser which works well and which I think is very important for a micellar cleansing product.  The product is like water in that it is just as thin, and the pump helps keep waste down.  One pump will moisten a cotton ball perfectly.  I do like using this product with cotton balls to remove my makeup.  It works great for that.  It takes makeup off without much effort at all.  Waterproof mascara is the most difficult thing to remove, but I just go over my eyelids with each cotton ball as I finish using it, and by the 3rd one it is coming off like a charm.  Depending on how much makeup I wear with my face fully done, it takes 3-4 cotton balls.

It does not strip my skin at all.  After about 2 hours after using this product, my skin will feel a bit oily. This happens whether I rinse my face or not.  I like that, because my skin can get very, very dry in the winter.  I have not experienced any breakouts or skin problems.

It has a pleasant fragrance, though it isn't very strong.

I would recommend it to women with drier skin who need to avoid soaps and harsh cleansers, though this does clean extremely well.  It would also be great for camping trips, hospital stays, or anytime when you might need to clean and freshen your face and don't have easy access to clean or running water.",1508889600,2017-10-25

I tried products all along the continuum that claimed to help with this kind of concern. Nothing seemed to work consistently to help regulate my skin/sun damage concerns.

Both my regular MD and a dermatologist recommended this product as part of how I can keep my skin from chronic peeling and reduce sun spot damage.

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me.

4.0,"This expensive little glass bottle with glass dropper is targeted towards 'mature skin'.  I have been feeling older lately but in all honestly I am 36 years old.  I do not know if I am the target and if I will see any difference.

I use the oil every night right before bed and love how it smells.  It is a light fragrance and feels so smooth.  The directions do not actually state if this should be used in the morning, evening, under make-up etc.  This leave me baffled but I still use it at night because it does leave a sheen and bit of oiliness.  The three recommended drops for the face and neck seems to be just too little to accurately massage as it directs.  I end up using about 5 drops for my whole face and neck.  My skin does feel smooth but I do not know if I see any discernable difference in my nasolabial folds.  This is the area that has begun to bother me as of late.  My skin does feel oilier so I do not see myself using the pro-definition oil and applying moisturizer.  I would apply it by itself.

The product is expensive at 79 dollars for the little bottle but if it proves to work then I wouldn't see any reason not to continue the regimen.  So this is my conondrum... does it really work for me at this age?  Do I have mature skin?  I have been getting more and more brown patches but then again I freckle and am very fair skinned.  Only time will tell if it has helped the my non-existent wrinkles;  I am more concerned with my frown lines, folds and loosening jowels.

I know that winter is usually considered the season for dry skin but I have it year round and applying moisturizer and self-tanner together can affect the results.  The fragrance is nice too, it has a nice floral scent unlike the other ""scented"" self-tanners which smell like the industrial cleaner my city uses to hose down public toilets, I mean light rail elevators (sadly, same thing).

I do wish it had sunscreen, SPF 30 or higher.  And most importantly,  I wish it created a darker tan.  I had to apply it everyday only to achieve a natural looking,  light tan.  If I skipped a day I began to fade to beige overnight.

So, I don't think I would switch to this product.  I might use it during the winter when people don't expect you to have a dark tan anyway or I might use it on the days I don't use my regular Banana Boat tanner.  Too bad, it had some good qualities.",1494460800,2017-05-11

5.0,"I have medium tones of Southeast Asian ethnicity. My skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.

I have never before tried powder foundation  mostly because I didn't think it would stay put or would cover very much. I was pleasantly surprised by the Intense Powder Camo. It comes with a round sponge, which has its own compartment in the bottom of the compact but I just keep it stashed on top of the powder itself. I tried the 35W Toast and the 50W Honey, both of which are in the warm class; however, the Honey was too dark for me. Toast is just right.

According to the instructions, for medium coverage, apply with a powder brush. For full coverage, apply with the sponge. I prefer the sponge because it seems to get more product on my skin. I like to pat all over my face and then blend a little with the sponge. It is buildable; if you aren't satisfied with the coverage of any discoloration or acne or scars, just keep patting more product on until it fully conceals. But do not forget to blend so that the powder looks even. The powder is dense and does stay put, especially if you finish your makeup off with the setting spray.

Although it works well with uneven skin tones, acne and scars, I found that it didn't really fill in large pores nor do a satisfactory job with dark undereye areas. Even with a primer, my large pores still showed up. As for the undereye, I had to use a cream concealer to do the job. For that I recommend using the Dermablend Blurring Mousse Camo.",1499126400,2017-07-04

A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load.

This foundation is buildable, however, I noticed that on my nose and cheek bone areas, it appeared very splotchy and cakey and I could not correct this (the description claims it is not). I love that the spf is so high (30) to help to reduce sun damage. I took one star off because it claims to be ""smudge proof"" and ""transfer resistant"", yet a gentle blow of my nose in a tissue, or a light touch on my face takes this product off (even when using a primer and when set with powder). I added 1 collage picture, untouched, with 2 pictured taken in the same lighting. The first picture is after moisturizing my clean face (zero makeup) and the second picture is after applying the Dermablend foundation (I used a foindation brush). I have to say that for the coverage this foundation offers, it is very light and breathable on your skin. Without too much touching of my face, it did last most of the day. I noticed it wore off of my nose and chin more than anywhere else. I am not sure if this product conceals scars, brusises, birthmarks, burns, etc. as it claims since I don't have those to cover.

WHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE?
A nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.

HOW DOES THIS CLEANSING SOAP PERFORM?
A little goes  along way of this stuff.  It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.

I have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.

In both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.

I have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.

THE WORST PART- ITCHING
The worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.

THE BOTTOM LINE
Great sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.

I have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that.",1473811200,2016-09-14

4.0,"Proraso Shaving Cream has long been available in the ""Green"" scent (menthol & eucalyptus) and has achieved renown as a good basic shaving cream, offering easy lather creation and lots of slickness. The deficits in that formula were few but significant: 1) menthol present (not everyone likes that chilly / irritating feeling), 2) limited post shave care (dry / sensitive skin will feel non-optimal after the shave unless you chuck a balm and / or moisturizer on also), 3) lack of cushion compared to tallow soap. (Kind of apples and oranges as the ProRaso cream is being compared to a soap but as long as you are using a brush, a soap is about as easy to lather as a cream, so why not expand the comparison? Non-brush users should stick with a cream, but they really should try a brush. Odds are you'll like it!)

The ProRaso sensitive formula (aka ProRaso ""White"") has long been a formula in the soap base, but is now offered as a cream, How does it compare to the original Green?

Much better post shave feel - skin is better soothed and moisturized. Many men with normal skin types will not need to use any added skin care products to have non-red adequately hydrated skin. Eggshell face types may still need extra care, especially during cold, dry weather, but even so, White Cream is much more effective than Green.

Lather creation is as easy as the original; a quarter sized dollop will give you a three pass shave, and the lather is easy and quick to work on the face or in a bowl. Slickness is much the same as Green, i.e. very good. Cushion, unfortunately, is also much the same, i.e. not as good as a tallow soap. If you only want a cream (i.e. don't like using a brush) and / or only want vegan products, this is about as good as you can get, but if you want a vegan soap, there are better options (e.g. Wholly Kaw) and if you don't mind using tallow, there are many better options (Tabac, Barrister & Mann, Mickey Lee, Mr. Fine, etc.)

The PR White cream works better than the soap - the soap sometimes dries out on the face during extended duration passes and got flaky. The cream has no such issues, and does everything the soap can plus more, so there is no real reason to stick with PR soap at all anymore, unless you want the extended shelf life. (Most creams start to break down in scent and / or performance after about 12-18 months of use.)

The one issue with the White is that the scent is a bit weak and medicinal. I like it better than Blue, but the Green and Red Proraso creams have better and stronger smells.

TLDR: better than the White Soap. Better than the original Green cream for post shave feel, same in terms of glide, lather creation ease, and (sadly) still has inferior cushion compared to other brands of soap. Still, if you want a cheap cream with good post shave, this is excellent.",1467676800,2016-07-05
3.0,"Be aware this is a new ""hydroquinone-free formula"" and not the regular one from before.  My wife claims she can clearly tell the difference.  She started using t he Obagi products many years ago and I will not complain about the results, as she easily looks 15 years younger than her age.  We had to start mail-ordering the products because Texas put strict standards on products with hydroquinone, thus cutting the number of available suppliers and hiking the amount you pay.  My guess is that Obagi is starting to reformulate some products to avoid the restrictions in Texas and perhaps other states.  She will not be re-ordering this product unless she can get ""the real stuff"".  I can't get much in the way of specifics as to why it performs differently.  She simply claims it leaves her skin flat and dull compared to the previous formula.",1432684800,2015-05-27

It is the only thing that will work but sometimes the company gets the colors mixed up. Meaning, sometimes they place the veil powder in with the setting powder so the colors are never the same. I had to write them to get the correct shade. Since then I have not had any issues.

I use setting powder because I have the fairest skin there is. I can never find anything at the drugstores or stores that carry the light shade I need. My routine, I wash my face with soap. I then use an astringent on it. I then use an oil free serum. Then I place a thin light oil free foundation on. I let it sit for a few minutes then apply the setting powder. After, I wait another few minutes and finish with a light pressed powder. I then leave the house with the pressed powder and use it as needed through the night but am usually told my face is flawless. It took me a long time to figure out what steps to take and what products.

For the price, this is a much better value. The other one I use comes in a bag and you have to have your own container and powder puff. I like that this is all together and also cheaper. The other one cost more and you only get  of the amount. I used this for a week to make sure I loved it, I do! I already use the parent company Loreal so I will be buying this one from now on.

This is perfect for some many things but really great for fair skin and keeping your face from shinning. It gives it a matte look which I love! It also looks natural, as if you have nothing on. I am glad I found this. I will be making the switch.",1453680000,2016-01-25

5.0,"It's important to know where reviews on products like these are coming from. I'm 29 and a female who happens to enjoy wearing fragrances marketed towards males and females. If it smells good on my skin, I will gladly wear it. Other fragrances I use are JPG Le Male Terrible (for men), D&G Light Blue (for women), Burberry Brit Summer (for men), Armani Code (for men), John Varvatos Vintage (for men and my present favorite), CK Euphoria (for women) and Versace Dreamer.

This is by far my favorite scent. I think it's a little immature to think that only a man or only a woman can wear a certain scent, if you like it, you should wear it! That being said, this cologne makes me think of someone who is refined and neat and secretly a bit of a sexy bad ass.

The entire life of this fragrance is amazing. From opening notes to the dry down to the last little bit of fragrance that lingers at the end of the day. The worst thing about it is that it only lasts about 3 or 4 hours on me. I have been told that I leave my smell behind on other people's clothes or their furniture, so maybe it just becomes undetectable to me at 3 or 4 hours. Also, the only people to ever compliment me on this product are people (women) that come within a foot or two of me- this is fine as I don't want to be the ass that is creating scent pollution in the office! I have only purchased from retail stores, so I cannot speak to the service or product delivered by Amazon but, If you're looking for an original fragrance that is spicy and sweet but not too sweet, you should give this stuff a try!

This product is solid and comes in a jar with a scoop. You remove a small amount, warm it up, and apply. The color was a good match for me skin, but although I took the ""less is more"" approach, it highlighted every pore and imperfection. I tried it again with a primer first, and it looked better, but still not something I could use on my whole face. It is also not full coverage, as it did not completely cover a small red dot I have on my forehead.

The package is larger than many eye creams.  It had no obnoxious fragrance.

It felt good. Here's what I found: it seemed to work better on the eye puffiness above my eye, rather than helping the circles under my eye.  I can't imagine buying two different products for such areas in close proximity.  The Clinique salesperson insisted I needed two, one for under eye and one for lid, and at over $50 that as just nuts. I don't have that kind of time or money.

I used this on both.  But the results, as I said, were more effective on puffiness.  I noticed too that if I put it on in the morning, it didn't give me any trouble (pilling or such) when I put on primer and foundation. It also didn't conflict with my shadow primer.  So many primers!

2.0,"I have very fair skin. Tanning is not an option (who wants to take that risk?!). So, I rely on self-tanners to make me a little less translucent/glow-in-the-dark white in the summer months. Now, for me, this product didn't really provide that sun-kissed look I was seeking. The color was just ... off. I also found it difficult to use the product since the contents are clear; therefore, it was difficult to feel assured that the results would be consistent.

Now, as with all tanners, do exfoliate before using this. I like a sea-salt scrub ... but I know some people who like a sugar-scrub. Both have the same general results (but, for me, most sugar scrubs have a slick finish that conflicts with the tanning lotion). Exfoliating should prevent some of the dark patches that some folks are experiencing.

The scent is okay and the mitt is a really nice touch.

Secondly, when it put it on the area that has crow's feet wrinkles, it stung a bit.  I could feel it tightening the skin, but it felt like too much acid or something - definitely irritated my skin.  Thankfully my skin didn't get red.  I actually didn't see any difference, I only felt it..  I really don't tolerate this eye cream well at all.

5.0,"First, the compact-
This is a really nice compact that can be used for other colors as well if you like.  Other colors I've seen for around $7-15.  It has a very nice, big mirror that is well made and does not distort.  The compact opens and closes easily, and is a good size to fit in a purse.  It holds 3 of the colors and the pen.  The top can be lifted up on one side to slide the squares out or to replace one or all of them.  It has a textured pattern on the top and overall is very good quality and very attractive.

The makeup
This is a creamy powder with a lot of pigment.  When it first arrived, I tried a bit with my fingers- this is not the optimal way of using this!  I ended up with a stripe I could not blend.  However, when used with a brush, these colors are marvelously easy to blend.  It only takes a single pass of a brush to pick up pigment, and it does not make a lot of powder waste on the compact.
It comes with instructions for using it on cheeks and as a whole face bronzer.  The colors do work very well for a very natural bronzer, and it worked well for me, and I am very fair skinned.  It is easy to customize it to the color you need- if you have darker skin, you might simply use more of the darker color.

It has a little highlighter pen that is wonderful when used around the top lip, on the browbone, or on the bridge of the nose if you wish to highlight that area.  It is a very pearlized shade, and for me, I prefer just to use it on my browbone, under my eyebrows, and to line my upper lip with.

All this said, my favorite use for this is to minimize the appearance of this double chin age and weight gain has cursed me with.  This is very good makup for contouring the chin line and minimizing the neck.  Because it does blend so well, it is easy to blend it down into the neck without an obvious 'line of demarcation.'

Next, it has such a pleasant smell. Not a traditional baby smell, yet very appropriate for a baby - and it's mild, not over powering. The lotions and creams are thick so a little dab will do ya, so it will last a good while. We have been using daily for over a week and can hardly tell any has been used.

This is a great baby gift set.",1492905600,2017-04-23

3.0,"Im a big fan of the LANZA haircare line and have been using their shampoo and conditioners for many years now.  This Healing Oil Hair Treatment just doesnt seem to suit my fine textured hair.  Even when I use just the tiniest amount, my hair seems to fall flat and lacks body or volume.

While this product does contain some interesting oils, the first three ingredients are all silicone or silicone-based.  Unfortunately, silicone just seems to weigh my hair down.  Ill use it in a pinch to fight the frizzies when the humidity is high, and of course it does add a nice shine.  As to the manufacturers claim that it decreases drying time by 65%, I didn't find that to be the case.

Bottom Line:  Silicone based products just don't work for my hair type, no matter how fancy the other ingredients may be.",1501200000,2017-07-28
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

It applies smoothly and without pulling. The consistency is creamy and the line goes on solid and not chunky or dry. The best part I think is its performance over time. Once it sets, it doesnt wipe off, smear or fade. The color stays easily for about 4 hours. I am fair and the colors look rich and warm, and work well fully lined or just as a defining tool and it layers well with other products. Easily above average performance.",1487808000,2017-02-23

The cleansing soap is a little thick but thats the way it should be.  Message a small amount of cleansing soap onto your skin in a circular motion.  Rinse with warm water.  My skin felt clean and not dry.

Made for ALL skin types.  This product is made in the USA.

I will be adding this cleaning soap to my daily washing regiment.  I really liked it.

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

This does not linger long; however, it is enough for me to avoid this product in favor of a fragrance free option.

I don't have serious skin flaws that require masking, just little flaws with room for improvement so I just use a thin layer of powder. That's all I need. A little bit makes a big improvement in the appearance of my skin. I don't really need to build it up, but if you have problem areas you can build it up where you need to.

Skin powder diffuses light so your face is not so shiny. I don't care about shiny skin except when it comes to photos and selfies, and then powder makes a big difference in how the picture comes out. Without powder, my face looks weird in pictures. If you are going somewhere and you think someone is going to take your picture, be sure to put on some powder.

I used to use foundation with translucent powder, but I like this solution better, especially in the summer. The powder camo works all by itself, and it is light and quick to put on. Very nice stuff.",1498435200,2017-06-26

3.0,"This Mustela stretch mark prevention cream is white in color and has the consistency of lotion.  It goes on easily, absorbed into my skin quickly, light weight and not greasy at all.  I feel like it made my skin feel really soft and smooth.  The big downfall for me was how strong the fragrance is.  I am super sensitive to smells.  I can't walk into the bath and body store in the mall without getting a headache.  I don't wear perfume or anything really heavily scented because it gives me a headache.  I can use scented products if the scent is light, subtle and fades fast.  I was disappointed that this stretch mark prevention cream has a heavy floral scent.  While the scent is good, it is heavy and lasting so I couldn't take the scent and eventually had to wash it off.  I also want to mention in my first trimester (and most of my second) I has horrible morning sickness and was incredibly sensitive to smells/fragrances (they made my nausea so much worse).  I had to use fragrance free everything or I would have a headache, the nausea would be intensified and I would be sick.  Just something to keep in mind if you are pregnant, really nauseous and sensitive to fragrance than this might not work for you.  If you have no issues with fragrance than this prevention cream will make your skin feel soft and smooth!  This cream is hypoallergenic, and free from parabens, phthalates, phenoxyethanol, bisphenols A and S, caffeine and alcohol.  Overall I thought the cream felt nice on my skin and made it feel soft but I can't comment on the stretch mark prevention because I was unable to use it consistently due to the fragrance.

5.0,"If you're suffering from winter-dry skin that is flaky, tight, red, and/or slightly lined, this is the moisturizer for you.

The cream comes in a 1.7 oz. size, at a price of $32.00. If that seems expensive, consider that you will only need a very small (nickel-size or slightly larger) amount to cover your entire face. (Go for the slightly larger amount if you want to cover your neck.)

The jar itself is glass, and comes sealed with a foil tamper-proof seal. The jar is pretty enough to leave out on a vanity or bathroom counter. The scent of the cream (at least to me) was light, and pleasant. I could pick up the shea butter smell (familiar with it from other L'occitane products), as well as hints of lemon. A very soothing smell.

Besides smelling good, this cream does a wonderful job of smoothing the skin, and leaving a nice glow. Within two uses, some dry patches on my cheeks were gone, as was the dry, chapped skin on the backs of my hands! (I used the ""extra"" on my hands after applying it to my face and neck.) I use it strictly as a night cream, since it does NOT contain SPF. I have found that it absorbs well, and does not stain or rub off on pillowcases. (Also, because it is so thick and rich, I think it is a little heavy for a day cream --even if it did contain spf--, especially in the warmer months.)

Like many L'Occitane products, this one feels luxurious on the skin, and provides the benefits promised. I received this jar from the Amazon Vine program, but I've bought it before on my own (at Sephora), and will do so again. To me, it's worth the price.

One note: if you have oily or combination skin, you might want to try this ONLY on dry areas of your face. Otherwise, it might be too heavy for your skin type.",1427328000,2015-03-26
4.0,"These work great at removing eye makeup.  They leave my eyes feeling refreshed and remove everything easily. They come out of the package damp and ready to go.

I do not use these to remove the rest of my face makeup, as they are not as gentle for the rest of the face. However I do not think these were intended for your face but rather specific for eyes. I do not wear a ton of eye makeup (mascara and a little eye shadow), so I always have a lot of the cloth left over after my eye makeup is removed. If you wear a lot of eye makeup, these would be great and you would get more use out of each cloth.",1482796800,2016-12-27
3.0,"As I write this in November in the Midwest, I can't really speak to the sunscreen performance of this Juice Beauty SPF 30 Sport Sunscreen.  I'll take the manufacturer at their word that it will perform as an SPF 30 protectant.

Claims, including reviewers ravings, of wonderful organic fundamentals notwithstanding . . . the product derives it sun screening protection from good old zinc oxide (20%), just like nearly all the other sunscreen creams, lotions, and sprays.  The organic/mineral/natural marketing milieu regards only the carrier crme which likely does have beneficial moisturizing and rejuvenating properties.  The tube indicates that this is ""Certified Organic"".

How do I like it?  As I said, I assume it does provide SPF 30 protection.  The 3.75 oz tube is a convenient take along size which I prefer to the harder to carrier jumbo tubes and bottles offered elsewhere.  Directions advise to shake before using.  Do that.

The crme is skin toned (Caucasian anyway).  Helps prevent that white look, but can also stain white clothing. Odor is interesting.  Not that familiar coconut tropical odor you get poolside on the cruise ship (which I like, by the way).  This is more an earthy scent with a hint of citrus.  Not disagreeable, but very different from the herd.

I don't care for the texture of the residue after application.  It feels like a powder which was suspended in grease. It hangs around -- not powdery, not greasy . . . or maybe it's both.  Either way, it's annoying and seems to not want to go away.  On the upside, it does indeed seem to moisturize and nourish the skin.  And it does not wash off easily.

In summary, an effective zinc oxide sunscreen that is different from the pack.  Organic ingredients.  Earthy scent.  Annoying texture.  Moisturizes effectively.",1416009600,2014-11-15

It does hydrate my lips and the color stays on for a long time. I love lipstick and lip glosses and this is the first time I have ever tried Jouer and so far, I like this brand. I normally don't spend this much on lipstick as a mom of tweens, I just don't have the time to even swipe on lipstick before rushing out the door. I might reconsider that decision now that I have tried this brand.

The only problem I have with this is that Vine gave me this shade, which is a lot brighter and a lot pinker than what it seems on the screen of my computer. I am not a bright pink lipstick kind of lady ... I am more into the roses and mauves. So fair warning, this shade is a bit brighter than what it seems on the computer screen.

Other than that, I am pleased with this product. Who knows? Maybe the bright pink will grow on me.

This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.

4.0,"Scent is a personal preference. I really like the Burberry Body Tender scent and have been complimented on it. It's described as being the youthful twist on the Burberry Body line. It still smells grown up, but not too musky. This lotion is not meant to moisturize your skin. It is can be worn on it's own so you just get a light scent. You can wear it with the Body Tender perfume on top to make the scent last longer. Or you can use it as a base for layering a different Body perfume on top for your own scent.  The Body Tender Milk is very light and goes on smoothly.  It pumps out only a small amount at a time. Which allows you to control how much you put on a little at a time. It comes in the same bottle design as all the other Body products.

5.0,"It's important to know where reviews on products like these are coming from. I'm 29 and a female who happens to enjoy wearing fragrances marketed towards males and females. If it smells good on my skin, I will gladly wear it. Other fragrances I use are JPG Le Male Terrible (for men), D&G Light Blue (for women), Burberry Brit Summer (for men), Armani Code (for men), John Varvatos Vintage (for men and my present favorite), CK Euphoria (for women) and Versace Dreamer.

This is by far my favorite scent. I think it's a little immature to think that only a man or only a woman can wear a certain scent, if you like it, you should wear it! That being said, this cologne makes me think of someone who is refined and neat and secretly a bit of a sexy bad ass.

The entire life of this fragrance is amazing. From opening notes to the dry down to the last little bit of fragrance that lingers at the end of the day. The worst thing about it is that it only lasts about 3 or 4 hours on me. I have been told that I leave my smell behind on other people's clothes or their furniture, so maybe it just becomes undetectable to me at 3 or 4 hours. Also, the only people to ever compliment me on this product are people (women) that come within a foot or two of me- this is fine as I don't want to be the ass that is creating scent pollution in the office! I have only purchased from retail stores, so I cannot speak to the service or product delivered by Amazon but, If you're looking for an original fragrance that is spicy and sweet but not too sweet, you should give this stuff a try! The most noticeable notes all throughout are cinnamon, leather and vanilla. Words cannot express how much I love this juice!",1368489600,2013-05-14
4.0,"My 17 year old has been struggling with acne for a while now but resists using most products because she is very sensitive to how various products smell.  She's also not very consistent in sticking with a skin care routine but had shown some improvement using a 3 step skin care line.  However, the acne kept returning or would just flare up suddenly.

I had her replace the toner she was using with this Effaclar Clarifying Solution and, after a couple of weeks of nightly use, her skin looks smoother and calmer.  Areas that are particularly breakout prone have started to heal.  She has fair skin but isn't too sensitive so has had no issues with dry or flaky skin.  She does still use her regular face soap and then follows the toner with a light moisturizer.  I think the salicylic acid provided just the boost her routine needed to clear up those stubborn areas.  I plan on replacing this for her when it runs out rather than have her return to what she was using.",1457136000,2016-03-05

How strange.  Personally, I would not pay either amount for this product, even though I like it, because it seems no different to me than your average exfoliating cream.  It does do a good job exfoliating, although it makes my face feel a bit tight.  Also, while I like the scent, it lingers too much on my face.

3.0,"The Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Hand Cream was not impressive in my opinion. It is a lightweight cream which goes on smoothly and is well absorbed. It is a little too well absorbed for my skin. Two applications back to back weren't enough to make my hands feel moisturized.

Being a fan of scented hand cream, as long as they are pleasant, I was really hoping this would smell like green apples. It took a little while before I was able to decide that it reminds me of Pledge furniture polish. It is slightly lemony scented, not over-powering and the smell seemed to quickly fade.

The Juice Beauty line boasts that their products are organic. This hand cream does appear to contain some very healthy ingredients. But not everything in it is organic. You'll want to keep this mind as you consider making your purchase.

I'm including an ingredients list:

Organic juices of aloe barbadensis (organic aloe juice)*, pyrus malus (organic apple juice)*,  vitis vinifera (organic white grape juice)*, citrus medica limonum (organic lemon juice)*, vegetable glycerin,  helianthus annuus (organic sunflower seed oil)*, ethylhexyl palmitate, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glyceryl stearate, stearic acid,  palmitoyl pentapeptide-4, acetyl hexapeptide-3,  cetearyl alcohol, organic plant oils of butyrospermum parkii (organic shea butter)*, simmondsia chinensis (organic jojoba seed oil)*, oenothera biennis (organic evening primrose oil)*, linum usitatissimum (organic linseed oil)*, borago officinalis (organic borage seed oil)*, xanthan gum, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (Vitamin C), panthenol (Vitamin B5), allantoin, tocopherol (Vitamin E), ethylhexylglycerin, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, citrus reticulata (mandarin), litsea cubeba (may chang) and cinnamomum camphora (ho wood) pure essential oils

While I am not offended by the smell of this product, I am underwhelmed with it's performance for the price. I've not used it long enough to know if it in fact does diminish the fine lines on hands. I'm doubtful that it would in my case since it is not providing enough hydration for my dry skin.

I'll finish the tube and then probably return to using Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Hand Cream for daily basis.

The cleanser is largely scentless, light-feeling, and leaves no residue on your skin. I have very tough skin, lots of huge pores, and have recently started getting menopause-related acne. This seems to take care of the greasy and reddish spotting I was getting and also dried up any of the cysts that had already made themselves noticeable.

The directions say you can use it 3 times a day  but, as tough as my skin is, I feel like once a day is plenty and more would be too drying.

I was using La Mer for a while but really can't afford to plunk down my kids college savings on a face cream and that led me on a search for the product/s to help my dry/combination skin and my pocket. Make no mistake L'Occitane products are not cheap; they are high quality and one of the best brands currently in Europe, I bought some of their products in Switzerland and France. I'm using their Divine Youth Oil which is amazing as a rejuvenating serum, which led me to give this moisturizer a try. At first I was leery because it says that is Ultra Rich, but this cream is not greasy at all, it dissolves nicely into the skin, also feels silky and delicate. I could just spread this stuff on my face all day! Anyhow, it is very thick so usually I have a little plastic spoon to scoop out the cream. It smells wonderful and it doesn't irritate my skin, since it does tend to react to some fragrances in creams. Immediately your skin will feel nurtured and radiant, after two weeks you will see that it feels amazing.

I'm definitely a fan of L'Occitane and feel confident that I found the cream my skin needed!",1427587200,2015-03-29

I was wrong.  Even from the first use, it took longer than normal for the hair to return.  Each use (a week apart for 7 treatments) caused the hair to take longer to come back, until it didn't come back at all.  Iluminage requires you to shave prior to the treatment, then use the system on the shaved areas.  There are parts of my body (specifically, the inner, upper thighs) that always has stubble, even immediately after shaving.  Using the iluminage on those areas ""burns"" the stubble, making the area smooth and hair free, which surprised me (since it supposedly needs complete hair removal for the system to work.

5.0,"When you sniff it straight from the jar it smells like cheap cologne but once you put a smidgeon on your hair the fragrance is more subtle and pleasant, with that minty smell of other bath products. More importantly it doesn't leave your hair feeling too stiff or sticky, like other products I've used. If you use it sparingly, it gives your hair a light hold and a nice shine. My only qualm is the packaging - it's easy to mistake this ""paste"" for the real thing and I'm afraid that if I leave it on the shelf where a child might see it, she will mistake it for an Elmer's Glue product and ruin the stuff. I get the ""manly"" packaging (no-nonsense, kind of hipsterish in celebrating the basics) but it feels gimmicky to me and I wish the package would more clearly state what it's meant to be used for (instead of just saying ""PASTE"" why not add a second line saying ""HAIR POMADE""?). Otherwise, this is a quality product.",1474675200,2016-09-24
4.0,"My sister recommended Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, so I decided to give it a try. One very big positive is the price. In my experience, many skin care products are scams that can cost a fortune. 17.00 is a fair price for this product. The lotion (thought it's not really a lotion) contains salicylic acid and chamomile. Most people probably know that salicylic acid is a very common and inexpensive product used to treat acne, which can also reduce redness. Chamomile is also used to reduce redness, so the formula of combining the two seems like a good idea.

The directions are simple. Apply your usual nighttime moisturizer before applying the drying lotion. Make sure you allow your moisturizer to dry thoroughly before applying the drying lotion. Then, dip a qutip in the bottle of drying lotion, and apply it to problem areas on your face. Make sure to buy extra long qutips because regular qutips barely reach the bottom of the bottle. Once you have used about half of the product, you are going to want an extra long qutip.

Now, how effective is this product? I think it is just as effective as something like Proactiv. The drying lotion is not a miracle by any means. Does it work? Yes, it works to some extent. It works to the extent that salicylic acid has always worked. Will you have dramatically clearer skin overnight? No. Will you have clearer skin after a few days? Yes. But this product is not a miracle or a new formulation that we have never seen before, and this product does not prevent acne. Many of the reviews fail to mention that this product is actually intended for use on whiteheads. I rarely have whiteheads, so I mainly used the drying lotion on your average red pimples. So I can say that the product does work on average pimples to an extent, but it's no better than Proactive, Retin-A, or anything else you might have tried. I tried the drying lotion on a few whiteheads, and, again, it's not a miracle worker. It works as effectively as most other products I have tried.

I will buy this product again for two reasons: the price is fair, and I do not want to pay a dermatologist to prescribe me benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. The dying lotion is a good product, but it's not a miracle. Set your expectations reasonably, and you should be fine.",1473638400,2016-09-12

4.0,"The best thing I can say for this polish is it dries quickly and contains no formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate, toluene, formaldehyde resin or camphor.  It also made my nails stronger and harder than *any* other nail polish.

If what I see in the bottle transferred to my nails, I would've been one happy gal. Alas, it doesn't.  The bottle makes the polish look black with lots of glitter mixed throughout.  What brushes onto my fingers, however, is clear with very few glitter pieces and a few larger black U-shaped flecks.  When I showed my husband, he said it looked like I had been digging through a garbage filled with coffee grounds.  To see what he saw, please see the picture attached to this review.

EDIT 6/11/2015: When I told my daughter how unhappy I was with how this polish looked, she went to the product page -- and then promptly laughed at me.  It seems as though the larger black flecks are supposed to look like leopard print, and the glitter was there (but not visible) because it's supposed to go over the top of a darker nail polish.  Silly me!  I have to admit, it would look prettier over a darker color, and the glitter would have shown up quite nicely.  However, this grandmother doesn't think too much of the ""leopard print.""  Maybe in my younger years, but not so much any more.  However, because I obviously didn't know enough about this stylin' polish when I originally wrote the review, I've changed it from 2 stars - 4 stars.

5.0,"I love this Moisture Primer even more than I expected!

First, it provides a light, non-greasy moisture.  It smooths on easily, dries fast, and feels refreshing. It's chalked full of good things for the skin, which I love.  My skin already feels smoother and softer, and I'm sure as I use it longer, I'll start to notice the anti-aging benefits of the hyaluronic acid and other antioxidants.

Next, it helps my make up apply easily, smoothly, and last longer.  It leaves my made-up face looking smooth, and really enhances my make-up.  I can absolutely tell a difference on the days I use this, compared to those days I skip it.

As I'm writing this review, I realize I haven't even noticed a smell from the primer.  The container is rather small--I do wish it came with a little more in it.

3.0,"I used to go to a top dermatologist in Beverly Hills and he told me that SkinMedica products were the best. The one he touted most highly was their TNS Essential Serum and I used that one for a long time. The only reason I stopped was because it just became too expensive.

By the way, as far as being expensive, I don't like to take any stars off of any product because of its price; I believe a review should reflect how a product works and if it does what its supposed to do.

Saying that, I was really excited to try this because I am such a fan of SkinMedica products and because this product sounded like the perfect fix for the dryness on my face and neck from aging. Plus, I also really liked how you can use this rejuvenating hydrator either before or after moisturizer and I did try it both ways.

So why not 5 stars? Because unfortunately, for me, this product really didn't help. If anything, I thought it made my skin feel even drier. After a couple of weeks and after trying it on different parts of my body - i.e. neck and upper chest - I finally threw in the towel and decided it wasn't for me.

An additional issue, is that if you have telangiectasia like I do, this product might only make it worse and it made my face look  flushed. Not good.

So this was a difficult review for me because I think that this company makes quality products and I think this would probably be a boon to most people. But for someone like me - someone who has telangiectasia and very sensitive skin - this proved to be more detrimental than good.",1526601600,2018-05-18
5.0,"When I opened the box for this I thought ""Really? They could jack up my face and run a new one under it for that price"". The bottle is a little bigger than my thumb.

I suggest you do a ""test-patch"" on your inner elbow before you put this on your face. You can read the ingredients by enlarging the thumbnail photos on the left of the product page. You won't be able to read them on the actual box without a powerful magnifying glass.

When they say ""oil"" that's what it is, about the consistency of mineral oil. It has a very subtle citrusy scent.

After cleaning my face I only use a couple of drops to cover my face. (If you use too much you will be a greasy mess and it will take some time to absorb.) Over that I use a vitamin ""C"" serum then, after a little time for that to absorb, I apply a moisturizer. It leaves my face warm and a little pink for about five minutes.

The results? First I have to tell you I'm leery of any cosmetic that makes extravagant claims so I wasn't expecting much.  I am pleasantly surprised. After just a week my skin looks much better. The fine lines at the corners of my eyes are less and a line on my forehead is less obvious. Is it the oil or is it because it helps the ""C"" serum to absorb better?  I don't know but whatever it is it seems to work. Is it worth the cost? I'm still debating that.",1430870400,2015-05-06
5.0,"My daughter has a scar right in the center of her upper chest and she's quite self-conscious about it, often trying to 'hide' it with a big pendant or other jewelry so she was quite happy to try this product. Voila - it was quite the ""quick-fix"" for her problem.

She gently applied a thin layer over the scar (which is pink) against her very pale skin -- and this color matched her skin tone well. She waited a few minutes and then built more coverage with a couple of extra strokes. Then, following the directions, she set the foundation by applying a coat of transluscent face powder. You can barely see any blemish as the coverage is great. It makes her feel much more confident and that makes me happy too!

I'm not sure how well this item would do for extensive disfiguring blemishes, but it works well on the fairly superficial ones. Also ""erases"" visible capillaries such as those on the side of the nose, and other small imperfections much better than regular foundation products. You don't need a lot of it either.

3.0,"What I like:

I like that the razor is adjustable and has numeric settings. Setting ""1"" is the mildest setting giving the least amount of blade exposure. Rotating the razor head will allow the head to raise exposing more blade for a setting up to ""6"".

The sound that the razor makes as it goes over whiskers is musical. The shape of the razor head creates an acoustic chamber amplifying the sound of whiskers being cut.

Open areas of the cheek are a pleasure to shave, and this razor plows right through. Definitely cool looking, and effective.

What I don't like:

Shaving under the nose. The razor head is HUGE, and that makes it difficult to get to tight areas such as this. I've cut myself while trying to shave under the nose as this is where the design is not friendly, or effective. I have to literally pull my nose up to shave my upper lip. The large head also affects shaving sideways and has cause a few nicks.

The handle is smooth, which becomes quite slippery once wet with soap. There is no knurling.

That said, my associated white spots could still use some extra shading.

Dermablend suggests setting the foundation station with their powder, which might help any transference to things like my phone, but I haven't had any other issues with the foundation coming off or smearing, even when sweating. I spent the day outside, very hot with decent cloud coverage, but I didn't notice any darkening in skin tone the next day, so I'd say the SPF works well. All in all, I was impressed by this.

4.0,"Julep has become a product I use for my nails. I love the colors, the ease of application and the staying power of the nail polish. Now, I have tried Julep's blush.

 I am glad that this product was offered to me. The color of this pink blush is very bright, and I may not have tried it. However, the brightness of the blush is not the color delivered to your cheeks. Applied lightly with a blush brush, we have a light pink hue glow. This is lovely, one of the prettiest blush colors I have tried. I have light skin, and this blush brightens my face. The glow looks natural, and is not heavy or too much. I very much like this blush. The compact has a mirror, and this completes this small blush compact.

4.0,"I am not very good at styling my hair, never used a rod curling iron, and found this one very easy to use.  The glove (which I had also never used) made it easy to wrap my hair and hold it in place without worrying about burning myself.  I  have very thick, coarse hair that is hard to curl and my curls held it all day with no hairspray.  I was expecting to have to flat iron it after my first attempt but to my surprise it looked good and with just a little more practice would look even better.  I expected the rod curling iron to be tapered like most others I have seen, but it is all the same width, so it looks just like a traditional curling iron but without the clip.

The only reason I took off one star is because I do not see the benefits of using a rod curling iron over the old fashioned type of curling iron that clips the end of your hair.  The two minor issues I had would have been solved with a regular curling iron--it was hard to get the curl all the way down to the ends of my hair, and my arms got tired having to do my whole head.  With a regular curling iron I only have to hold the rod with one hand and can switch off but this style of curling iron requires the use of both hands the whole time.",1520726400,2018-03-11
4.0,"First, I am in my early 40's, love to be in the sun and have always appeared younger than my age.  I wear very little make-up, generally only makeup on my eyes and maybe a bit of bronzer.
That said, I did not see the immediate removal of the fine lines around my eyes or mouth after use. What I did see an immediate improvement in the appearance of my skin.  Difficult to describe but, my skin seemed brighter-not the faux puffy that you can get with some creams, this is an improvement in the texture and balancing the overall color of my skin.  In the AM skin can look a bit ""ruddy"" with inconsistent coloring.  This helps to balance it. I am really happy with it and makes me less worried about running to the store or taking the kids to practice without taking time to put on make up.  There are many reviews out there celebrating lifting of brows and jowls-the small electrical current should contract the muscles and tighten them, like your face doing ab crunches, makes sense to me-so I am faithfully starting my day with the less than 5 min routine.
The unit should have no feeling, so if you feel ""cold"" or ""pulsing"" it is because you need a bit more gel and turning down the unit.  I could not, however, find a way to use it on my neck without discomfort.  There are several suggestions for less expensive gel's to use once the NuFace gel has run out but for only $12 for a 2oz tube, I plan to stick with theirs.

I use it at night and in the morning before applying a foundation.

For my 50+ year old tough New England skin, which used to be sensitive, its very nice. I wish I had taken a before and after photo, it seems to help make my skin smoother and firm up minor wrinkles that are appearing, but I cant tell and there are multiple products at work here.

5.0,"L'Occitane has long been offering this version of shea butter. The company had it way before shea butter was accepted by mainstream companies, who then added to their health and beauty lines, either as a stand alone ingredient or combined with other ingredients to make it fragrant or to make it cheaper. However, if you want the best, the most drenchingly moisturizing, the longest lasting skin (and even hair!) moisturizer, use this one. Shea butter comes from the nuts of the African Kante tree. It is a wonderful purveyor of Vitamin A.
L'Occitaine's Pure Shea Butter is both organic and Fair Trade Approved.
You can layer this product with L'Occitaine's lighter versions (their hand and foot creams which contain less shea, for example) but if you want the heavy hitter, get this: the one, the only, the original, by L'Occitaine.

5.0,"I am already a fan of most Stila products.  But this was my first time trying this foundation product. I have their SPF moisturizer foundation and I loved that.  Stayed put and was great in FL sunshine for a Disney trip.  Was curious about this as it has that illuminator effect and I like that idea.

It feels a bit lighter than their other foundation, but I don't mind that as I like lighter make up and don't like heavy feeling things on my face.  Also don't like a heavy make-up look.  I like a natural looking make up that adds a bit of polish and glow.  This does the trick ... flawlessly.  Smooths out my skin tones (Irish scottish heritage with freckles and some uneven skin tones) doesn't hide my freckles (why would you do that?) but does add a bit of light and finish while blending some pink tones down a bit.

If you are looking for serious foundation coverage this is probably not for you.  It is not a heavy coverage type of thing, it is a evening and translucent type of light reflecting thing.  A nice glow with some light.  There is no actual sparkle in this, it is just lightens or makes the skin glow... like it is lit.  Very nice and youthful look.  You still need some SPF if you are in the sun.... as this is not an SPF product, which I also liked as if I am indoors all day I do not want nor need an SPF on my skin.

Just add a small squirt into the palm of the hand, add a little water, work gently into a lather, apply liberally to the face, then rinse off. It didn't sting my eyes at all, and washed away every bit of my waterproof mascara. To test how clean my skin was, I used some clarifying lotion on a cotton pad and found no trace of makeup on the pad. I found the scent a bit off-putting though - it smells like you're rubbing salad oil onto your face. Though I'm not a fan of overly perfumed products, it seems that in this case, a bit of added scent might have been helpful. The oil washes off easily, leaving no detectable residue, so I applied my usual moisturizer afterwards.

4.0,"First let's look at the Trinity device itself and then we'll get into the Wrinkle Reducer Attachment. The NuFACE Trinity makes a big promise: Use and you will see your skin plump and firm to reduce the signs of aging. Does it work? YES. Is it the easiest or most convenient product ever invented? NO. Read on.

Process: After washing your face, you will apply the gel primer to the areas you want to target. Because the gel dries very fast I break up my face into three treatment areas: forehead/brows, left side of face, right side of face. Following the 'beep' of the device, you glide the NuFACE over the area three times. There are many techniques you can use to do this. For example, your cheek/side of face is divided into three sections: along the jaw, in the hollows of your cheeks, and on your cheek bone. You glide over EACH area three times, slowly, in tune to the beep of the device. You can also use a hold technique where you leave the device in one place for the beep cycle. This is particularly effective on your nasolabial folds and for picking up your eyebrows. When you are finished you will wash the gel primer off with a warm wash-cloth. You can then apply moisturizer and either makeup (if using in AM) or night creams (if using in PM).

Results: You will see results instantly. I notice them most in my smile lines and in my brows/the 'elevens' between my eyes. Let me explain. The effect is two-fold. The lines are plumped so you no longer see the smile lines or the 'elevens'. There is also a slight paralysis effect in that you can smile and the lines don't come back. Very neat. I hate my down-turned brows. I have taught myself to constantly hold them up using my forehead muscles. The NuFACE creates the same result I get when holding my brows up. My brows easily stay up about a centimeter from where they would be in resting position. This makes me look more awake and less grumpy- definitely a plus!

Drawbacks:
-The biggest drawback is that the results are temporary. After about 6 hours your face is back to normal. Therefore if you want the results, you'll need to use everyday day and night which brings me to the second drawback...
-Time is a big issue. For a full treatment with optimal results, you need about 20-30 minutes. I find if I do a ""quickie"" the results aren't near as noticeable and fade quickly. If you have the time to spend an hour a day on your face, you'll have no issues. For those of us who need every minute of every day for work/life... it gets old even though the results are great. It's still a great investment for those nights out when you want to look fabulous. I actually first heard about the product in an ELLE magazine article about stylists and makeup artists who used it to prep celebrities before an award show so they would look younger and refreshed.
-I hate how the gel primer feels. It's similar to smearing your face with syrup or jelly. I just do not like the sensation. Then it is thick so you have to work it off with the washcloth.

Wrinkle Reducer Attachment: I have experimented with facial LEDs before with mixed results. The blue acne lights did nothing for my skin. This attachment (red light) promises to ease fine lines and wrinkles. I noticed a small difference when using just the light attachment. My fine lines did seem smaller and less noticeable. Where you really see the difference is when you use it with the NuFACE toner program. Overall I would recommend spending the additional amount to get the Wrinkle Reducer Attachment. Personally, I would not spend the additional amount to get the ELE attachment. I will also be writing a review for that attachment which you can check out if you're interested.",1440892800,2015-08-30

This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.

Vitamin C, licorice, white birch: brightens to illuminate under eye discoloration
Caffeine: reduces appearance of puffiness

Does it do all that? Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say it does, at least not for the first three times I've used it. The eye cream doesn't say it works better over time, just that it helps each time you use it. Frankly, I just like that it's a good eye cream that'll keep the skin around my eyes from feeling dry and doesn't irritate my eyes.

- it has a reverse pump so that basically the interior base rises as you pump instead of sucking air back into the tube. This could make the cream last longer and keeps it cleaner.
- the cream is a think white cream that easily spreads on skin and disappears, so there is no unsightly acne cream look to it
- it left my skin super smooth, and it could swear it smoothed a few lines

Worked great, for just about 1 year.  Now the battery will no longer hold a charge at all.  Which is incredibly sad when you are paying so much for a product that works really well.

===========================================

My wife likes to call this her ""little genie"".  The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.

My wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.  As others have stated, soak it in hydrogen peroxide every few weeks.

Kind of pricey, but well made and certainly worth it.

The lid color goes on very smoothly, though it took me three swipes to get the depth that I wanted. The lighter shade is very light, though the darker shade is very dark. It seems like this set would have been better represented with a third shade, between the two.

Likewise, the color is shimmering, so it won't work well for a matte look.

2.0,"I'm going to go through this point by point because I really wanted to like this product but found it lacking in several areas.

First, the applicator. You push up on a ""button"" at the bottom to get the product onto the brush. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - as in you get nothing, or you get too much, or if you're lucky it's just right.''

Second, the color. It looks much darker than it is, and once applied it gives a *tiny* bit of shimmer if you use enough, but not much more than that. Additionally, when I put it on over my makeup, it basically 'washed' my makeup off. When I tried to put it on first and then put makeup over it (both options are suggested on the product's box, by the way), my makeup, which is very light in terms of coverage, hid what little ""illumination"" this product offered.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19
3.0,"When it comes to protecting your skin in the summer, using the right sunscreen with UVA/UVB protection is of the uptmost importance. However, if thats all it has, it won't be enough. Your sunscreen also needs to protect skin from infrared-A (aka IRA) rays as well, and heres why. Besides the sun, these rays can also come from less-obvious places. When you blow-dry your hair, or even get a gel manicure, your skin is exposed to them. IRA rays travel even deeper into skin than UVA and UVB rays, causing free radicals that further accelerate skin aging. What you're left with are fine lines and wrinkles no matter how much sunscreen you're putting on.  With all that said, we now understand why we need sunscreen. Sunscreen is now the new skincare standard.  We must use sunscreen to fight aging.  In paricular, we must use a sunscreen with infrared protection.  I have been using Goop sunscreen in SPF 40 and find it amazing.  It is clear, weightless, scentless and oil free.  I have never had a breakout using it.  It always goes on smooth and I never have to worry about my foundation applied on top, balling or pilling or just making a general mess of my face.  With the Skinmedica, I had the same results.  It however is not clear, nor scentless and I did have a few break outs when first using it.  The price of the Skinmedica is $57.80.  The price of the Goop is $28.00.  So the question is, why would I buy a product that works the same, has no other benefits over the other, has less SPF and costs quite a bit more?  The answer is simple.  I will continue to buy the Goop.",1530576000,2018-07-03

It has a refreshing minty-eucalyptus ""Sea-Breeze"" like scent and it feels great going on my skin. Because it doesn't contain alcohol you don't get that extreme tingle/sting like most other toners, but it still feels refreshing.

I highly recommend the toner and although it costs more than a drugstore brand, you only need to use a little of it. Another plus is that it's formulated for men's skin, which is supposed to be thicker and oilier than women's skin, so theoretically the products work better than just the store bought type.",1392681600,2014-02-18

3.0,"I used to have normal/ combination skin which has become drier over time. Therefore, I've progressed to gentler products to wash my face, and have moved to cream-based cleansers for the most part, but which still require water to finish. This product is extremely smooth in texture, is not runny, but not solid- more like a light lotion, and it has a somewhat strong (i could still smell it on my face after it dried), but not unpleasant floral fragrance. The front of the tube says it is a ""One step cleanser sensitive skin 1. Cleaning milk 2. Toner, 3. Eye make-up remover.""  I put this on my unwashed made-up face at the end of the day, as the directions say you can do, and it did glide on very easily. I wiped it off with a pad, and it removed my eye makeup with no problem, and most of my foundation looked to be removed as well. My face felt very moist and soft (not oily), and it dried to ""normal"" skin texture after about two minutes.

After about ten minutes, my face felt a bit sensitive- stinging a bit, and I could still smell the product, so i rinsed my face well with water.

Update- maybe 1/2 hr later:  This maybe an outlier issue, but my face feels warm and red, and now also a bit tingly (not in a good way). i'm going to wash this off with soap, as i guess i'm one of the few that might be having a bad reaction to the cream.

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

4.0,"I've tried many brands of dark circle correctors and had given up finding one that would work. Most left a filmy or tacky look that was worse than the dark circles.

The La Roche-Posay system is different. It combines a quality concealer with gentle eye massage to move the fluid and puffiness away from under the eyes.

The concealer blends cleanly, absorbs quickly, and didn't leave a trace. It noticeably brightened my skin. It's fragrance-free and non-irritating. I wear contact lenses and this did not bother my eyes at all, even when I got a little too close and some got in my eye.

Using the metal applicator to apply the cream worked well, but I found it a little awkward for the massage and ended up using my fingers to gently massage out from the inside of my eye.

After using the cream and eye massage twice a day, morning and evening, I definitely see a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.",1446336000,2015-11-01

4.0,"Quick fix for an uneven and terrible haircut! I received a very bad student haircut that went from medium full to shorter than military with exposed scalp. I stumbled across this stuff on Amazon and bought a competitors as well. This one worked well but was actually enhanced by the other one. This was mostly because the other was a shade different in color and combined created a more natural result. My hair was shorter in one side than the other and the student actually took a 'chunk' out. I looked terrible! This stuff actually created the illusion. Of an even look and concealed my visible scalp while my hair is growing back. It is worth a try! Hair spray makes it stick and once dry will not transfer. Step 1. Shake over your washed, dried, and styled, hair like you are sifting in a back and forth motion. Step 2. Pat gently but firmly into place. Step 3. Wipe any product off your forehead, ears, neck and be prepared to do it again. Step 4. Seal it with a mist of quality hair spray ( you do not need theirs!!). Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine worked great!

Allow to dry or hit it with the hair dryer!
Once dry feel free to shake your head over the sink to prove nothing is coming lose!

You're now good to go! Yes, your hair will feel a little more crunchy than normal,but for me I didn't care. This saved me from a lot of embarrassment and I recommend it to at least try. I don't think it will cover a bald head unless you want to look like you glued hair sprinkles on,

It works really well under powder, too (I use Jane Iredale mineral powder). The color blends very naturally into my fair-complexioned/cool skin tone.

This stuff stays on REALLY well throughout the day. You can tell it's going to last when you really have to scrub your hands with lots of soap and water after applying it just to get it off your hands!

My only concern here is that it ends up on my clothes if I brush against it while wearing - bad for white OR dark colored clothing. So, careful there...

Scent: not much of a scent, but it's not *great*. I'm very sensitive to smells, so I'm glad this isn't perfume-y. But it has a very light, almost chemical-y scent that I'm not a huge fan of. I think most people probably won't even notice it. (I have a VERY sensitive nose..)",1527206400,2018-05-25

My main knock is DermaBlend markets their expensive cover cr&egrave;mes as lasting up to 16 hours....yes, if you let it dry and then cover with setting powder.

I could make the same statement about numerous, far less expensive brands.  It last for hours...if you cover it with our equally expensive setting powder.

I had been thinking about how i missed Loves Lemon fresh from the 70s, as i have a rough time with synthetic fragrances, and Loves didn't trigger respiratory issues and smelled so happy.
About an hour later this Mens cologne appeared in my vine queue. In reading that it was citrusy I decided to give it a try. I haven't found a mens cologne i could handle my husband wearing and hoped this would do the trick.
I sprayed a spritz outside to see if it was going to be overpowering or trigger any negative response.
Passed that test, so spritzed once in house and turned on ceiling fan to disperse.
Still good.
Spritzed husband when he got home. Really liked the citrus top note. Smelled of lime to me. The base notes are subtle at first and have a nice depth and complexity that compliment the citrus.
After about an hour went back and had nice lingering hug with husband, and citrus pretty much gone and remaining scent quite different and surprisingly more intense from the starting point. More musky, soapy, linen like. Not bad, but not what i hoped for.

It has even helped with the godawful eyebrow itching that has been plaguing my every waking moment since springtime showed up with it's attendant hangers-on; pollen and mold.

I'm using this on my hands too and so far, not skin peeling and the itching feeling that was so intense I thought the irritants must be under the skin of my palm has mostly faded away.

Also, and this will be my last also, there is no smell!  I mean it, no fragrance at all.  Nothing to slice into my nostrils like a Star Trek brain burrowing bug to give me a headache, nausea and a mountain meadow odor that will not fade no matter how much I want it to.

The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well.

It's really easy to use and goes on dark so you can see where you're putting it. I recommend, like everyone else, to moisturize first. Apply lightly on ankles, knees, hands and elbows. I had to get my husband to help me with my back, of course. I do this at night, about an hour or 2 before bed. In the morning, take a shower and the color you are left with is just fantastic. I've only had a few issues with streaking, but that's user error.

Right now, as of July this shade is a perfect color and it blends totally easy and in the PM when I remove my makeup I am shocked that it's still on.

I have used a lot of different foundations.  For medium coverage this foundation rocks and perfect for my skin type!",1498867200,2017-07-01
4.0,"This product really does provide epic moisture; it's a very rich, thick cream. I put it on after I shower and there is no need for more lotion the next morning before getting dressed- this stuff stays. It has a luscious fresh lemon scent, rather like lemon custard ice cream. If you have really dry skin this will be great for it.

I did find it a little too thick; it can take some time to get it to spread out and rub in. It doesn't leave a sticky or greasy feeling, though, once you get it rubbed in. The only weird thing about it is when I'd wash my hands after using it, it feels like there is a barrier there that needs to be removed and it takes a bit of soap to get that weird feeling to go away. Oddly, this only happened on my hands; the rest of the skin on my body felt fine when I showered, no feeling like there was a film there. Perhaps it just has time to sink in better (24 hours versus maybe an hour before washing my hands).",1414540800,2014-10-29

Like other Mario Badescu products, the liquid looks thick but feels smooth and non-greasy once you rub it into your skin. The best part is that it has SPF 15, which means I can use this as sunscreen, not just moisturizer. SPF 15 is good for everyday use, when you don't expect to be exposed to a lot of heat and sunshine, but you still want something to protect your face when you go out for work or casual walks.

I appreciate the fact that it doesn't have a strong scent. Except for the price (which I think is a little high for a small bottle), I like the feel of it on my skin.",1473379200,2016-09-09

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

This is the first time I've tried an eye cream by Nuxe, and it is very soothing and gentle.  When I use it after waking up in the morning, I can also tell that it takes away some of the puffyness that I often wake up with because of my allergies.

I also have dark undereye circles, but haven't yet noticed a difference in those.  I'll update this review if I do.

My skin and eyes are sensitive, and this hasn't bothered them at all or caused them to water.

5.0,"The Mia FIT by Clairsonic is a handy little compact device that makes your skin look & feel wonderful!  This was my first time trying a Clairsonic system, & I'm very happy with it. Here's what I love- first, & most important, my skin looks brighter & better than it's been in years. I tend to have dry skin & have had trouble with breakouts, but after using this for over a month, my breakouts have noticeably less. Other things I love about it:
- it's light & compact. Convenient to travel with & doesn't take up a lot of space on my counter.
- Easy to use. Has 2 speeds- push a button to change between the 2.
- USB plug can plug into my computer to charge. That is handy when traveling & a unique feature.
- When using it, the brush is soft & feels great on my face.

When using for the first time, the unit will need to be charged. It says charge for 18 hours at first & that was about how long it took for mine to charge completely.  The system is very easy to use. You just place it on the charger. The unit sits on the charger, & will buzz twice to let you know that it is charging. There is a little faint light on the unit that blinks red while charging, green when fully charged.

I use it in the morning on the #1 setting which is a gentler setting and  #2 setting at night because most of the time I'm removing makeup later in the evening. It makes your face feel fresh & clean.  The only drawback that I could see may be the price, although, when you think about it, if you go for 2 or 3 facials (or maybe even 1, depending on spa/salon), you could easily spend that. This system is an investment in having good skincare year round. I give this an enthusiastic 5 stars, & highly recommend it (especially if you have had issues with breakouts).",1484092800,2017-01-11
5.0,"This is one of the best skincare products I've ever tried. In late 2013 I went for a facial. It was a first-ever manual face treatment that impressed me by an immediate effect. I went back a couple of times and at the beginning of 2014 bought all the products that esthetician used on my face.
Four years later this is only the product I swear by. I'm 38 years old and I don't have any smile lines around my eyes. People tell me that it's impossible that I'm that old. My eyes don't have wrinkles!
Since the age of five, I always had under eye bags and circles. I've tried many skin care products, but nothing was making the difference, except this serum (and Chanel Beauty Initiale - discontinued).

This mousse gives a much better, solid, thick, healthy, groomed look to my eyebrows.  It's much better than using an eyebrow pencil (again, I cannot compare to other mousses since this is my first one).  I put it on, comb eyebrows into place, and it stays forever--until I use water AND rubbing to remove.  This is a ""must have"" product for all day / night eyebrows.  This product really gives a nice frame to my eyes and makes my eyes ""pop.""

I use a skin moisturizer, but I don't have a performance problem with this product staying on.

Also, I use this Dark Brunette even though my eyebrows ""appear to be naturally black.""  The Dark Brunette color looks natural and not like I've smeared on black paint for eyebrows--:).  As an African American, it was important to me that my eyebrows didn't appear ""harsh"" or ""heavy.""

5.0,"This is a strange candle.. Other than its high price point ( at this time ) its instructions state not to light over two hours at a time... I am a candle burner.. I come home, relax, open a bottle of wine and light a candle or two.. Usually for more than two hours more like around four  .. So the idea that this candle should only be burnt for two hours was a little strange but its a high fragrance candle, and the fragrance will probably be overpowering or too strong if lit longer?

I followed the instructions and I guess the instructions are true.. After the timer went off my living room was nicely fragrant with a tea-e flower scent.. Lighting for three hours would be too much, although when I blew the candle out the smell slowly went away..  For the next couple nights I lit the candle again for two hours, and the same effect my living room smells great ..

So my final conclusion is this candle is as intended.. It smells great at the moment, and does fill the room up with a very fragrant unique scent that I would expect to find at a high end retailer or fancy decorated home..  The candle should last for 55 hours, that is almost a month of daily lighting if I want the ambiance this candle creates.  I gave it four stars to start, but realized its a pretty strong smelling candle and although priced high its most likely worth it to the market that can afford it .",1441929600,2015-09-11

5.0,"I'm not much of a bronzer user.  I've tried several over the years with mixed results.  I've never used the gold standard - Guerlain Terra Cotta, because $50 is more than I'm willing to spend on something I'll only use occasionally.  I have tried Physicians Formula, Sephora Sun Disk and Bliss Spa. Since Butter London is a fairly new cosmetics brand that's been popping up in a lot of the better ladies mags, I was eager to give this one a try.

First off, the compact is much larger than I expected.  It measures about 4.5 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, so you get a lot of product for the money.  I did not try the contour shade, but used a combination of the bronzer and highlighter (which is a warm frosty gold) over my forehead, along my cheekbones, nose bridge and chin.  Frankly, I'm amazed at what a lovely, natural looking glow it gave me.  Not dirty looking, nor orange-y in the least.  It really mimics the look of a light tan.  I was really channeling my inner Kardashian with this stuff.

The ""glow pen,"" a small tube that contains a golden liquid with a sponge applicator, looked more like a pale frosted yellow/gold eyeshadow than anything I would use on my face, but at my age, that sort of embellishment tends toward the ridiculous.  I imagine a touch of that on the cheekbones or brow bone of a younger woman would look very glamorous.

3.0,"As a user of the NuFace Trinity electric current facial toning device, I was excited to try their new serums. Included in this set are 3 sample sizes of 3 different serums. Be warned- they are tiny at .25oz each! S1 is the 'Nourisher' designed to moisturize skin and help it absorb the other serums. It features superfruit stemcells. S2 is the 'Smoother' which contains peptides designed to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. S3 is the 'Lifter' which uses Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid to brighten skin and plump it up.

Use: Directions state that you should massage 5 drops of each serum into your face and neck after washing your face. S1 and S2 are supposed to be used twice a day while S3 is used once a day. Personally, I found the products made my skin too oily for makeup application if I used S1 and S2 in the morning so I only used S1-3 at night before going to bed.

Effectiveness: The serums feel wonderful on your skin. It felt very nourished during use and even in the morning after washing my face. My skin seemed more moisturized within a few days of use. When I received the serums, I stopped my former regimen of moisturizer and Vitamin C.  The results from those products (brightened skin and smoothed fine lines) were maintained with the use of NuFace serums. My skin did gain a slightly dewy quality which it did not have before.

Downside: The price of these serums is very high compared to generic products with similar ingredients and the same results. I did not see a difference between these serums and my normal regimen of moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C serum. (Which has a price point of about $25 and lasts 5 months). For this reason, I suspect that S3 is the one that really delivers results since it has almost the same ingredients as my former regimen. I used the serums nightly for close to a month and used about 1/2 of each bottle. This puts the monthly cost at about $37.

The formulation was the real disappointment though as it settled immediately into my lip lines (I'm 33 and don't normally have that problem) and the wear time was a joke.  It was practically gone in two hours without eating or drinking anything.",1400025600,2014-05-14

3.0,"At first I thought I received a defective unit - the instructions say to turn the dial at the bottom to release a small amount of the product. I turned and turned and nothing happened. I was ready to give up, but continued playing with it, and after about 50 (!) turns it worked. Now it works as intended. It clicks when you turn the dial, so you can measure how much product will come out.
Aside from packaging, I like the concealer. There is a little brush, and the liquid is being squeezed from the middle of it. You brush it around your eyes, and then tap with your fingertips to blend at the edges. It conceals unevenness nicely, and looks quite well when applied.
Another little annoyance is when you remove the cap to use the product, you cannot put it on the other end - it is not the right size to attach there.
I am not sure why they called the product ""pixelated"" - don't worry, there weren't any little tiny squares or dots of different color noticeable as the name suggests.",1466380800,2016-06-20

This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.

3.0,"Juice Beauty's Green Apple Hand Cream is nice, but not a favorite.

This is a nice lotion that absorbs well.  I don't feel like my fingers are greasy after applying and I don't need to wipe my hands.  But with a name like Green Apple, I was looking for an apple fragrance.  What I get is more of a sugared lemon.  It's OK, but it doesn't knock my socks off.

Juice beauty says the hand cream will:

- diminish the appearance of dark spots and discoloration
- replenish and deeply hydrate
- brighten the appearance of skin and smooth fine lines
- nourish and hydrate

I don't have discoloration or spots, so I don't know if that aspect works, but I find the hydration effects to be short term and just as good as other lotions I've used in the past.

This is a reasonable hand cream, especially if you like the lemony scent.  It's not my favorite fragrance and I'll try something else next time.",1459900800,2016-04-06

5.0,"*****
This is a high-end luxury brush that truly delivers.

There are two things you need to know when you're ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you'd do better with a larger size.

The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want all nylon, like this Detangler? Even though the Detangler is all nylon, some of the bristles are longer and some are shorter, just like the mixed bristle brush. It's hard to see in the picture. You should know that the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a bristle brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.

The Detangler is a brush just like the other brushes, not something just to be used when your hair is tangled or your done shampooing. It is a fantastic brush for people with coarse hair or long hair or thick hair also. Even though my hair is very short, it is the only brush that works for me because my hair is so thick. This handy size is about eight inches long.

It's quite a large expense to buy any Mason Pearson product compared to other manufacturers of hair care items--it's a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--but it's worth it. If you're the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost. That's how we did it :)

Highly recommended.

4.0,"Overall the Dermablend powder acted much like I expected. I only put it on once a day since I have dry skin and only use it to set my foundation. I have to say, the foundation covered pretty well. Once, I rubbed some over my lips when I was in a hurry to put foundation over my face and my lips disappeared. I looked weird. But unfortunately, the foundation didn't completely cover some brown spots. Really make-up, you make my lips disappear but can't  camouflage brown spots? The powder helped cover the brown spots a bit, but no better than Cover Girl powder. So, I give it a four. Decent powder, but a bit pricey. It does last all day for me, but again, I don't have oily skin.

Here's a trick I use, if the powder is a little too light, which it was for me, you can add cinnamon to darken it. Cinnamon adds a tan color, is inexpensive and good for your skin. I had to add a touch of to this powder to match my skin tone.",1497744000,2017-06-18

2.0,Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!!

A friend recommended this and it has made such a huge difference. I rarely ever have breakouts and my skin is smooth and always fresh feeling. I use this at least 2 times per day (mostly because of how amazing and refreshing it feels). I recently had dry patches of skin around my nose and chapped lips from a very bad cold, and Mario Badescu products helped tremendously.

3.0,"I LOVE the color of Too Taboo but unlike most of the Essie nail polish colors I have tried so far this color started to chip rather quickly. I put on two coats as it does streak a little when applying the first coat, and also Essie's top coat. Within 2 days I noticed one nail was starting to chip and in 3 days another one. I can usually wear most Essie nail polish colors for at least 7 to 9 days with a base and top coat and I put my hands through a lot. The color pictured is not as pink. It is a deeper pinkish color, not quite a plum though. I would wear it for a special occasion but not for the week.

3.0,"As I mentioned in my review of Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua, I mentioned my love of Calvin Klein Euphoria and that is what drove me to choose both Eternity Aqua and Obsession.

Calvin Klein Obsession has been around longer than either Eternity Aqua and Euphoria - since the mid 1980's. It is a guy's scent, but neither my sister nor I are opposed to occasionally wearing men's scents. It's nice not to have all those sweet florals all the time. So for this review, I had my sister help me quite a bit, as she was the primary wearer of the perfume.

My sister first noticed that it was a long-lasting scent that really retained its original smell for almost the entire duration of the perfume. She could smell it several hours after application and not perceive any significant fading later.

The smell itself was a different story. She thought it smelled ""cheap""; it was a pretty straight-forward simple scent primarily composed of musk with very few other notes she could detect. It was not a terrible smell to wear, but it just didn't stand out very much nor did it really ""jive"" with her personality and what she likes in a perfume. She would not be opposed to  wearing it or potentially buying it, but she indicated she would not spend full price on it.

While I didn't wear Obsession to the extent of my sister, I found much of her comments to be the same for me. The scent was nice, but it did not stand out. You didn't go, ""That person is wearing such an expensive, distinct scent!"" Instead, it smelled like a generic men's cologne - pleasant, cinnamon-y and musky, but nothing noteworthy. I suppose this could be because of its age - that so much time has gone by, everyone has tried to imitate Obsession.

This color - sand - worked great. I put just a dab on after moisturizer. The directions tell you to layer the cover stick and I don't know why I hadn't thought of that before, but it does help. Personally, I have to put a little bit of a foundation (really a lightweight BB cream) on top to help blend it in.

3.0,"I should have paid more attention before I ordered this. The key ingredient in this is salicylic acid, which I've never found to be particularly game-changing when it comes to my acne. And at only 1.5%, it's not a very strong salicylic acid either. The first ingredient is water, but the second is dimethicone. Dimethicone is a type of silicone, and creates a layer ontop of the skin that can fill and smooth the look of pores, wrinkles, etc. While this can be a desirable feature in a makeup primer, I find it odd to see in an acne treatment. I also don't really like that the format for delivering the salicylic acid is a ""lotion"". I already apply lotion with SPF on my face everyday, so I don't really want to layer several lotions on my oily/acne prone skin.  If this had SPF in it, then I might consider making it my only lotion, however it does not, and not using SPF isn't an option.

5.0,"It took me some time to find the exact shade for me since I couldn't find it in stock at my local Sephora and my color IQ didn't seem to produce a perfect match.  But once I found the right shade, I really like this foundation.  It's described as medium to full coverage and to me, that's pretty accurate.  I wasn't sure how I would like so much coverage as I've been gravitating towards lighter tinted moisturizers like Laura Mercier or mixing my CoverFX Custom Cover Drops with cream to make a sheer foundation.  Generally lighter foundation has been fine for me since my aging skin means full coverage can sometimes be unflattering and my skin is nice enough that it generally doesn't require a lot of makeup.

But this surprised me.  Even though it covers a great deal, it doesn't accentuate my fine lines and sometimes dry skin and wears well throughout the day.  I've been wearing it when I want a more polished evening look with a full face of makeup and it is perfect for those occasions.  For daytime wear I still prefer something more softer and natural but when I'm going for a bold lip or a smokey eye, this foundation provides me a perfect canvas to start from.

I also think this applies pretty effortlessly.  I've tried my fingers, a foundation brush, and my beauty blender and liked how it looked with all 3.  I also didn't have any trouble taking it off at the end of the night with facial cleaning wipes or my standard face wash.

3.0,"I was in hopes of liking this lotion / moisturizer more.  Unfortunately, its more like applying suntan lotion and does not absorb well.  Its unscented, which is fine, but honestly, I would prefer a little smell.  I use it after using the toner.  If you don't let the toner try first, then its a mess.  But even after the toner dries, it doesnt absorb well. . no matter how long you rub.

4.0,"I used this once before my son who has acne.  I don't have oily skin but I do have rosacea.  This dried my skin out on my cheeks so I gladly handed this off to my son.

He used this for five days and I have noticed the pimples that have come to a head have gone but the hard nodules are still there.  He used this on his back for the acne and it did wonders.  He did have to switch to this every other day as he complained that his cheeks were hot and itchy.  I didn't want to completely abandon this as it has done its' job on the pimples.  So he alternates with this and his old reliable Stridex pads.

Sadly, we won't be buying this again as it is very expensive.  However a little goes a long way so he'll have this for several weeks.",1485129600,2017-01-23

3.0,"3.5 stars - I used it on my 2nd pregnancy hoping to reduce the effects of stretch marks. It helps with the itching on my skin as it stretches, however, I don't think it had much effect on the stretch marks at all. I found the scent to be too strong for me. I was really sensitive to scents earlier on in my pregnancy and this lotion used to make me nauseous. It got better as I became less sensitive to the smell in the third trimester. I would have preferred all pregnancy products to be unscented. Also had a problem with the tube design. The cap always caused the lotion splatter when opened.",1506816000,2017-10-01
5.0,"I originally snapped this up for my husband, as I was fond of the listed notes, the grapefruit in particular is a favorite. But our teenager is in a phase of wanting to smell nice so I let him have first dibs and I have to say that I'm glad I let him have it. While I like it and my teen does, I don't think my husband would care for it as much.

You definitely get the tuberose notes and this fragrance which gives it a really warm overall feel. It's very bright and clean at first but as the grapefruit burns off I find it's a bit sensual and I'd even dare say it's almost unisex. I tried it on myself and though I wouldn't wear it, I found it was a flattering scent even on me. (Ladies if you love sneaking a spritz of your guys' scent this is a great one).

If you like Ralph Lauren's Romance or Jean Paul Gautier Le Male I would definitely check out Lacoste Ea de Lacosta. I think this is a terrific choice for men in their late 20's and into the late 30's, it's very grown-up and established feeling but not so mature that it feels like a dad cologne.",1423526400,2015-02-10
4.0,"This is a nice eyeliner, it has a waxy formula that goes on smoothly and blends easily.  It is pretty similar to my go-to eyeliner which is the NYX 'slide on, glide on, stay on' liner.

This is not to say that some users might not see improvement in fine lines since several reviewers said they did.

The lotion has the faintest of scents and isn't annoying, it goes on very smooth and only takes a couple of pumps from the applicator- a good thing since the small container is currently listed at $95.",1474156800,2016-09-18
5.0,"With three women, teens and adult, in the house we go through make-up quickly. And it disappears, if you know what I mean. So I was excited to try this one.

This is a nice pencil. One side has the liner and the other side has a smudger for giving your eyes a smokey look. Use was easy as the eyeliner went on smoothly. Using the smudger was also easy once you figure out how to use it correctly. Here's a hint: not to much!

Since we care about trying to be organic and all natural about stuff we put in us and on us in our family I also like that several ingredients are organic and I didn't see the heavy chemicals I see in normal off the shelf stuff. A plus.

For my finally, we will be looking at this brand going forward.",1415923200,2014-11-14
5.0,"A delightfully light scent that reminds me very much of one of my all-time favorite scents: Fragonard Soleil Eau d' Parfum, which has proven to be tough to find at times. The scent is not heavy and one I can easily enjoy wearing daily due to its subtleties. It appeals to my mother who is in her 70's and my daughter who is in her teens, making me think it may also be a scent that would work for all ages of women who like a light, not overly floral scent.

While I would feel comfortable wearing this in any season, Weekend for Women reminds me a bit of spring or summer more than fall or winter; which I associate with musk and sandalwood scents.

The product description:

""Weekend for Women is a feminine fragrance with a contemporary, refreshing, citrusy tone. A sheer fragrance with top notes of tangerine, tree sap and reseda plant. Delicate floral heart notes of wild rose, peach blossom, iris and hyacinth, invigorated by a subtle splash of nectarine. The low notes of cedar wood and sandalwood add depth for a relaxed and fresh scent.""

I really like this one, and look forward to wearing it often. Highly recommend it!",1445558400,2015-10-23
4.0,"There are some folks out there who really dislike this product. I am not one of them.

This product looks and feels like water. It goes on as water would. Moisture is a ""manicure killer"". The sole purpose of this product is to dehydrate the nail bed before you apply any polish. ""Chip-Skip"" was formulated to combat moisture on your nails so that you have the driest possible surface on which to apply your polish - in theory, making your polish last longer.

I use two ""coats"" of Chip-Skip (just to make sure that I covered each nail well) before I apply a base coat, and it is my experience that, when understood and used correctly,Chip-SKip does its job and helps retain the polish on your nails. It increases the length of time that my polish lasts.

There are so many variables to making polish last longer that it may be difficult to understand the difference that this product makes at first. It will depend on the formula of the polishes that you are using, the amount of water that you may get your hands into ( I always use rubber gloves when I am using water!). I can see how some people discount this product. It's difficult to quantify.

The other day I had rubber gloves on for a few hours as I worked on an art project. I had just done my nails the day before. Wearing the rubber gloves did the opposite that they are intended to do. Holding the moisture in on my hands for that long caused my polish to being to chip and lift as soon as I removed the gloves. Lesson learned. Too  much of a good thing can be bad!

I am satisfied that this product works. I have used it over time and with many different brands. It's not a miracle by any means, but it does help.",1404604800,2014-07-06

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.

This wash leaves your skin feeling very smooth, and doesn't leave a ""tacky"" residue like you might experience from even a nice soap. Although this stuff costs quite a bit more than many similar products, it is worth every penny.

A word of advise - skip the 10oz and go for the $50 33oz bottle. It will last you several months and is a much better value than the smaller tube. After you run out of this you will definitely want to re-up anyway.",1357171200,2013-01-03

4.0,"THis is a neat product, but a steep learning curve for me.  You actually are making little fibers with your hands to apply into your hair. This gives your hair a sort of extra strength bonding to hold up any styling you want to do. For me, I wanted to just raise my roots for volume on top. It worked well, once I got the hang of it.

At first I used too much, the second time I used it after I had used some dry shampoo which just made a terrible mess together. It takes a bit of doing as once you put it into your hair, there's really no going back.  I'm sure it would hold some wild styles and shapes if you wanted.  For me, just the root lift is enough.

But figure on using a lot to get used to it.",1504396800,2017-09-03
4.0,"I was surprised at the size of the tub.  This is a huge container unlike most creams on the market.  It has 10 oz in here.  This is good because it costs approx $100.  It is a thick cream but not much is needed.  A small amount will melt on the skin.  Unfortunately, this is not an overnight miracle so whether or not it actually will improve my (very) crepe-y neck remains to be seen.  I have taken several photos and will compare them in a week, 2 weeks and a month.  I will also update the review how long it lasts. Somebody said the cream is greasy.  I don't agree with that if a small amount is used.  I'm using it on my neck which is very dry.  Perhaps the reviewers who report too much shine don't have dry skin like me.  I don't use this on the face since I have Rosecea and very sensitive skin.  I only use it on the throat.

Update October 9, 2016. I've stopped using it because it made my rosecea worse and I gave it to my mom who seems to like it. She is 94 and convinced she has too many wrinkles; she doesn't but she likes it a lot and it seems to soften her skin.

Good:
Large size (10 oz)
OK-Aroma; I didn't mind it
Thick cream which goes on smoothly and spreads well
Only a very small amount is needed
Contains natural ingredients

Not so good:
The only negative so far has been the name.  Not very inviting!  Who wants to admit you have crepe-y skin?  Not sure what else I would have called it but not that.
I realize that folks think it's too expensive but my goodness, it's 10 ounces!!  Look at the bottles at the department store counters and see how little is in them.  I don't think this is overpriced but it might just be too expensive for many in spite of how much is in there.",1458950400,2016-03-26

This is a foaming cleanser with a pleasant scent, but would be healthier without fragrance. Neither of us find this cleanser irritating to our skin. This cleanser is too drying for my skin, but its not meant for my dry skin type. Its good for my teens skin and leaves his skin feeling clean, refreshed and not too dry or too oily. His acne and overall complexion happen to look calm and nice lately. While I cant say its due to this cleanser, it certainly hasn't caused any irritation or breakouts.

I don't like that this Bioderma Sebium cleanser has sodium laurel sulfate (SLS) as it strips the skins protective barrier and over time will cause increased oil production to compensate. It also has fragrance and other chemicals. This cleanser does seem to be working well for my teen right now, but I don't know the long run effects and think its best to switch off with a cleanser without SLS.

3.0,"I bought 4 colors of nail polish and 1 bottle of the topcoat, each for about $11.
While I know that's not the most expensive nail polish out there--it is a lot more than I usually pay.

I have used the polish three times and have been less than blown-away by it. I have used the Serene Green on my toes and it has held up pretty well. However, the Electric Orange I have used twice on my fingernails has two problems: the color is sheer enough that I don't feel two coats gives enough coverage (you still see streaks through to my nail) and it has chipped or worn off the end of the nail within a couple of days. So the 5-7 days touted has just not been my experience. The polish seems to chip or wear off much less than normal polish but, still. My expectations were higher for this product.

One thing I did find out is that the first 2 coats of color seem to stay a bit sticky--I tried letting them dry for several minutes to an hour--but as soon as I put the topcoat on, it dried pretty hard after about 10 minutes. So the topcoat is important and it seems to ""dry"" the first coats very well.",1373587200,2013-07-12

For everyone else, I like a nice uncomplicated smell.  Fresh, clean, just out from the shower, is the perfect scent.  Then they always mess it up by getting all sweaty  nice, sometimes, but mostly, not.

It is hard to convince a teenager he should not smell like a womens magazine, especially when all his friends seems to be dipping their heads in one.

5.0,"The jane iredale compact comes with 5 shadows that in my opinion will suit most of your eye needs. The palette is neutral and the colors warm (brown/mauve family  feather, lace, chenille, satin and velvet). You can play with blending and applying different styles. The shadows last most of the day and can be removed easily. The compact is pretty, rose colored and mirrored. Inside is a nice sized mirror, although I tend to use my bathroom mirror when applying all of my makeup, and a nice long applicator, which makes it easy to apply the shadow. The shadows themselves seem quality. The only reason that I hesitate to give this product 5 stars (and instead give it 4.5) is because I do think it is a little pricey for the average consumer (about $60).",1506211200,2017-09-24

Her hair is noticeably less frizzy and has a nice shine. It also adds volume and definition to her curls without crunch or crust. It is very lightweight and doesn't weigh her hair down. She uses it as a leave-in conditioner on her damp hair and also uses her usual styling products afterwards. It is a great product but pricey.,1476576000,2016-10-16

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19
4.0,"I wasn't sure what to think about using an oil for cleansing.  There were several different options written on the bottle as far as possible uses, so I first went with - as a makeup remover.  This worked well, it took off most of my make up and didn't cause any issues around my eyes.  But rinsing it off was difficult and I felt very greasy before going to bed when compared with my normal makeup remover.

So I started using this before taking my shower in the morning.  Two pumps into my hand, step in the shower and rub it all over my face (in tiny circles as described on the bottle).  This actually worked.  It seems to get off any residual makeup from the day before and leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized by the time I get out of the shower.  I have been doing this for a week now and have not had any new massive breakouts. That was what had worried me because even though my skin is dry, any added oil tends to break me out.

I haven't seen any over all change in my skin, other then it being less dry after my morning shower.  If I see any difference after finishing the bottle I will update.  Though I like this, I do think that the current asking price is a bit more than I would be comfortable spending - but we will see.",1415404800,2014-11-08

Although I still have some melasma, it was able to eliminate 80% of it when used day and night all over my face.  I spent a few thousand dollars on laser and only $200 on Obagi and love the results.

It can almost double as a clutch (except for the ""ooh la la"" in light gold on the outside).  I stored everything from my old makeup bag into this one and added some more just to see how much I can put in it and still have it zip up: 2 eyebrow pencils, 2 eyeliners, 3 concealers, small mineral powder, small sunscreen, 2 lip balm sticks, compact mirror, small comb, allergy pills, tissue packet, 2 lip glosses, 2 lipliners, blush, 1 blush brush, 1 concealer brush, Listerine pocket strips, allergy eyedrops.  And I have room for more. The bag isn't as bulky when filled as you would think. It lies flatter than my other bag because of its shape and fits much better in my purse.

My one caveat is that because it is such a high quality material and expensive, that I am afraid of what to do about stains. I have never had a makeup bag that did not pick up an errant lipstick or blush or pencil stain at some point and I would hate for this beautiful bag to get dirty.

The problem is that you need to keep applying it under they eye area several times a day to really get the benefit from it.  I have used several other under-eye creams and this one just does not do what it promises to do.

The skin around the eyes is the thinnest on the face and can be most prone to damage and showing the sign of aging. When applying tthe cream carefully under the eye, using the ring finger because it has the lightest touch, you are less likely to harm the delicate area.  After a month of using the cream and following the recommendations, I can say that I saw absolutely no visible reduction of lines under and around  my eyes.  As someone who is over the age of  40, having an emollient rich under eye cream is important to me - especially during colder winter months when the skin requires more moisture.",1447977600,2015-11-20

Well, I can't say it gave me happy face afterall. Don't get me wrong- it's a perfectly usable and decent face cream and made my skin feel lovely. But lightweight and cooling? I can't go that far. The consistency is gel-like (hence the name) more than a heavy cream but when it dries it seems a little stiff.

I was happy that the fragrance was pleasant enough and my overly sensitive skin accepted it without complaint. It also is non- sticky which is great under regular foundation- as long as you aren't planning to be baking in the humid heat. So, use it for better skin but don't expect a cooling miracle.",1471305600,2016-08-16

5.0,"I hate the messy spray dry shampoos.  I've tried about 6 different ones, high end and drugstore, and all of them have left a disturbing grayish cast in my dark blond hair.  But this dry shampoo is a sprinkle in powder that works incredibly well. I use the tiniest amount of this powder and it soaks up oil really well but it does take a few minutes to work.  At first the scent is strong but it soon disappears so if you're fragrance sensitive, you'll definitely be able to use Pronto.  It makes my hair look and feel much cleaner and it doesn't give me that flat matte finish like so many dry shampoos.  The small size is deceiving because it takes very little powder to do the job and I'll bet there's not much actual powder in the sprays and that all the room in the can is taken up by nasty propellant.  So this product is not expensive to use at all.  I've had the 1 ounce size for several months, even though I use it a couple of times a week.  It also comes in a larger size, which is more economical.  I know that Ulta carries Pronto and if you buy it there, you can return it if you don't like it.  However, I'm willing to bet that you'll like it as much as I do.  I definitely prefer the sprinkle in powder form over the sprays.  Today, for example, I used Pronto and after 20 minutes there was no residue left.  I just worked it in like regular shampoo and POOF!, 20 minutes later it had disappeared.  I had some nice volume and my hair still had shine.  I really like everything about this product and will keep it stocked from now on.  It's by far the best dry shampoo I've tried and I see no need to keep looking.  If you want cleaner looking hair without having to shampoo, I suggest you try this product.  I definitely recommend it.",1448323200,2015-11-24

5.0,"I have transitioned almost exclusively to Vichy skin-care products over the last year. I have been very satisfied with all of them and was looking forward to trying a new mask. I have been alternating between the peachy gel mask and the clay mask for the oily T zone.  What a clever idea to use all three at once for combination skin! However, because of their different consistency, the only way Ive found that this works well is to apply all three on the required zones, leave for about five minutes, then wash off with a washcloth.

 The mineral mask is a clear gel with a faint jasmine scent. The ingredients are:

AQUA GLYCER I N  ALCOHOL DENAT. NIACINAMIDE  DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL PENTYLENE GLYCOL  BUTYLENE GLYCOL PEG-8  PEG/PPG/POLYBUTYLENEGLYCOL-8/5/3 GLYCERIN  PEG-60HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL  CI 61570  CARBOMER  TRIETHANOLAMINE PHENOXYETHANOL  AMMONIUMPOLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE  TETRASODIUM EDTA MENTHOXYPROP DIOLT-BUTYLALCOHO L PARFUMCODE F.I.L. : C182661/1

The quenching mineral mask has sort of conflicting instructions.  They say apply for five minutes then massage the excess in or remove with a cotton ball. This just doesnt work for me. I don't know how to describe the consistency, after five minutes, except to say it is sort of like rubber cement. Youre not massaging it anywhere. Ive found what works best for me is to clean my face with a transparent soap and apply a thin coat of the mask. I just leave it on overnight and in the morning my face is very soft and smooth with fewer fine wrinkles. It takes about two hours for it to absorb into my skin and stop being sticky.

So my beard grew only about a little over an inch by the time I started using this. Usually my beard grows thick and curly in the summer, and this time it was thick and stubby with a little curl forming at the ends. I applied this as directed and was rushed by the pleasant smell. I usually let it sit for an hour before the results fully kick in, and do they ever. Even at the less-than-inch beard I have I can tell that my hairs are far softer and less churlish to the touch.

It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17
5.0,"Our toddler grandson has been lucky as far as diaper rash woes go. We seem to have found the right combination when it comes to his diapers and wipes, and likely his diet may play a part in his mostly rash-free experience. Nevertheless, there have been occasions where he's had issues, and they have been painful and horrendous, as any amount of irritation goes for a little one. I can't emphasize enough how this Mustela cream has virtually erased these rashes, most of the time within one or two applications.

That said, we've indulged many premium brands of baby skin care, including some rash remedies that are twice the price of the Mustela. We have always purchased products which are fragrance-free, with as few ""unnatural"" ingredients as possible. The Mustela label claims 98% of the rash cream ingredients are of natural origin, leaving a mere 2% of ingredients in question. In this case, we are fine with that and grateful for the cream's superb effectiveness.

It's stressful for everyone when your child is suffering in pain. This stuff works wonders and has wiped out every occasional rash on my grandson. If your child suffers with more chronic rashes, I'm willing to bet this would be an effective preventative. Highly recommended!",1492560000,2017-04-19
5.0,"I am a man who will soon be turning fifty-three.  During the past year, my skin has become dry, irritated and red.  To my chagrin, I had to stop using an electric shaver; this helped but I still had some patches of dry skin in areas where I didn't shave, primarily around my left eyebrow.  In order to relieve the situation, I had to shave every other day and only wash my face in the morning and never at night.  Every morning, I used an exfoliator that was designed to be gentle (NIVEA Men Sensitive Face Wash).  Still, I had to use a lot of Cetaphil in order to relieve my dry skin.

  When the Amazon Vine Program offered me the Mario Badescu Seaweed Cleansing Soap, I jumped at the opportunity to try it.  It has noticeably improved the feel and texture of my skin.  I have returned to shaving every day and to washing my face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night before going to bed.  In fact, I feel confident that I could wash it more often as needed.  I squeeze a tiny smear of the greenish, speckled cream onto the palm of my left hand and use my right fingers to smear it onto my face.  I gently rub it into my skin.  The seaweed cleansing soap has a pleasant smell that is barely noticeable.  It is not strong and abrasive like liquid aftershave.

  The soap is easily washed off.  It does not sting my flesh like some exfoliators have done.  My skin is left feeling moist, not dry and irritated.  According to the packaging, this soap is designed for ALL skin types.  The plastic bottles appearance is neither feminine nor masculine.  It is what I call gender friendly.  However, there wasn't any safety seal beneath the old-fashioned screw on cap.  It is difficult to rub a small amount into the palm of my hand.  It would have been better if the cap had a spout that lies flat with the top of the bottle.  You lift up the spout and squeeze out a small dollop of the cream.

  Overall, I really like the seaweed cleansing soap from Mario Badescu Skincare.  It thoroughly cleans my skin, giving it a healthy glow, without dehydrating it.  I relish the creamy texture, color and scent of the cleanser.  It easily washes off my face.  The bottle is small enough to carry in a backpack, purse, shoulder bag, tote bag, etc.  Therefore, it is conducive for traveling.  After using the product for nearly a week, I haven't experienced any adverse side effects.  I highly recommend this seaweed cleansing soap.  It would make a thoughtful present for someone with a troubled complexion.",1473292800,2016-09-08

4.0,"I really like this. My eyes are red under and on top. This is the perfect color to cover and make around my eyes look brighter but not white. It goes on smooth with a paint brush and is easy to blend in. Eye-shadow went on well over it and so did the eyeliner. It was just the perfect color for me and didn't gather in my crows feet or run when my eyes water.
Update after using it for awhile I'm not very happy with the brush applicator. The brush gets hard and crusty and it hurts to push it against the sensitive skin under my eye. The cream comes up through the middle of the paint brush applicator and I never know till it is too late how much I am pushing out! This is a waist as I use very little and then it gets crusty after a couple days. Very happy still with everything.",1492473600,2017-04-18

3.0,"I got this product for my wife and her review is as follows. I'm in my early thirties, but my two kids are sucking the pretty out of me, so I thought I would try adding some kind of anti-aging product to my skin care regime. I have been using this serum daily, sometimes twice daily, for the last  couple of weeks. It feels just like a moisturizer or something going on, but perhaps lighter. At such a high price, I can't imagine putting this all over your neck and ""decolete"" everyday but I guess if you have wrinkles there, it might be worth it. I can feel it doing something to my skin after I apply it- just a slight warmth on my skin that goes away quickly. I follow this serum with some moisturizer of a different brand.

I can't say that I'm noticing any results as of yet and at $75 an ounce I was hoping for more. My skin might look a little more ""luminous"" and maybe it feels a little better, but I still look like I need a nap most of the time (which I do). Maybe some of the little wrinkles are looking less deep. I'll continue using it as perhaps the improvements are yet to come and if that happens I will update my review accordingly.

I definitely like the idea of organic and natural ingredients in a product like this, so I think this is certainly a better choice than a chemical laden facial cream. And it is mostly likely just as effective as a less natural product. I am skeptical of the anti-aging products, so I'll be pleasantly surprised if it actually does something good for my skin. So far, it sure isn't doing any harm, but I'm not looking much more luminous or young.",1416009600,2014-11-15

1.0,It still dries your skin out. It says to remove with tissue and not to scrub. If you don't scrub you can't remove it. When you scrub it shreds the tissue and leaves the tissue in balls all over your face. It feels totally gunky.,1357516800,2013-01-07
3.0,"This body lotion has dimethicone, olive oil, glycerine, coconut oil, shea butter and cocoa butter and several flower and herb extracts in its composition. Given the relatively lower cost compared to many skin hydration lotions from prestige brands I find it to be a ok for the price. Skin hydration and repair is a constant process anyway, and one has to keep at it every day and also take vitamins and drink lots of water or even the best cream does nothing.

So Crepe Erase is working for me and I am using it on my arms and neck. So far so good. It works nicely in the Spring season when it's still cold enough for skin to get dry. I tried using it for my face but it burned really badly, maybe due to higher alcohol content. I don't have very sensitive skin and typically I can apply most body and hand lotions to my face. But not this one, it stings! So I am giving it 3 stars, if it was relatively less irritating on my face and around my eyes, I would rate it higher.",1458432000,2016-03-20

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

5.0,"I am a big fan of facial washes and was eager to try this product.

So far this one has been a winner. One of the things I noticed right away was that the directions and ingredients were easy to read. A lot of these skin care products are made for middle-aged and older customers, and it's frustrating when the print is too tiny to read. That's not a problem here.

The scent is subtle and pleasant. Not too flowery or sweet.

I used a small amount on my face, neck, and chest and loved the way it made my skin feel. According to the instructions, you are supposed to ""gently massage with fingertips for 1 to 2 minutes"" and then rinse. Again, I used only a small amount, and it was more than enough, so the 6 oz. container should last a long time.

This product offers a low-maintenance to keep my skin clean and healthy, and I highly recommend it.",1458000000,2016-03-15

A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load.

The fragrance comes on strong and masculine but fades down to a pleasant scent. I have longer hair that's full already, so this clay didn't hold quite as well as I'd like, but I imagine if you have shorter hair, it'd be perfect.  I live in a southern climate with high humidity, so I usually use a really powerful gel.

It feels waxy to the touch, but I moistened my hands, put a dab of product in the palm, rubbed my hands together to mix and warm up, and was able to spread it more evenly in my hair that way. Once I blew my hair dry, it took away the waxy feel and made it soft.

Sadly, in my opinion, it is not anywhere near as effective as Effaclar. Within about a week of using this cleanser, my pores began to enlarge and I developed blackheads; something I haven't dealt with in fifteen years or so. Additionally, it doesn't remove makeup from my skin very well at all. With my previous cleanser, two pumps onto a washcloth provided excellent lather and my skin was clean and soft afterwards. To get the same amount of lather from this cleanser it takes about four pumps - instead of two - and it still doesn't remove all traces of my foundation. I always use toner after cleansing, and after using this product, the cotton ball with the toner applied comes away with makeup on it. After cleansing with Effaclar, no traces of my foundation remain. So, I guess I will be going back to my Effaclar.",1526428800,2018-05-16

4.0,"The 39C razor has become an important part of my shaving repertoire. My sense is that it is at its best doing what I term as ""maintenance shaves"". That is, one or two passes in order to get to an acceptable level of closeness. On very thorough shaves, it can become a bit aggressive. Every time I've done a third facial pass, I have found that I regretted it afterward. Not because I have actually cut myself, but because I have felt that I've put more wear and tear on my face than was warranted.

My experience indicates that a moderate blade works best here, one that splits the difference between smoothness and sharpness. My go-to for the 39C is the Personna Lab Blue. The Wilkinson Sword worked great for the first pass, but was really prone to getting a bit too aggressive on subsequent passes. Of course, your results may vary.

What this razor excels at is the first pass. None of my other DE razors take as much hair off, as easily, as the 39C. If your preference is to simply do a quick shave every day, and you're not looking for a baby smooth result. This is your machine. I wouldn't recommend it as a first DE razor, but that' simply because a slant head is always going to take a more gentle hand, and it could really cut you up if you couldn't find the angle. No, for a first razor, I would say a closed comb, mild model like the 34C would be the better choice.",1451520000,2015-12-31

This is the first time I have tried the Jack Black Shampoo and Conditioner (previously used the shampoo and than a separate conditioner).  I feel that the normal Jack Black is my favorite of the 3 shampoos mentioned above but that this one is not in my opinion as good as using the normal shampoo and than the normal conditioner which I know from experience makes my hair feel squeaky clean.  This version merely makes my hair feel clean but not super clean that I get after I typically add conditioner.  It is easy to get sudsy and it washes out of my hair no problems and my normally dry hair does not feel as dry as it does after using the Anthony's brand.  I dislike the pump and wish they would go back to the old bottle (with that being said I also liked the blue bottles better than the new green that they switched over to for their product line).

3.0,"This lotion smells great - almost good enough to eat! But while it may be one of the best-selling lotions I have come across, I have to say that it feels more greasy than a lot of lotions when I first put it on. It eventually dries into the skin and loses its readiness, but - initially - it is quite greasy going on.
As for its effectiveness in relieving dry skin, I'd give it a four out of five. I have been putting it on my hands and feet right before bed and I can see that it is doing the job pretty well when I look at my hands and feet in the morning.
The single biggest factor contributing to my three star rating is the high price tag. For such a small tube of lotion, $20 seems pretty excessive. I don't see anything about it that justifies such a high price, so it's hard for me to give it a strong recommendation, even if it does work. There are plenty of other lotions on the market that do the job just as well but come in larger bottles and with smaller price tags.",1455408000,2016-02-14

3.0,"I evaluate skin care products based on multiple factors including the degree of improvement, value (cost vs. volume), usability, and side effects. I realize that each person's skin is different so my experience will be a highly subjective one. I am 51, so I'm likely a good candidate for this type of product as I have wrinkles, darkening and eye bags. My skin is fair and thin, but I don't suffer from dryness, oily skin, or blemishes - only the advances of age. At over $53 for .5 oz, this has a very high bar to clear in terms of value.

In order to assess more clearly what the effects of use would be, I took before and after shots of my eyes. Though I did see improvement for myself without the pictures, I didn't want to rely entirely on a subjective assessment and memory. There is definite improvement in terms of reducing eye bags/puffiness, dark circles, and lifting of the eyelids. It does live up to its promises, but I think it's the sort of improvement that only the user is going to notice. If you look at the picture I'm including with this review, you can see the bottom is somewhat improved over the top after using this product.

In terms of usability, I give the manufacturer props for making dispensing tiny amounts so easy. The hole in the tube's nozzle is very tiny so you can squeeze out just enough. The cream is thick and I'm sorry to say that my eyes felt quite itchy after using it. This settled down some as time went by (after about 15 minutes), but I experienced moderate itchiness for quite some time. This is likely just a reaction with my skin type and others may not experience similar problems.

This is a good eye cream, but it is very expensive and does not have a transforming effect for the price tag. You would have to have a lot of money to spend on modest results for this to be worthwhile. I've experienced similar results with products which offered more value and less irritation.",1445990400,2015-10-28
3.0,"I use Lancome's liquid foundation followed by their compact, but I was really wanting something to help set my makeup a little better and control shine, etc...

This simply didn't do the job.  First off, my major issue is the design. I use a Kabuki brush for my face and the design of the holes is SO Wal-mart grade makeup... it just is painful to get a proper amount on your brush and not make a mess.  That's my major issue with this one.  So naturally you end up using too little or too much, and once you shake off too much into the top area it's stuck there, there's no getting it back into the bottom.

As far as setting powder, it works, it just doesn't help with shine at all and honestly I saw no difference between this and using my more ""compact"" type foundation as a setting powder instead.  I would suggest using something along those lines with a Kabuki brush, it's easier to control the amount and still does the same thing.",1499731200,2017-07-11

5.0,"This is one of the best grooming kits Ive ever used. When you first open the kit you will see the Zwilling J.A. Henckels quality in the leather carrying case. The case has small pockets inside that are designed to hold each tool in its designated location. The quality doesnt stop at the case it continues to each of the 5 tools in the kit.

My only problem with the Zwilling J.A. Henckels grooming kit is the nail clipper. The slim folding nail clipper is a little complicated to figure out. You need to press down a little on the top and pull back than push forward to unfold the clippers. Once unfolded the nail clippers work really well.

A week and a half later, I was sad to see it go.  I will definitely shellac my nails in this color again, but only in summer when I'm feeling young and flirty.

The certified organic seal and the cruelty free declaration builds my confidence in the company's products.  Apply the moisturizer and blend into skin as directed otherwise it will take a few minutes to soak in.  Dermatologists recommend using a sun screen separate from beauty products to make sure that you apply enough sun screen so the fact that this has no sunscreen is a plus, I use a separate beauty sunsreen.

3.0,"This product is leaps and bounds above it's other price-range curling irons - it gets very hot relatively quickly and is pretty easy to use.

Unfortunately you do get what you pay for (and I was ripped off paying $45 at the beauty store for it.)  After about 2 days of use, there was a short in the rotating cord and if the iron is held at an odd angle, it turned off.  It was still usable, but I had to modify the way I curled my hair to avoid it turning off and losing heat.  After about 6 months, you can see the ceramic coating chipping off a little - and I used the iron about 3-4x per month.

If you're in the market for a cheap curling iron - I would suggest this because compared to the Revlon, Remington and Conair brands I've had in the past, this is the closest to a high end curling iron among them - most likely you will have better luck with your iron than I did.",1205452800,2008-03-14
3.0,"I applied this to my face and neck. Since there are no directions on the package and it is not really a cream, I avoided my eyelids. This serum has a very strong fresh scent, goes on smoothly, and did not leave my face tacky. It left my face extremely hydrated even up to 18 hours. The box says up to 48 hours but I wash my face before then. However, i do not like the consistency of the serum. It is a very liquid type cream.

This product is made in France but most of the writing on the package appears to be in Russian.  I don't like is that there are no directions for use on the package.

As long as I have enough aloe gel, I really don't feel any of the micro current. When I do feel it, it's not overly uncomfortable, just noticeable.
Best of all...IT WORKS! Hang in there, give it a week or so of consistent use. I was disappointed at first since I didn't see an immediate difference as I had read could be possible. But, after using it for 5 days, in a row, I could definitely see a difference. What pleased me the most was the furrow between my brows lessened dramatically! That alone was enough to keep me using this.

Ive even used this product in the shower with my Clarisonic, and while it doesnt foam it does make my skin feel clean and so soft after without feeling greasy.

3.0,"This delivers a very fine, fine mist.  It is in a aerosol type spray, and though it is loaded with chemicals, I really thought from the quality of the spray delivery that I would love it.  It has a bit of an odor, but it is more like chemicals and alcohol than perfume.  It quickly goes away, because this product dries quickly

It does not cause cosmetics to run or change color, and powder looks more natural.

It holds makeup on well for 3-4 hours.  After 3 hours my face feels stiff and dry with this product. I can't stand it much longer myself so I remove it.  It comes off with a soap based cleanser or Olay makeup remover towelettes.  It leaves my face dry though, even in this humid, muggy weather.

I can't recommend it if needed for more than about 3 hours.  It does prolong makeup wear on hot, sweaty days for a couple of hours,  so it might work well for a photo shoot or short special event.  I would never wear it daily.",1468886400,2016-07-19

The product uses chinese herbs and natural extracts such as: ginseng, watercrest, Sumac, rose oil, nobilis oil and many others.  6 oz bottle can go a long way.  This is professional product and it can be purchased at salons that use Bioelements line.  It prepares skin for mosturizer and I use it at day and night.  It works as a mist and instead of using cotton puffs/pads, I apply paper tissues and gently dab it on my skin to remove any access and help absorbtion.

2.0,"In the past, I have used Juice Beauty's moisturizer and was so pleased with it I thought ordering this acne set for my teenager would be a no-brainer. Boy, was I wrong!

 First, I must address the odor issue. The face wash and acne clearing serum smelled absolutely rancid.  When we first opened the acne clearing serum tube, the content came squirting and losing out. The serum was very liquidy, like water with smelly brown grains.  It looked like  puddle water and smelled like pond scum.  I immediately checked the date on the box, but we weren't near expiration.  I don't think the serum should have had the consistency our tube had.

 My son decided to try it despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.

5.0,"I've never been particularly impressed by the electric shavers I've used in the past. They never seemed to give me a close enough shave and would leave my legs feeling prickly even after multiple passes. I'm pleased to report that the LumaRx shaver gives me a close enough shave that it's nearly indistinguishable from a regular multi-blade razor shave.

This shaver is wet/dry, so you can use it in the shower (but do not submerge it in water or use it in the bath!). I personally prefer using it dry, though, but that's mostly because my bathroom can be rather cold, and the shaver is not terribly comfortable going over goosebumps. But it runs smoothly over my legs and gave a close shave after one or two passes. It was a bit uncomfortable on my armpits, but my skin there is rather sensitive and would need to get used to an electric shaver.

You should charge this shaver for 24 hours before first use and continue to charge it as the instructions say after you use it. A single charge allows for 30 minutes of shaving, which can last multiple days. The shaver opens up easily for cleaning, and you can rinse it out, which is a nice bonus for cleaning. I haven't used the trimmer attachment yet, but I'll update my review once I do.

Overall? This is a really great electric shaver. I may be converted when it comes to shaving my legs.",1459728000,2016-04-04

I'm so use to using similar looking face washes it was just second nature to use it that way but this is strictly a makeup remover. Just use a little on a cotton pad and makeup comes right off, no rinsing necessary and it leaves your skin feeling soft and clean. This is a clear gel, no beads or color in it like I expected. It has a very light floral, slightly rose scent that quickly dissipates. Not sure I would give up my 7 dollar Neutrogena face wash for this, which works just as well and is way cheaper but if you just want a makeup remover, not a wash, this does do the job with ease.",1483315200,2017-01-02

3.0,"This perfume has light, fresh overtones, but it also has a definite musky heart.  The airy breeziness of the topnotes is definitely the most euphoric thing about this scent.  On me, however, it dries down into a rather musky fragrance, something that is not especially euphoric, and something that I don't particularly like.  My skin tends to amplify the musks in perfumes, and that's absolutely the case here.  I've also used the original Euphoria perfume, and I do prefer Endless Euphoria to the original.  I find that Endless Euphoria is lighter, and maintains its floral notes better than the original.

4.0,"I admit that I was a little leery to try this because of the comment about a 'tint', but I think that's just because this belongs to a line of products that do provide a tint and this is the final part that helps to set the makeup. I do have a setting spray (a primer and setting spray from Smashbox, in fact) and have used Urban Decay's as well, so I have something to compare bliss' to, and I have to say, this aerosol  spray is really nice in that once you spray it on your face, your face feels dry and your makeup is set and doesn't appear wet at all. There's no 'splatter' or worry about the spray drying (especially if you're wearing glasses). HOWEVER, there is a scent, a chemical scent, that does linger for about an hour (maybe less) which while not too bad, I definitely notice. That's why it's not five stars.
But it works, it sets the makeup and it looks good. I'm used to the price considering the other sprays I've bought. Just wish the scent was better (or non-existent).",1468972800,2016-07-20

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

But for me this stuff delivers almost like magic. After using it for only two weeks I have already noticed a healthier shine to my skin and a lot of the dryness has gone away. My skin is also softer and some of the small wrinkles around my eyes have even faded slightly. As someone who doesn't really use any high-end creams I was a bit taken aback by the price tag on such a small container but given the amount that I use each day (applying before work and before bed) I think this little container should last at least 6 months - a tiny bit of this serum goes a long way.

I was wondering if my reaction was maybe some kind of confirmation bias since I knew I was putting this on and was looking for results, but a few people at work have also told me recently that my skin looks great. From other reviewers it sounds like this stuff isn't for everyone (maybe different skin types?) but if you have dry, sensitive skin, this stuff is a face-saver!",1391731200,2014-02-07

It's is comfortable to hold, with no concern over it being slippery and it is extremely soft and light. I'm not so familiar with ""buffing"", but I can say this one works well for my loose mineral powder and if I didn't mind mixing brushes it would also work for my blusher. My mineral powder is applied light and evenly using it and if looking for a higher quality brush I would easily recommend this one.",1458777600,2016-03-24
5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

5.0,"Definitely an upgrade versus regular shave creams. You can tell it is filled with a lot of lubricants and conditioners. May take an extra step of unscrewing the cap using your hand to get some out, but it does make for a more luxurious (only word I could think of) shave. It has the texture and consistency of a cross between axle grease and soap, but doesn't smell like it! I believe it does add a layer of protection. What it reminds me of is the lubricating strips on a razor. I think of it as a liquefied version of that.

One thing I have to wonder about, though, is if you actually get a smoother shave, or it just feels like you do. After shaving, my skin feels like there are no leftover stubs at all. All I feel is smooth, conditioned skin. But I believe part of that feeling is created by all the lubricating ingredients in it. In other words, the lubricants may be simply making my hand slide smoother, over any leftover beard stubs. It's a nice feeling, but I have to wonder if it is the shave cream more that a closer shave.

Overall, though, this is nice to have. It adds an extra dimension to the act of shaving. I like the feeling of my face afterwards. The price, however, may be a bit much for an everyday product. I think this would make an excellent and unique gift.

UPDATE 2/13/14 - It must be good since now I'm going to buy a jar (I got the first one free on the Vine program to review). I originally got this in late August (6 months ago) and I am now out of it.

I did have a problem that is worth mentioning.  It turns out that I am allergic to Badger hair.  Who knew!?!?  I developed allergies to Cats and birds many years ago.  I have a more mild allergy to dogs... even the hypoallergenic ones.  My advice is that you be cautious with the lovely Badger hair brush if you have known allergies to other fur bearers.

4.0,"Update:  I like the way this feels on my face, the way it moisturizes, nourishes & illuminates my skin. I ran out a few months ago, and  finally decided to purchase more.

I have normal skin, with  fine wrinkles that come with age. I've been using StriVectinLABS Booster Oil for about a week now. You're instructed to use 2 to 3 drops twice a day after cleansing your skin. Then follow through with your normal skin care routine. The Booster Oil is very moisturizing. It is so moisturizing that I continually forget to apply my moisturizer.

The Booster Oil seems to be a little bit thinner than argan oil. I like its light lemony scent. In my experience, the Booster Oil takes a couple minutes to absorb. Maybe this is because my skin isn't dry. I use a magnifying mirror & always check before and after I apply the Booster Oil. My skin really does look more luminous after I apply the oil and my fine wrinkles aren't as noticeable.

The dropper lid has a pump on top. Instead of squeezing a bulb, you push on the pump to fill the dropper.

All in all, I'm pleased with the Booster Oil, and will update my review as I continue to use the product.

This Booster Oil is based on the NIA-114 technology. You can learn more about this ingredient/technology by doing an internet search.

I received the wrong insert in the package. I hope StriVectinLABS corrects this error.",1415664000,2014-11-11

5.0,"I have naturally medium beige skin (I'm naturally not pale but not tan either, but I will very easily tan without burning). I live in Florida now and most of the year I'll keep my tan now, but I discovered this product years ago before my exodus to the Sunshine State. This used to be a well kept pageant girl secret before it became main stream but now the secret is out.

There are several things needed to make this look even and natural. First is shower, shave, and exfoliate. Get the most scrubby salt body wash you have and use it. Rough off all the dead skin you can to make sure you can to get the tan to last longer. If you don't buy the foam mitt to apply this, you'll regret it. Some people use latex gloves but it ends up getting applied uneven and streaky because late doesn't absorb the mousse (on purpose) but the mitten they designed to apply it with absorbs just a touch to make it apply perfectly evenly. Also it can be flipped over if you're applying this stuff without a friend to help get that spot in the middle of your back that nobody can EVER REACH.

The guide color will help you apply the product evenly but keep in mind that the color will darken more than that over several hours. I let it dry without any clothes for a few minutes then put on a large loose T shirt and large sweatpants for an hour or so to avoid crease lines and sweat marks in the product while it dries. The smell is very faint but the tan will be darker if you don't wash off the guide color. A light white lotion like Lubriderm will keep the skin moisturized and lock in the color-apply after a few hours. Shower the next day and your color will remain.

Keep skin moisturized and avoid shaving every day for tan longevity, apply fully once a week if you want optimal tan results full time. This product is amazing and with a little maintenance can fool someone into thinking your tan in 100% beach bunny.",1464134400,2016-05-25

3.0,"Japonesque foundation offers light to medium coverage. It is priced to fall mid-range between drug store lines that sell for about ten dollars a bottle and luxury lines that go for over sixty. It comes in a good quality, glass bottle with a pump applicator.

I tried the #4 shade which was a neutral to cool beige that would be appropriate for those with light, as opposed to pale or medium, complexions. I have a light olive complexion and usually wear the second to third lightest color offered and #4 was maybe just a tad dark on my untanned skin.

I followed instructions and applied the foundation with a brush and then feathered it with a sponge. I also applied the foundation with my fingertips and then feathered with a sponge. Both times, the foundation went on smoothly and was able to be layered over areas that needed slightly more coverage. The foundation took some time to fully dry and set. At first it seemed a bit sticky but it dried to a soft finish and did not feel mask-like.

I used a full arsenal of makeup over the foundation: under eye cream, cream and powder blush, contour powder, cream highlighter, powder, and all blended fairly easily into the foundation.

The finished result was ok, but I have to say, it really did not enhance the quality of my skin. Nor did it look particularly ""natural"" nor particularly ""luminous."" In fact, Japonesque was not noticeably better than the highly rated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Oreal-Paris-True-Match-Super-Blendable-Makeup/dp/B007BMR3L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Oreal Paris True Match Super Blendable Makeup</a>&nbsp;which comes in over 30 shades and sells in drug stores for one third the price of Japonseque.

To me, however, it comes off as smelling a bit ""cheap"".

A little bit of it goes a long way.  One spritz lasts a few hours before it starts to dissipate.

4.0,"I have used this serum for almost two weeks now and am pleased with the results. I am a fifty-something year old woman with a light completion and these are the results I have noted:

The fine lines around my eyes and mouth have lessened.
My skin feels very soft all day but not greasy.
The product does not irritate my skin which tends to be on the sensitive side of the spectrum.
My deeper forehead lines and nasolabial and marionette lines are unaffected. (Yes, I had to look up what those last two lines are called.)
The product itself is thin and drippy and you have to be quick to catch and apply it or it just runs off your fingers.
I am sensitive to perfumes but this products scent does not bother me at all.

Overall I really like this stuff but am not sure that I am willing to pay the current asking price for the modest results I have seen. If you are looking for a mild product to reduce your fine lines and money is not an object, I would recommend this one.

5.0,"I used this kit yesterday and today my hair is smooth and soft and definitely a lot stronger.  I used 1/2 ounce of #1 with 3 ounces of water (you can use less if your hair is short or more if it's longer) and applied it to dry hair.  I left this on for a couple of hours and then applied #2 directly on top and left the mixture on for another couple of hours.  I then shampooed and applied a hydrating mask for about 45 minutes with heat.  I then rinsed for a full five minutes and then applied my regular styling products and let my hair air dry overnight.  This morning my hair is in great shape and it looks and feels very healthy, almost like virgin hair.  My hair is color treated and I also have highlights and although my colorist uses Olaplex fatihfully, it is also quite damaged from aggressive heat styling.  In addition, I've had a small amount of breakage recently so I needed this Olaplex treatment because it can stop breakage cold.  When I combed my hair yesterday after this two step treatment, I had absolutely zero breakage.  My hair is very smooth and the ends no longer look frazzled or frayed but now lay smooth and flat.  I will continue to use #1 and #2 regularly, which will only improve my hair's condition.  I recommend this kit for anyone with damaged hair.  But if your hair is not damaged, Olaplex will not make any difference.  I do recommend using a hydrating mask afterward because Olaplex can sometimes leave hair feeling dry.  You can also do an intensive protein treatment after Olaplex but before the mask.  This will restore even the most damaged hair to a healthier state.  Following this Olaplex stand alone treatment with protein and moisture is recommended on the company's website.  You can of course add #1 to color or  bleach but you'll want to bump up the strength of the developer because Olaplex slows processing time, especially for bleach.  I got this kit from my stylist and I would be leery of ordering it on Amazon, where fakes abound.  However, read the reviews thoroughly and if possible order it through Prime, that way you can return it if it doesn't look right.  The Olaplex labels are easily counterfeited so you need to make sure the bottles are sealed and that there is an instruction manual in the package.  There should also be a measuring device for the bottle of #1.  Hope you like it as much as I do.",1458259200,2016-03-18

3.0,"There were several things I liked about this product.  First of all, I liked the consistency of this night cream.  I expect my night cream to be thick.  We are to protect our skin during the day and repair our skin at night, so I want my night cream to be substantially thicker.  I also liked that it did not have an overbearing smell.  I also was glad to see a small spatula for dipping into the jar and getting your desired amount of cream out without having to use your fingers and therefore contaminating the product.  I also thought there was a substantial amount of product in the jar.  What I didn't like was the price.  I find $115.00 for a facial moisturizer to be excessive especially since it didn't provide any better results than a $38.00 of moisturizer I normally use. I used the entire jar before I wrote this review because I wanted to give a fair and unbiased review.  The jar lasted almost a month and I used it every night.

4.0,"I bought this because I have very weak nails.  I mean they can bend backwards AND forwards with no issue whatsoever.  I had originally seen this item on Pinterest and looked more into it on Amazon.  I read all of the review prior to buying and made the decision to buy this matte version over the original as I don't care for my nails to be too shiny.  I've also never been one to wear nail polish on my fingernails.  I purchased this product a little over a month ago.  It arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion.  I followed the instructions to a T.  First night, 2 coats and then 1 coat every other evening.  I found it dried rather quickly and because it was clear, I didn't feel the need to hold up my hands away from away from everything for fear of smudges.  Within a week, my nails were already looking and feeling better.  They didn't bend forward nearly as easily as prior to using and there was no way I could bend them backwards.  The tips of my fingernails though were weird.  At first, the whiteness started to disappear and then a few days later came back whiter than ever.  Not sure why, but I'm not complaining as my co-worker actually asked me the other day where I got my acrylics done.  So, this product worked quite well for me and I am a lifetime user.

Now, the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you basically have to use it forever for your nails to stay hard.  I decided after about 3 1/2  weeks of using this as directed to see what would happen if I stopped.  Well, my nails grew as to be expected, but the hardness of them was gone.  They pretty much went right back to the way before I started using this product.  So, while it worked for me as stated, I will have to use it forever.",1365120000,2013-04-05

I SAID below that I hadn't noticed any difference in the lines between my eyes.  WELL, that has changed. The lines are Definitely reduced.  I'm shocked and amazed... and have fallen in love.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND you try this.

=========================
Now that I'm older I've discovered that I can indeed have dry skin.  That after decades of battling oil, I now have to worry about chapped skin and skin that is badly in need of hydration.

One of the problems I have in finding solutions is that I have very sensitive skin (with lots of allergies) and I have skin that can still have a breakout problem if I use something excessively greasy.  So I was interested in trying out this 'booster oil'.

One thing I liked was the ingredients. Nothing that I could find that you couldn't buy in the EU with it's higher requirements.  The next thing I discovered was that this booster oil didn't cause any allergic reaction.  I tried it on the inside of my elbow and wrist first, then on my neck and finally on my face.  All good.

I am using the booster oil by itself and in conjunction with the two creams I use:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Oreal-Paris-RevitaLift-cheap/dp/B000KONYPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift (cheap)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Occitane-Immortelle-Divine-Cream-expensive/dp/B00ET3D5VK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream (expensive)</a>.

RESULTS
 I've hit the lines between my brows with the booster oil by itself, and later with a combination of the booster oil and creams... and I've noticed no difference.  If this changes, I'll report.

 I've used the booster oil to supplement my creams and... I be gosh darned if it hasn't improved the look of my skin.  I haven't noticed changes to the micro-creases I have, but my skin looks smoother --both in the less irritated sense, and in the more uniform complexion sense.

SUMMARY
One thing I've noticed is that prices can change radically after the first rounds of reviews come out, so I won't comment on price; it could change.

I like this booster oil.  It actually doesn't take much to enhance the effectiveness of other creams/cremes, and it didn't irritate my skin.

I know other people have said that it absorbs right in.  That's not been my experience. It's an oil, it acts like it.  But it's not greasy and if you don't overdo it, you won't shine for long.

I did experience an improvement in the tone of my complexion.",1415923200,2014-11-14

3.0,"First off, I do want to say that if I were rating these on blade/cut quality alone, they would, hands down, be 5 stars. They cut evenly, quickly, and cleanly. I honestly didn't realize how shoddy standard drugstore type clippers were before using these.

So, if nail clippers are designed to do one thing (well, two if you count the file) and they do it beautifully, why the lukewarm rating? I don't care what kinds of design awards these things won, they are flat out awkward to use. They're bad enough on my own fingernails and nearly impossible for me to cut my child's nails with. The part that pops out and then back in to make the lever loves to slip out just enough to make it not close all the way.

Besides the slippage, there is also just the way these feel in the hand. The bottom isn't a solid piece, so if you don't hold it just right it is uncomfortable. And they're small...and I have small hands.

So, I would say that for design I would give these a 1-star, for blades, a 5 star, so an overall of 3. However, unless you just have an awful time getting clippers to cut through your nails, I could not recommend these.",1433808000,2015-06-09

I'm 50, my skin is different and the once great Everyday minerals (olive tones) is making my pores and rougher texture more noticeable. I'm half Japanese and half Caucasian and it's a pain for find the right color for me! Everything is either pink or orange on me! Well I've look high and low end trying to  find something that would work for me. Liquids and powders, both loose and pressed. CC and BB's and all in between! Bought this  without doing any research at my local mall. My first color was a bomb, Teakwood. Too orange in the natural light. They replaced it with Golden Glow. After many test wears and having the family tell me what they thought I think I found my foundation. Pros: Very fine milled and does not show fine lines and pores, really softens and smooths out the skin. Coverage is very buildable. Color is not pink or orange! Very yellowish in tone. Cons: Yep, it's a pricey one. My suggestion is that if at all possible buy first at a store to find your color match. LOTS of different colors in the pressed powder.",1416700800,2014-11-23

5.0,"If you are rocking a slicked down style this is a great pomade.  It gives my short hair shine and keeps it looking styled all day.  That said, if you are doing a style that has more of a high-but-natural look like a tall pompadour this pomade may be too heavy for the look.  Depending on how thick your hair is, this cream can have the tendency to weigh your hair down deflating your pomp.  Not good.  As always, it's about using the right tool for the job - this cream pomade will work brilliantly if your wearing your hair like Blaine on Glee, but will tank if you try to use it for a style like Kurt.  Sorry for the Glee reference, but those were the first two people who came to mind with the right hairstyles.",1397520000,2014-04-15
5.0,"Verdict? This product is great.
I was skeptical of this blush at first, thinking ""cream to powder"" meant it would go on like either foundation from a compact or lipstick, and then have to be rubbed in hard to distribute. I was so wrong. It goes on silky-silky soft and subtle (seriously--I tried it on my lips and it was far more silky than any lipstick I've ever tried, though it then settled to a gentle powder). And when it said to apply over blush for a more ""dramatic"" look, I had images of 1980s blush streaks, but nothing could be further from the truth. It goes on super-super subtle and soft. Yes, you *can* push hard to get it a bit darker, but you'd really have to work at it--by default it goes on as gently as a typical powder blush. And the color (Candid) is a subtle-subtle pinkish, so it will probably work with most skin tones as it's too gentle to clash :-P and easy to distribute (with just a fingertip) for a moment or two after applying. I tried it on my lips and it made almost no difference--took a tiny bit of the color out of them, but was hardly noticeable. It was super-subtle on my eyelids as well; I'll probably just use it as blush.

I was a bit surprised at the shape of the container. I think I must have been expecting something shaped like lipstick, because this was really short at just 2"" (lipstick is usually 3-4""), and stubby/wide (1"" diameter whereas lipstick is normally 1/2-3/4"" wide). But that actually worked better for broad/smooth application vs. narrow streaks, so it makes sense.

1.0,"I was really excited about the concept of this product, as I am a powdered dry shampoo user in the interest of saving water, and thought this couch be a nice tool in my product collection, but it is truly awful.  I could see this being POSSIBLY useful for someone with really short hair who wants to skip a wash and have some lift if used JUST in the roots, but even that is hard for me to picture being manageable.  The product is so sticky and grainy that while it does have the effect of removing oil, what's left in your hair is way grosser than oil.  It might look passable, but it feels just terrible, my hairbrush stuck in it and it broke my hair, I couldn't wash it off my hands and after THREE shampoos, I could still feel it in my hair (getting a comb stuck in it), and that was all using a TINY amount, and rubbing it well between my fingers before applying it sparingly.

I used it once and thought it was gross but decided to at least play with it once more before a shower in case I had used too much or hadn't thinned it enough, but no, it was still awful.

As others have said, the smell is nice enough but not overpowering, which is the only nice thing to say about this product.  I am certainly glad this was a review item.. if I had paid the crazy price for this I would be returning it for my money back.",1475366400,2016-10-02

5.0,"I started off with Gelish and have worked my way through the various gel products.
Here is a thorough review--with tips---if you are on the fence about what to buy!
http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWRFDI073BON/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3VWRFDI073BON

Strawberry Smoothie was my first Shellac purchase. I thought it would be a solid pink, so when it arrived and I saw how sheer it really was, I was at first disappointed. But!! After using it, it made THE perfect go-with-anything neutral nail. I have very pink nail beds anyway, so this looked like I'd gotten a clear polish  manicure and just have naturally pretty nail beds. I used Lomasi top and base coats because that is what I have (and like). This works just fine with the Lomasi brand. I also use an LED light and 30 seconds for each color coat. The Shellac smells like regular polish until cured, which was amusing to me. Definitely stinkier than Gelish or other brands.

I have to say that Shellac and Lomasi rank RIGHT UP THERE for me, in so many areas. The brushes in them are great! They are easy to use, and they make the tiny window of time I have to do my nails, worthwhile. The Shellac seems to cure thicker, harder, and have a more durable finish than Gelish or Red Carpet. I am very pleased at how my nails look when I've used this product and will be buying more Shellac colors.

I couldn't be happier with my gel nail experience, using the Shellac products. I have ZERO complaints about them, which is pretty amazing if you have read my Gelish review and see how much I gripe about the various products. I felt that the Shellac product was a professional quality item, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy other Shellac items nor would I hesitate to recommend them to anyone! They are worth the price, for the total satisfaction they deliver. When you figure that your TIME is valuable, this really factors into the value of this product.",1352332800,2012-11-08
5.0,"As a long time user of Axe body sprays, I was definitely intrigued when I saw Calvin Klein making a splash into the body deodorant marketplace that Ace has a death grip on. Eternity Now definitely has a stronger, more fragrant scent than the Axe sprays that for the most part are very light and pleasant before fading out scent wise throughout the day. The Eternity scent stays with you, mostly because he starting scent is so strong and pungent. If you like this smell, you will love the Eternity as it could almost be used as a cologne replacement as well, and in my opinion that is the niche market where this product has the opportunity to thrive. As a hybrid deodorant/cologne, this product goes from being one of the most expensive deodorants sprays on the market to being one of the cheaper designer-quality colognes. If you like pleasant, strong smelling colognes with rich undertones and you're looking to shave some money off your cologne spending, this product is worth trying out. But if you're sold on the cologne you wear that isn't overpowered by your current Axe body spray, take a pass on this offering because this spray will definitely overpower your cologne.",1446249600,2015-10-31

5.0,"I know many people don't get the purpose of thermal water, especially the Evian thermal spray. People tend to associate Evian only with drinking water, and find this aerosol to be no more than a gimmick.
Thermal water works wonders to balance the Ph of the skin, especially for sensitive skin. It can also be used to refresh the skin throughout the day. Some even use it to set their makeup because of the fine, even mist.
I keep mine in the refrigerator and use it first thing in the morning after washing my face. My son has very dry skin, he suffers from eczema, and loves to use it every few hours to add a bit of moisture and refresh the skin.
Ive tried several types of thermal water- Vichy, La Roche Posay, Avene- and the Evian is hands down my favorite; Ive been using it for about 8 years now. Its mostly due to the fact that Evians spray nozzle sprays evenly and is the most consistent, bottle after bottle.
The results from the other brands are practically identical, at least when it comes to its effect on the skin, but Evian is just more dependable. Theres no leaking from the nozzle, no uneven spraying, no clogs, and all the water gets used up.

However it transfers easily and in my opinion needs to be reapplied occasionally if you want to have that shine-free finished look to last all day long.  It helps to even out uneven skin tones and blotches, but when it comes to blemishes or dry patches they seem to stand out more since the powder sits in the cracks and crevices which makes them look more obvious.  The powder is silky smooth and soft to the touch with a matte finish.

It has a nice berry type fragrance which is just nice and not too overwhelming. I could tell right away that my hair was more manageable  and had more body. It gave it a nice smooth finish and when I used a curling iron it made he curls more defined.

I like this shower gel.  It smells good (of course that is an opinion), citrus clean, lathers really well & feels gentle on my skin. The scent is fairly unisex; not flowery or heavy musky/manly.

The ingredients are not that unusual for a shower gel.  On the other hand, the scent is really quite good & not cheap smelling & it does leave my skin feeling soft & very lightly scented.

5.0,"I've owned brushes from MAC and from Mary Kay, as well as various dollar store brands in between. The softest I ever felt were the ones from Mary Kay. I don't know what wizardry they're up to over there, but they're extremely soft. The MAC ones are actually kind of rough feeling, to be honest. The Japonesque brush is somewhere in between in terms of softness. I'd say it's closer to the Mary Kay side of softness.

Loose powder:
The brush holds enough loose powder to be able to lay down plenty of it. If you want to go for a lighter application, dust it off on the edge of your powder box. I've used it for the Gold Dust powder from MAC, and it can give you great coverage really quickly. Same goes for dusting powder of other colours. It works lovely.

Pressed Powder:
For pressed powder, I generally don't use such a big brush, but I wanted to test it out anyway so that you'll know how it works if you choose to do so. It does take up the pressed powder, but it's not stiff enough to make much of an impression. You'd do better with another brush for pressed powder.

Blending:
This is where this brush really shines. After laying down the lowlights and highlights, I can run this brush over the edges to get everything blended down to a fare-the-well. What's also great is that if your bronzer or blush or whatever other makeup is the wrong colour, you just lift it up with the brush, and then lay it on the skin. Then, add a different colour to balance it out, and blend. Because the brush is so soft, you can do the blending directly on your face without irritating it.

It also works to blend on your table. Sometimes I'll lay down two colours to blend them before putting them on my skin. This works great. There's a blush that I like whose base is too pink for my liking. So I'll blend it with a spot of orange, and a bit of red to get the colour I want, and then put it on my face. This brush works great for that. (Granted, the cleanup on my table after a heavy makeup session gets messy, but it's all sorted with makeup remover wipes.)",1459641600,2016-04-03

Apply medium and darker shades to the hollow of the cheeks and anywhere the sun naturally hits you.

Step 2
Apply the lighter shade as a highlight along cheekbones, the bridge of the nose and cupids bow.

There is a contour brush that you can use with it.  I used my index finger and though probably not the best tool, it worked for me.  I applied it after I applied my foundation and saw a difference.  Another time I applied it after applying my tinted moisturizer.  Also made a big difference.

3.0,"These come in a cute box that does warn not to use these on thin skin, irritated, or sensitive skin.  I had put a streak on my leg with some self-tanner to test this with, right on the front of my shin, and it came off quickly without a lot of rubbing at all. It left the sponge looking like it had just a bit of makeup on it.  I just wet the area that I was going to use, and rubbed it up and down about twice and the streak was gone.  My skin is ok- my skin is normally pretty good though and doesn't get irritated easily.
However, these really are just small, decorative melamine sponges and they won't last for long if they are used a lot.  They are a good quality, supple melamine at least.  They really are quite abrasive and I've no doubt this is working by taking the top layer of skin off.  The potential to damage skin is definitely there if one is not careful.

It leaves me feeling a bit ambivalent about this product.  It does work, but there are less expensive melamine sponges, and it should be used with a lot of care not to abrade the skin too much.",1424217600,2015-02-18
4.0,"My barber recommended Bona Fide Superior Hold Pomade for me when I switched to him from a salon. I've been using the BF for about six months now and really like it. The one thing which I have a love/hate relationship in regards to the BF is that it's water based. I love being able to rinse my head out under the faucet before bed without showering to get the product out. On the other hand, when participating in sports, if I forget to rinse my head first, I typically have it running down my face and it isn't the best tasting stuff on the planet. BF does give an excellent all day hold, my wavy hair tends to overcome it after a while though.

The barber I use, also has homemade petrolatum based products which is a heavier weight and does manage my hair better in regards to the wave. The downside of course is cleanup at the end of the day. When he gave me the sample, he suggested that I first use shampoo in my dry hair to break up the product, and then do a normal wet wash. This worked somewhat, but even then, there was some product left, so I never really liked using the petrolatum product.

The Jack Black product is also petrolatum based, which is the only reason I'm not a huge fan. I'm not going to ding the product for that reason, as it isn't fair, know what you're buying and the consequences of it. The hold of a petrolatum product is superior for my hair, and this product doesn't let you down. I will use this on occasion for the reasons mentioned in the homemade product. It may become my emergency supply, or used on days when I know I will be more active and sweating.

Constency wise, it feels completely different that the other dr brandt serum I've tried.  This is more of a light lotion, somewhat thick.  Disolves INSTANTLY into the face, yet doesn't seem to really moisturize.  Also, when followed with moisturizer, the combination felt a touch minty/tingly.

5.0,"This is a wonderful sunless self-tanning gel that doesn't have the yucky scent that the less expensive ones do.  Xen-Tan's light cucumber melon scented gel is pleasant and leaves a medium to medium dark tan depending on your skin tone and how long you leave it on.

The first time I tried it I applied it with a plastic-gloved hand and the separately available mitt on the larger, smoother areas of my body (legs, arms, chest).  I just used the gloved hand for my face and it turned out nice and even thanks to the tinted color of the gel.  I left it on for about 3 hours as I wanted to see how dark I would get in this time.  After showering, I had a nice, even color that looked like I'd laid out, without the dkin cancer risk or the red burn!  It was a bit sticky for awhile after applying, about 45 minutes before I felt comfortable putting on loose fitting clothes but it was worth it.  It was hard to wait the rest of the time to see the results but it is the price you must pay, unfortunately, and it is a lot less annoying than the self-tanners with the weird odor.

My husband was surprised to see a suntanned me when he got home from work and thought I'd been outside all afternoon. Thank you Xen-Tan!

With Fall here and Winter on the way, it's nice to know I don't have to be pasty white, go on vacation, or wait until Spring to have a natural looking tan.  This is a bit pricey but not if compared to the cost of a spray tan and you can get at least 3 or 4 body tans from one tube, and more if you don't do your whole body. This is depending on your size, of course.

I had a nice, natural color for the week with daily showers.  I didn't have stained clothing or bedding.  Love it!",1445731200,2015-10-25
5.0,"After many years of dreading shaving I decided to start using a straight razor. Wish I had gone this route years ago. My shave is now a ritual. I love to shave now. I love the feel and weight of the razor and the skill it takes to produce a smooth shave. One of the problems I was having was finding the right soap. I read many reviews and besides wool fat soap, the Proraso comes out on top.  I tried it, I love, love, love it. Smooth, silky, great lather. Buying this proves you don't have to spend a fortune to become a wet shaver. you can buy a fine, shave ready razor, a nice badger brush and this great Proraso Soap, right here on Amazon! If you have never had a straight shave, get one!  Then get a nice razor. Great forums online but you will see the Proraso is always highly rated.",1420502400,2015-01-06
4.0,"For a week and a half, I used this as my sole moisturizer. I paired it with the Obagi foaming gel (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F6XZNOO), and some Vitamin C serum, but avoided all my other products in order to see what this stuff really does.

Like most face products, any directions given are mostly useless. In the morning and evening or as needed. Really, no kidding. How much should I use? No clue. So for about a week I used a full pump, then it seemed that might take me through the bottle too quick, so I cut back to about half that.
I used it every morning and every night, but Im going to stop that. Ill use it every other night or maybe just a couple times a week to refresh my skin.

First, I didn't break out at all. Normally I do when I switch face products. So thats a plus!
Second, this stuff does FEEL hydrating. My face seemed to like it. I don't notice any particular softness but I also didn't dry out. Its not greasy.
I didn't notice any particular improvement in my skin condition, but also it didn't hurt at all.

So 4-stars?
Well, I THINK it does what it claims, which is simple. Hydrate = Check!
But all the ingredients make for an odd smell. Its not scented, it just has a sort of buttery/flour-like smell. It definitely applies like a shea butter, really smooth and soft. So, I took out a star for the smell.

Also, there seem to be a lot of reviews that mention Obagi or Obaji. Those are two different names, so Im not sure if that has something to do with it, but there are also several people who have used Obagi from doctors offices and say this is different. Currently, this item is showing as Unavailable on Amazon, with no distributor.

So it seems the court is still in session on this one.",1486684800,2017-02-10

Then I slowly see a pile of powder forming on my hair, and I had to mix it in with my fingers. I even tried using the Great Hair Day brush, to no avail - the brush didn't pick up on the Toppik powder.

3.0,"I'm in my late thirties and I have sensitive skin, large pores, and shiny in my T-zone, I have some fine lines around my eyes, and laugh lines about the mouth. I do have persistently puffy bags under my eyes. I took a picture when I started and after almost a month of use I took another picture. I could not discern any results. I have in the past seen remarkably results with retinol products.

The product comes in a squeeze tube - didn't realize when I started I needed to remove the aplication tip and remove the foil over the tube. (Whoops) The texture of the cream is a fine cream, not too thick, not too watery. There is a subtle floral fragrance, it's not bad, and it dissipates quickly. A little goes a long way. The lotion absorbed into the skin nicely. Dispite the scent there was no burning feeling to my sensitive skin.

This does make a great moisturizer. It dries well, not oily or greasy and your face doesn't feel tight or dry or overly oily. I just didn't notice any major changes. I would be willing to try the whole line of products to see if that made a difference. As is I have the thermal water spray and this, perhaps I should also try a cleanser to keep my face in the same pH and maybe I would see a better result.",1447372800,2015-11-13
5.0,"The best thing about this set is the tool.  That's why this product is a 5 star rating.  It really makes the cost worthwhile.  Using your finger to put on under eye cover up can put undue pressure on your under eye are.  This tool is lightweight and angled to give the best coverage.  The make up itself lasts above average amount of time. You get a lot of it in the jar, but it doesn't always last the whole day.  You may need a touch up. I've tried a lot of under eye concealers, and I've found that a need for touch up to always be the case which is why I said above average. I usually have fair skin but my face has tanned a lot this summer so medium is a good compromise.  I will need lighter in the winter.  When deciding color for under your eyes, you can go a bit darker than the skin tone on your face (but not too much darker). I'm not sure about the anti wrinkle part, but I think it's working.  I use a Lancome product during the day and another at night under my eyes so it's difficult to compare the anti wrinkle aspect. However, I do think my under eyes are a bit lighter so I don't have as dark of circles since starting this product.  I think this product has a lot to offer, and recommend it.",1434844800,2015-06-21

4.0,"CK2 is a very interesting scent, the strongest tones that I detect are citrusy, reminding me strongly of grapefruit. The secondary tones do come in at the end for me, but they do not have a strong presence in my opinion. It's not a strong scent and does not seem to last for very long, I would say an hour or two at max, less in high sun conditions. I would definitely classify this as a ""sporty scent,"" good for day time use, but maybe a little too bright for the nighttime (although that's really up to the wearer). It reminds me a bit of the Davidoff Cool Water line.

Unisex or not?  I can see it being unisex, but the scent does lean more towards the floral than the musky. I really do think either sex can successfully carry this scent. If I were to smell it wiithout any introduction, I would probably assume it was for the women rather than the men.

The bottle - for you bottle lovers - is unique.  The 1.7oz version has a large acrylic cap with the atomizer pointed downwards.  The bottle itself cannot rest without the cap as it's perfectly cylindrical on the sides and rounded on the bottom.  The topper is the only flat piece. If you loose it, the bottle is going to be rolling around unless you support it.  The plain and clear glass does stand out against other more ornate designs and looks nice and clean.

It's a nice general scent that will fit well into a rotation or as a daily use for the day, however if you're looking for a standout performer, this probably doesn't have quite the punch you're looking for.",1461024000,2016-04-19

4.0,"I have very dry skin.. and wrinkles. How could I  not accept the offer to try Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer? I gave this one 3 stars out of the box, because no animal testing is done. Star #4 was because it has natural products and no heavy fragrance. Also, it moisturizes. I began using it the morning it arrived and have been using it morning and night for several days.

Here is what i think. No product on the planet really makes wrinkles unwrinkle. There are a lot of products out there and some disappoint me because i find out that they use animal testing in the production of the product. Not necessary. In my particular case, I am sensitive to all sorts of environmental chemicals and drugs, so I like to stay as natural as possible with all of the products that I use in my home and on my person.

This product feels light to the touch and absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy feel to it. I am able to apply make up immediately, with no wait time. Nothing makes wrinkles go away, but this does soften the skin and does away with flakiness.

My main caveat is that it's very expensive for such a small bottle. Fortunately you don't need to use a lot each time you wash your face, but given the many options out there, I would be more likely to buy this on a regular basis if the price point was lower.",1487721600,2017-02-22

4.0,"I didn't expect to like this, thinking it was Just Another Basic Moisturizer (but with organic ingredients - yawn). But color me impressed.

Shea butter is the 2nd ingredient after the ""juices"".  Because of this, the texture is actually a delight -- imagine shea butter diluted down to an emulsion, creating a thin, flexible, protective film on your face that acts as a barrier/primer.  It has that matte drydown often found in shea, but is much thinner and lighter -- the slight firming sensation acts as a temporary ""freeze"" while filling in pores and fine lines. Amazingly, I found it effective as a wind chafing barrier, cushioning my face from the biting cold. I love that it is non-oily in texture, allowing me to layer stuff over it. No pilling at all -- compatible with your other serums/sunscreens/foundations.

Now, a moisturizer that simply hydrates is not good enough! we demand more from our products these days. To show truly efficacious results, this cream has to DO something else. That's where the AHA's come in. The fruit acids to act as low level AHA's (i'd guess it's 5% or less), so you won't see visible brightness overnight -- but over a few weeks, you'll feel your skin texture getting smoother, more refined.

The AHA's are crucial in this product because without them, your dead skin cells would just accumulate, and the lipid ingredients in this cream would simply bind those dead cells together, causing dullness and clogs. Also it is silicone-free (silicone is notorious for causing clogs), and it has other ""good-for-you"" nutrients like antioxidants and DMAE. But really--it's the AHA's that do the most.

In summary, this formulation is a good combo of light AHA's and hydrating ingredients while steering clear of the ""no-no""s. If you are looking for an immediate refining/ brightening effect, only a professional peel or IPL/laser treatment would do that; i'd recommend this cream as a good ""maintenance"" cream that gradually further refines skin on a slower basis, albeit much gentler.",1416614400,2014-11-22

The bags are starting and the smile crinkles are there when I don't smile. I resigned myself to reality and aging. I have used many good quality expensive creams and gels that feel good but don't seem to make any significant change.

BUT I started using the Retinol 0.5 alongside the Obagi Professional-C Peptide Complex about 5-6 weeks ago. And while I don't have before and after (I wish I did now) I can't get over the noticeable difference. I follow the directions and try to use the sparing amounts recommended. I was concerned the first week of use because immediately after application my skin really flushed and then I got areas on my check and around the eyes that started peeling (a thin layer). I stuck it out and now I have neither issue. I must say, my skin hasn't looked this smooth and even-toned in AGES.

I had my concerns as this is a skincare product normally sold under a dermatologist's care and observation. I really didn't have any problems and I am sold on the Obagi line. With these results, I feel good to say that I believe the product I received is legit. The cream's not especially unique in appearance and fragrance-- a normal moisturizer type texture that I take care to spread out with 2-3 pumps of eraser-sized dollops.

Would I have listened if someone had told me back then what would happen to my skin as it aged? No, I seriously doubt that I would have because I was too busy getting the tan lines even..........fast forward to 2016 and a 10X magnifying mirror is not my friend.  And, there is no magic tube of anything that will erase all the damage caused by sun and as the years progressed,  prescription medications, etc. I just want to look as healthy as I can without causing more damage and so many exfoliators on the market are just too strong, especially for someone fair-skinned like me with mild rosacea.

After reading other reviews on Crepe Erase I thought I would give it a try and I am so glad I did!  I live in a dry climate and I have very dry skin and sometimes I just don't take that good care of it so I have flaky skin as well, ugh.

I actually could SEE the difference on my arms and legs after using the Crepe Erase just one time.  Anything was an improvement, but this improvement was really noticeable and my skin felt so soft.  I mean, I was really happy with how I looked!  My skin was healthier to look at and it did not look as crepey as it did before.

The down side is the cost which is just not in my fixed income budget so I would not use it as often as I would like.  And, now I really want to try the facial product because that's where I see the damage the most.

5.0,"I use a powder mineral foundation and this is the first primer I've tried that keeps my makeup flawlessly matte all day long. With other products I would be blotting an oily shine off my face after about 4 hours. The first day I used this primer I looked in the mirror before washing my face that night and was shocked to see my makeup was still matte and perfect.
Many primers have silicone in them and I can feel that layer sitting on my skin. The Vincent Longo Water Canvas base feels great when applying and you just need a little bit so the tube will last a long time. It disappears on my skin and I don't feel that I have a primer on.
My other primers went in the trash and even though this product costs more the results and the way it feels on my skin make it well worth it.",1393459200,2014-02-27
4.0,"I'm a fan of tea tree oil as an ingredient in certain body care products. However, sometimes the smell/fragrance can be unpleasant and/or over powering. Happily, this is NOT the case with this product. So if you share this concern based on past experience with other products with tea tree oil, know that this product has only a very light (and pleasant and ""neutral"" as it were) scent. I'm hyper sensitive to fragrance in products and this presented no problems either in skin irritation or aroma.

I like how lightweight it is and how easy it spreads. It is really moisturizing but it is not slick or greasy. After application, I found that my socks were not stained or soiled by having it on my feet.

This is not as thick as some other foot creams, which may be a plus for you as the ""richer"" and thicker ones can often be a bit of overkill.

This product reminds me, somewhat, as a more contemporary and lightweight version of a foot cream I got from the Pharmacie de Santa Marie Novella in Florence a few years ago. That cream is unbelievably effective, but also unbelievably expensive. I'm glad to have found this product, which seems to work as well, if not better, than what was my favorite foot cream.

This cream is especially welcome for use in hot weather. Some others just feel too heavy on your skin but this feels cooling and comforting.

(If our microwave had not died, I would have tried heating it slightly to see how it works when it's warmed up!)",1443657600,2015-10-01
4.0,"This works really well, but leaves a slight residue for a while.

My hands are a little dry with extra dryness around my index fingers.  Jack Black Industrial Strength Hand Healer has left my hands feeling soft and beautiful.  Although I'm not really excited about the eucalyptus scent, it isn't long lasting.

The Jack Black cream is thick!  It goes on easily, but takes a while to absorb.  I usually start with the product on the backs of my hands, give them a good rubbing, and then wipe my palms off on a towel.  After a short while, the product has absorbed into the backs of my hands and I can immediately feel an improvement to my skin.

While this product is intended for men, it works just as well for women with dry hands, too.",1444694400,2015-10-13

5.0,"While a month is really to short to verify lasting effects, this does seem to have a very nice immediate effect on appearance (as does any good moisturizer). The instructions say to apply in the morning with a sunscreen, but I found daytime application to be too drying for my dry and somewhat sensitive skin. I later read that dermatologists strongly recommend against daytime use of retinols, even with sunscreen, as they enhance the damaging properties of uv exposure, but they're very safe and effective at night (still use sunscreen in the day when using this product, as it will increase your overall uv sensitivity). After I switched to night use, combined with a good moisturizer (but not an anti-aging moisturizer, because I want to get a sense of whether this is working on its own), the dryness and sensitivity disappeared.

This spreads and absorbs really well, so a little goes a long way, but you do need a normal face cream aw well, since it's a targeted treatment and not an overall moisturizer.",1455667200,2016-02-17
4.0,"This is a review by my mother, transcribed by me:

I like this machine, though I haven't been using it for more than 3 weeks so its long-term effectiveness is an unknown.  It's easy to operate and although it feels strange at first (tingling and facial muscle movement), I found it wasn't uncomfortable or annoying.  The headset is narrow; it's possible my head is a little larger than the average woman but I found it a little tight.  The gel pads are sticky (be careful applying new pads to the headset so that they don't fall face down onto another surface -- they are difficult to pry off) and stay right where you place them.

The instruction manual is clear about where you're to place the headset but it could be clearer as to the initial settings, i.e. effectiveness, comfort, timing of exercises, etc.  The beginning setting I chose is 26 and increased it slightly every few days.  The display is easy to understand except for an error message which I found at the back of the manual and I appreciate the separate Left and Right controls for the two sides of the face.

I don't notice any difference thus far except a feeling of slight firmness in my upper cheeks.  So, it seems to be working.  A 20-minute regimen each day isn't a hardship and the headset fits over the back of the neck, so I can do other things while it's working.

I will update this review if I have anything more to add in the coming weeks.  I will need to buy more pads but thus far, I like this product!",1419811200,2014-12-29

4.0,"When this arrived, the dryer smelled pretty bad. I hadn't even turned it on yet but I kept picking up an electrical/burning scent. It filled my bathroom when I put it in there, so I was skeptical to turn it on and use it. The first few times I used the dryer, it smelled, but gradually declined. My thought was maybe it just needed to be broken in. Although it wasn't a good impression (having read previous reviews w/ electrical problems), I am loving it now. It's very soft to the touch, easy to use and dries my hair pretty quickly. I was using an old conair dryer that finally died, so I was happy to upgrade. There are 3 temperature settings which I like, and I don't think the ""Hot"" gets so hot that it burns your head, hair and leaves you seeing smoke. It is a little heavy as previous reviews have mentioned, but I don't find that it is difficult to hold for the couple minutes I am using it. I never had a problem w/ frizz, so I can't speak to that. I don't notice any additional damage to my hair, and that's all that matters to me. I am just enjoying the couple minutes my long hair takes to dry using this, versus several minutes with other dryers. It's also quieter than my last dryer as well. Overall, I am liking this dryer a lot and would purchase again.",1463097600,2016-05-13

4.0,"I have thick, mid-length, coarse, curly hair. Hairspray is an essential part of my daily routine. Finding a spray that holds, isn't sticky, won't weigh down my style, and not smell like bug spray can be a challenge. This Calista Tools product does pretty well.

Breaking it down:

Hold - 5 out of 5 stars - My hair still looks good the next morning, and I am not a light sleeper. A little curl refresher, and I am good to go.

Stickiness - 3 out of 5 stars - Calista Tools Embellish Volume Finishing Spray can be a bit sticky upon application. The trick is to hold it far enough away from your head, then let it dry before fixing your style, and respraying. This is NOT a styling spray.

Weight - 5 out of 5 stars - The product is lightweight, but with a heavy hold. Once it dries, my hair moves naturally, but doesn't lose the style.

Smell - 3 out of 5 - While it doesn't smell like bug spray, it doesn't smell great. Not awful, but not great.

Shine - Adds shine, which is great for those of us with thick, coarse hair.

Bottom line - I really like the hold, the shine, and the weight of the product. 4 out of 5 stars, overall",1505692800,2017-09-18

4.0,"I purchased this product because it is medical grade toner for oily and acne prone skin.  It has only 2% salycilic acid, but it feels much stronger.  I use this toner in the morning and at night after cleansing the skin.  It definitely controls oil production and keep skin blemish free.  I used to be devoted to Obagi products, but ever since I finished my esthetics licensure, I am finding myself drawn to try other medical grade products.  One of the biggest competitors in medical grade products with this line is Neocutis and IS Clinical.  I Love Neocutis skin care and IS sunscreen products.  Obagi has unfortunate fallen down the list.  Still good products, but when it comes to the price, I am convinced that there are others that are price competitive and superior in quality.  I will still buy Obagi if I find a good deal, but unfortunately it is no longer my first choice.  I would still recommend products from this line to anyone.",1433116800,2015-06-01

Not sure if she will repurchase, but at least for now it offers an easy solution for bald spots.

A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load.

4.0,"I tried this out on my husband and it was something he liked. It's not like a greasy moisturizer at all. It reminds me of Smashbox's Skin Primer that I use under foundation.  After a shave, it felt really nice on his skin. Since he doesn't use anything on his skin normally, not even sunscreen, I've been trying to get him to do better. We are middle-aged now and need the help. I've given him a multitude of products that he ignores. He doesn't like the greasy feel or shine.

This fit the bill perfectly.

It does contain ""cones"" or those ingredients some people hate and consider them bad for their skin. I've not had a problem with them. It aids to that smooth feeling. Ingredient list below.  It's for sensitive skin and it is very concentrated so a pea-sized drop did his whole face.

Initially I was using it on my arms and legs, but decided to discontinue doing that since those parts of my body are rarely exposed and I wasn't seeing any benefit from the lotion. Since the lotion is rather costly, I decided that I would continue to use it only on my neck and upper chest area. The saggy skin on my neck does appear to be slightly smoother and feels moist and soft, though still saggy - the lotion doesn't purport to fix that problem! I really like the citrusy scent and thick texture of the lotion. A little goes a long way, so I will continue to use it on my neck daily to moisturize and plump up the loose skin on my neck. Like others, I find the product name, Crepe Erase, to be rather off-putting, and believe that the manufacturer should consider another name.

5.0,"This cream is so amazing I am willing to forgive the silly delivery system and inelegant jar. Simply twist off the top of the little purple ""pearl"" housing a dollop of cream and spread on your face. The cream is white and has no discernible odor. It absorbs immediately and leaves skin feeling smooth and moistand looking fresh and dewy. Even my 86 year ld mother loved it. Her skin is drier than the Sahara and although she has few wrinkles she does have deep laugh lines. Although there was no noticeable difference in the lines (to be fair it has only been a week) her skin looks and feels better than it has in year. So this cream is definitely a keeper.

I find the capsule system rather silly. I use Elizabeth arden ceramide capsules occasionally and they too come in capsules reportedly to prevent oxidation. Unlike those, however, these actually ar easy to open . Some of the cream makes it way out of the opening. But it doesn't spill and you don't lose any. On one hand  I suppose it is nice to have the proper amount divvied up but on the other hand faces and needs differ. Today one capsule may be sufficient but tomorrow you might need more. there are sixty capsules in the jar and the capsule form is not a deal breaker.

The jar is decidedly inelegant. Plain glass with a silver metal screw on cap, it is plain. And not in the minilalist chic way but plain in the ""i got a lot of these for cheap at Big Lots"" way. It is functional, easy to open but certainly no collector's item. But again the product is sufficiently impressive that I am happy to overlook the lack of packaging niceties. The labels  match the jar in lack of design. Even worse they are hard to read with small,
light gray print. In the end it is what is on the inside that counts. In this case, the cream is simply amazing.",1483142400,2016-12-31

8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)

I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.
I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

  1. DERMABLEND COVER CRME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF):
This is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.

My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  I hadnt read the instructions yet.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have dry patches on spots.  Now I get it!  This particular crme has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  This product is soft and smooth.  It appeared to be a very thin product at first, and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it.  It is lovely.

If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections; and when I apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleam in the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.

The other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.  She has said that even in my home with shades closed I am exposing my skin to potential damage.  I score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

The two colors I have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored LOreal Dermablend Pro products with them.

Ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF):
needed. The wonderful crmes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, with the cotton puffs. It hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the crme, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, since Amazon is not going to know my exact skin color, I have experimented, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using the various loose powder shades together:
 Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose.

A. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of crme I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.

B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000%! For me.

I have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally; and not necessarily all over my face and neck.
U have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough, though you may find it unnecessary; you can still have a dimensional look.

I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend crme applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.

One thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.

3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF):
These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  The mist isn't as fine as I had expected, but it works for me.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple for me.

4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF):
This a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the varying built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Crme, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

Not only can I spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. I also can add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. Win-Win-Win.

5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF):
This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  I do know that is stretching it though. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional Liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!

6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF):
Wow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have. Double win with this product results!

This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much. I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this Quick Fix product first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, look, only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through.  This is my personal preference.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. I love it.

7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25):
It is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.  It just didn't muss up and rub off.

8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)
This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Crme, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn, as my dermatologist has warned about.  I have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot.  This covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000%, and very smart.

Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!",1499040000,2017-07-03

4.0,"At 42, I'm a bit younger than the target market for this product, but I love skincare products and L'Occitane, and so eagerly picked this up as part of the Vine program.  I've been using it now for about a month (I wanted to give it time to work), and am impressed with how lovely this makes my skin.

When you first open the box it comes in, be sure to check the corner of the box for the small application spatula that is tucked away in a fold of the corner.  The spatula makes for a more hygienic application since you don't have to dip your fingers into the jar and risk the possibility of introducing bacteria into the cream.  (Of course, Paula Begoun mentions that skin creams and lotions should really be in tubes so that the product ingredients don't oxygenate and lose their potency; the spatula doesn't help avoid that issue, but at least it makes things more sanitary.)

Because this cream is thick and because I use a lotion with SPF during the day, I've only been using this at night.  I spread it on over my Retin-A, and it helps keep my skin supple and moist.  I don't think that it has made my fine lines any less noticeable, but it helps alleviate the dryness and peeling that my Retin-A sometimes leaves in its wake.

I have sensitive, oily skin, and appreciate that this is also non-comodogenic, so it won't clog pores or cause pimples.

It's a lovely luxury product that makes your skin feel silky smooth!",1403136000,2014-06-19

The reason for the 1 star reduction is that I think it feels a bit chalky, almost like there is flour in it.

5.0,"I've waited a bit to write this review.  I've got a good size bald/thinning spot on the crown of my head.  A couple of months ago I decided to try Toppik after my barber recommended it.  It has taken a while to get the routine down and learn to apply it just right.  I've been very happy but yesterday proved to me what a great product this is.  I never told anyone what I was doing.  People kept asking me if I had just gotten a haircut.  They knew something had changd, but couldn't figure out what it was.

Yesterday I was out for a walk qith my partner of 30 years and a friend.  While I was walking in front of them my partner said ""What did you do to your hair?""  I cringed.  I thought that he had noticed that I had put something on it and it showed.  I aksed him what he meant.  He said that my bald spot was gone.  He then got right up on top of me and looked at my hair.  He could not tell what I had done, but my bald spot was gone.  My friend touched it and said that it was soft.  If I could fool them I could fool anyone.  Even looking for it they couldn't tell.

Like I said, it took a bit to get the application down just right.  This should not discourage you, you just need a little practice. I wash my hair, blow dry it and apply the Toppik, using a hand mirror to see the back.  I use the Toppik until I get good coverage, brush it and then use a light spray of Tresseme hairspray.  It kind of seals it on the hair and keeps everything in place, but it is not stiff.  Most days this is just a minute or so.  You don't need to blowdry if you just let your hair dry naturally, but don't use the Toppik on wet hair.  I think that it would clump.  Also the blow dryer give the hair a bit of volume which helps.

Give it a try!",1264982400,2010-02-01

5.0,"Highlighters and concealers are often used in the same manner to describe a cosmetic product. I have used  concealer for years. I apply it after using foundation to provide some highlighting down the bridge of my nose, in the corner of my eyes and under my eyes. It works well for me. I was delighted to try this new Japonesque Eyelighter.

There seem to be three colors and color number two works for me. I have light to fair skin. I turned the dial at the bottom of the stick to open up the  Eyelighter. It took four or five turns to start the process. Then, using the brush, I applied a small amount under my eyes. I tapped the area so that the highlighter was almost transparent. I then applied a small amount to the bridge of my nose and above my lips. The highlighter is creamy and easy to disperse. Throughout the day, the highlighter stayed put, it did not leave a white glare under my eyes, but a gentle illumination. It does exactly what it claims do to. This highlighter is at a good price, and I would recommend it to anyone.

This is a nice system consisting of a cleanser, astringent and moisturizer. They don't all have to be used every day but I'm sure that the benefits are greater if you follow the system as recommended. The cleanser is nice, nothing too harsh and not too drying. The astringent has a mild mint scent but it is really hard to smell. The moisturizer is thick and blends in quickly.

I know that some say this is a great set for women too but I think it is designed for men and should, for the most part, be used by men. It seems to be a little stronger and the moisturizer a little too thick for the average daily use for women.",1393718400,2014-03-02

Clarisonic have a multitude of brush heads with various textures for different skin problems so it's important that you choose the right one. This brush head is specifically designed for deep pore cleansing. It does a great job but it will probably be too rough for sensitive skin.

I'm a big fan of Clarisonic, it does wonders for my face. I use the deep pore brush head almost every day, and my skin feels a lot smoother. I get fewer blackheads - I'm not saying they are completely gone but there is definitely a noticeable difference.

3.0,The only nail polish that lasts on my nails. Highly recommended. The only problem is that it takes a while to dry and I often end up messing them up and If you keep it on your nails too long (two weeks) it is extremely hard to take off worn makeup remover,1489536000,2017-03-15
3.0,"When I first seen the Baxter of California Hydro Salve lip balm, it immediately reminded me of Bath and Body Work's C.O. Bigelow line. The packaging and font, etc are almost identical. I also didn't realize that the Baxter line is marketed directly to men. First me say that my husband would never use this product. It's lip balm but leaves a pretty high sheen on your lips like a lip gloss does. This is definitely not Chap Stick. I will gladly use it but to wear this, you have to be the kind of person that wants to look like you have lip gloss on.

This is listed as mojito flavor but I didn't think it had any flavor but I do smell a lime and mint scent to it. It does goes on a clear.

If you're interested in a high quality and natural lip balm then I suggest Burt Bee's or the C.O. Bigelow instead. They are both cheaper and I just like them better. If you are interested in this because it's marketed to men, I think the high gloss of the product kind of cancels that out.",1379030400,2013-09-13

5.0,"This was the first body lotion by LOccitane (I have bought their soap bars) that I tried and I do like it a lot! Its not a thick lotion but it is effective. The small cap lifts up and the lotion comes out easily, especially in the beginning - I found that it almost pours out if Im not careful. I was on a 3 week cruise and had forgotten to bring my lotion with me. This prompted me to go to the shop on the ship to find something to use and that would soothe my sunburned skin. This was very good and it has a pleasant but not strong scent of roses. It does not take a lot of lotion to cover the entire body which justifies the price - a little goes a long way. Since Ive been home I have ordered this one from Amazon and I still have a little left of their cherry blossom body lotion left before I reorder another one. Again this is a body milk and the consistency is similar as opposed to some of the other brands of lotions - for example the ones by Molton Brown which I was using throughout the winter and is much thicker in texture.",1532476800,2018-07-25
4.0,"Dermablend Quick-Fix Body Full Coverage Foundation Stick is a great addition to my makeup bag for a special event. A full coverage, water-, transfer- and smudge-resistant stick foundation that glides on smoothly to conceal tattoos and body imperfections on smaller surfaces. When dressing up for a wedding or company event, I tend to cover up my birthmark on my shoulder as it is a little large and I feel self conscious about it. So I was very excited to try this out as I have never used a just for the body concealer.

Very easy to use, glide over area and blend well into skin. Cover with a setting powder- I use Bare Minerals- and will stay on for almost 16 hours. Now my birthmark is a light color so I had no trouble blending and hiding it but I do think if you where to try to conceal a dark tattoo, you might have a little trouble as I do think the colors still make come through.

Another plus, we recently went swimming and I used this on certain parts of my legs to cover up veins or other small imperfections and after a full day in the water it showed no signs of rubbing off. I was thrilled as I tend to be shy about my legs.

My review is more like 4.5 stars as I do wish it provided more coverage for darker tattoos.",1499212800,2017-07-05

1.0,"My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product! Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place.",1339286400,2012-06-10

My hands are always a wreck because I'm a nurse and either washing or cleansing them all day. It has a light, pleasant scent and absorbs quickly. I don't have dark spots so I can't give an opinion. The main reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the price. I have used this twice a day since I received the product so I could give a fair review. If I was as diligent in using an $8 lotion I feel I would get similar results. So if you have 50 extra bucks to blow it is a great lotion.",1523145600,2018-04-08

Living in a hot, humid climate, this product arrived in my mailbox in a very warm state.  As such it was very thin and has remained that way.

One treatment of this does smooth fine lines and wrinkles and has an added moisturizing effect.

The way I use it is over my moisturizer.  It does not stay sticky and does not make skin appear oily or shiny.

It can be rinsed off after 1, 2 or 3 hours depending on the depth of the tan you prefer. She did not rinse it at all and applied it after showering and loved the result. There was no odor upon application. The mousse is a brown color and was applied with gloves and there was no residue color on them. She did not apply it with her bare hands, so cannot say whether the color would transfer to fingernails etc. I would recommend a tanning mitt. The formula was not greasy and dried quickly. You do not need to use much so the 6.7 fl oz. will last for many uses. She has used other self-tanners in the past and was very pleased with this product.",1528243200,2018-06-06

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

The body mist feels cool when you first spray it, but unfortunately that sensation does not last.  We are deep into Summer now, it would of been an added bonus. The scent lasts at least several hours after you apply it.  It's hard to read the back of the box, but you can also spray it on your bedding too.

For me it's kind of hard to describe the scent which is supposed to be Indian Rose and Himalaya Honey, but I will say that whatever it is keeps me wanting to smell it throughout the day.  In the end isn't that what you want a body mist to do?  The scent is there but it's not overpowering, which I hate. I want to smell it, I don't want to drown in it!",1531440000,2018-07-13

I like that the moisturizer is very gentle to sensitive skin. It doesn't cause my skin to break out. Neither does it appear to clog the pores. However, it is marketed as a day cream but it doesn't contain any sunscreen. You may want to consider a separate sunscreen on top of it. Other than that, it's an excellent moisturizer.

4.0,"One to two pumps is all you need for full coverage of your face and neck. This potion is very smooth and silky going on, and covers very well.  Almost like it's skimming along the surface of your skin more so than being absorbed by it, although after a bit of time it seems to be 'in' the skin. It has a pleasant scent, but does leave a slightly sticky residue on your hands and face. (Very noticeable as flakes on the skin if too much product is used.)

The product's website details this product in the following way:

""This powerful, dual-action anti-aging serum helps visibly lift skin and acts as a non-invasive line filler to help temporarily smooth out the look of fine lines and wrinkles. It contains a rare, exclusive orchid extract which comes from the Emerald Coast of France and is designed to enhance natural production of healthy collagen and elastin in the skin.""

It's part of a skin care line that if used regularly promises amazing results. Unfortunately I don't have the entire line to try out, but this 'filler' - used to temporarily smooth fine lines and wrinkles - is a good product from my brief usage of it. It does add a moisturized layer to the skin; especially around the eyes, that gives the skin a plumper appearance.  Used underneath my mineral make-up, I noticed a subtle, positive difference.

I do get a slight blotchy redness right after applying it, and some very minor tingling.  This does disappear rather quickly though. I think using less is actually better and it may not be necessary to smooth it all over your face as much as the areas around your neck, mouth and eyes.

This product is expensive by comparison to other products I've used and I look forward to giving it at least 30 days to work its magic. Ideally I would use it for 3 months, but I'm not sure there's that much product in this 1 fl oz bottle.  I'll definitely update this review the longer I use the product to let Amazon shoppers know my experience with it over an extended period of time.

--------------------------------------

UPDATE:  7/18/16 - After a month of consistent use I can say this product works very well to make my whole face and neck feel moisturized.  My skin seems plumper - more elastisity - and does seem to make the appearance of fine lines (especially around my eyes) significantly less noticable.

This stuff is really remarkable in the sense that it takes one pump (very small amount) to get full coverage.  My 49 year old skin is generally fairly dry so I was afraid this product would be sucked in never to be seen again.  Much to my delight it went on silky smooth, with no oily residue.

The inital red, blotchy skin reaction I got when I used it went away within a week of use. Maybe my skin got used to it?  Really smooth applicaiton with no tingling after two weeks of use.

On the downside, it's not ideal with mineral make-up.  What generally had a matte appearance became more 'oily' looking. Perhaps it was the timing of the application of my makeup, but I always tried to apply these two products at least 1 hour apart to give it time to absorb.  Despite this, I would continue to use it. It's not a miracle cream, but it is very good!  I still have product in the bottle after 1 month which is truly surprising to me.

4.0,"I love this deodorant.  It really does work for 24 hours.. longer, really.  It is pretty easy to apply once you get the hang of the applicator.  It is still an aluminum-based product, but there seems to be a lot less chemical-based agents aside from that than your typical deodorant.  It is not yet listed on the EWG Skin-Deep database, but when it is, I'll be looking it up ASAP.  If this really is a healthier iteration of a functional deodorant, I will gladly spend the additional cost.

My only hesitations are these:
-- Even though it says it is non-marking, it absolutely is.  Take care to let it dry/soak in before putting on clothes... not too long, but just a minute or two.  And take care with letting dark colors rub over the underarms... the deodorant will show up and need to be cleaned off.
-- The nature of the tube will inevitably cause issues as the tube starts to empty, and create waste.  For this price, I will for sure open up the tube and apply in another way... but I'm not really looking forward to that.

5.0,"I have sensitive skin with occasional eczema outbreaks when my skin comes into contact with harsh cosmetics.  A lot of facial cleansers and makeup removers leave my skin either irritated or so oily that it reacts.  Not this Vichy Miceller Waterversion.  It contains no alcohol, yet feels as refreshing as a traditional astringent -- without the drying.  My skin feels both soft and clean afterward.  I love that I can use it around my eyes without its prompting an eczema outbreak.

I apply this cleanser using flat cotton rounds.  That way, I can minimize the fibers on my face and around my eyes.  I don't have to rub -- the dirt comes right off with a swipe.  This is soooo much better than the L'Oreal Micellar Water cleanser I've used in the past.

2.0,"Of the multiple products in the Meaningful Beauty line that I have tried this Vitality Oil is my least favorite. The scent is a bit heavier than the other products, but that in itself doesnt bother me, I actually enjoy stronger scents. My issue with the oil is that unlike other oil products that I have tried it feels like oil, it sits on top of my skin and feels greasy and sticky. During the time I was trying to use the product daily to test out its effectiveness, my breakouts increased noticeably. My skin can be difficult; it is sensitive, combination and does have issues absorbing many moisture products. I do take into consideration the issues my skin has when I make judgments on a product. Overall even with my skin problems I did not like this product, the heaviness and greasy feel is just not something I look for in my skin care and the additional breakout made me want to hide my skin not show it off.",1490659200,2017-03-28
5.0,"I REALLY like this scent.  Or combination of scents.  It's a little bit sweet, a little leather and spice, and a refreshing change from most other male fragrances.

When you put this on your first whiff is of alcohol.  That vanishes, of course, and what is left is a nicely leveled fragrance. By which I mean that it doesn't change from what it is when you spray it on to something more flowery later.  It smelled good after 60 seconds and stayed smelling good for hours.

Which brings up the stench-factor.  I hate scents that are knock-you-out strong.  I'm scent sensitive so I and the family need to use perfumes and such in moderation.  This is very nice. Lasts well without having to douse yourself.

RECOMMEND.  If you are looking for a new male fragrance this is one to definitely try.  I loved the scent and my husband and the teens did too.  (Teengirl is borrowing it.)",1458086400,2016-03-16

4.0,"Summer is here, which means I need to amp up my SPF. I use sunscreen on my face year-round (usually a moisturizer with SPF15) and right now I'm using Coola Cucumber Moisturizing Face Sunscreen in SPF 30.

I have combination/oily skin that tends to get even slicker during the warm summer months. I also have very pale skin that tends to burn when exposed to the sun for even a short amount of time. I prefer a face sunscreen that isn't greasy

Coola Cucumber Sunscreen SPF 30 is a thin white colored cream. It has a moderately strong cucumber scent that dissipates shortly after application. It's a nice change of pace from the tropical fragrances you can encounter with other sunscreens

The active ingredients in Coola Cucumber Sunscreen are Avobenzone (2%) and Octinoxate (2.1%).

I use this in the mornings after washing my face. It absorbs well and I'm on to the rest of my morning routine. Coola says you'll be sun-ready in 30 minutes (as with most sunscreens) and that you should reapply every two hours. Most days I wear makeup, so reapplication of a goopy sunscreen isn't going to happen--but then most days my sun exposure is limited. I have noticed that my limited sun has resulted in a tan on my un-sunscreened flip-flopped feet, so I'm sure to put my face sunscreen on every morning.

I like a moisturizer with SPF and I would use this weekdays (when I'm mostly inside) and weekends when I'm out and about.  I find it hard to judge the effectiveness of a sunscreen until it fails for me and I try not to leave myself exposed to sunscreen failure. I'm happy with the Coola Cucumber for my current lifestyle.  The moisturizer is light and absorbs well into my skin.",1404604800,2014-07-06

This product does leave a little of the natural oils, but still will dry your skin because of the nature of the cleanser. The microbeads are just firm enough to do away with the days dirt and surface debris. In the few weeks that I have used it, I have noticed that my skin looks brighter and more radiant than previously, as promised by the TrueFirm Complex ingredient. All in all, it is a much better cleanser than the more popular commercial products. To top it off, it has a nice gentle scent that is not too fragrant and not too citrusy. Has a nice flower smell that is pleasing to the senses. Only tip is to buy a moisturizer to use after using this to maintain your skins optimum moisture.",1459555200,2016-04-02

The foamy mask can be used many times, there was quite a bit there for a sample size.  I found the wipe was so saturated that it could be used 2 or 3 times if you closed the package tightly.  There also seemed to be enough moisturizer in each of the two packages for at least two uses.  I didn't really see any benefit from the mask.  The moisturizer was nice.  What I loved, and will purchase separately, was the peel.  The peel is fantastic!  I could see improved clarity by the second use (I used every other day) and after 5 uses big improvement in clarity of skin.

I'm pretty sure that men can use this product as well as sun does not discriminate. If you use a small dab amounts, it should last you for some time.

5.0,"This is the most extraordinary hair product I've come across in a long time.  I first used it on wet hair and then blow dried and gave me a very smooth blowout.  I used a few drops afterwards and it made my hair gleam.  And then I read the reviews, a number of which said to try it on dry hair.  So that's what I did.  I used two pumps in the morning and it made my hair look really greasy so I was all set to wear my hair in an updo that day.  But after I put on my makeup, which took about 20 minutes, my hair looked absolutely gorgeous!  It was soft and shiny and the ends were didn't look dry at all.  I proceeded to use the curling iron, as I usually do (the oil has heat protection up to 500 degrees) and my hair had body and bounce and looked fantastic!  So the next morning I did the same thing but used three pumps and I got the same great results.  I've done this every day for a month and it's like I have a different head of hair.  My hair is heavily highlighted so breakage and dryness are always issues.  But the keratin in this oil has made my hair so much stronger that I no longer have any breakage at all.  And dryness is a thing of the past.  Before, my ends looked like straw and now they are supple and lay nice and flat and smooth.  When I first apply the oil, my hair does look greasy, but that goes away in about 15-20 minutes.  My hair absorbs the oil and looks and feels like virgin hair.  It's the most amazing thing!  If your hair is dry and damaged, this treatment will restore it and make it healthy looking again.  And you can use it daily without making it greasy or weighing it down.  I use 3 to 4 pumps and distribute the oil to the last 3 or 4 inches, concentrating on the ends.  And I no longer have to worry about heat styling because this oil is an excellent heat protectant.  It can be used over styling products or hairspray too.  I've tried other oils, like argan, and they only sit on top and don't really soak in and end up making my hair an oily mess and weighing it down.  This oil soaks in completely and definitely doesn't weigh it down and is very lightweight.  It also smells amazing.  I don't know what oils are in this potion because the print on the bottle is too tiny to read, but whatever they are, they are amazing!!  I will use this oil forever and will tell everyone I know how awesome it is.  You can try this oil on damp hair but if you don't get the expected awesome results, try it on dry hair.  In the last month my hair has gone from frazzled and fried to nourished, supple and shiny.  It's an amazing transformation.  I highly recommend this awesome oil.  There's simply nothing in the world like it.",1452297600,2016-01-09
5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

The list of ingredients include shea butter and mango butter.  That probably explains the thickness of the product.

This 1.7 ounce pump style container will not last long as it's simply not a large amount of product.  It's called ""Hydrate"" but I don't see how all these heavy butters and gums can hydrate my face.

Glycolix Elite Treatment Pads not only deliver dramatic results it is the best skin care product I have ever used. First of all it cost pennies a day to use this product. You only need one pad to totally cover your face, neck and hands. So, one jar lasts 2 months--in which time your skin looks years younger. The main ingredient is doctor strength 20% Glycolic Acid which has been medically proven to exfoliate skin, reducing fine lines, blemishes and never tone. You see results in just a day or so. I use it at night rubbing really hard to get all the dirt, oil and dead skin off. You can see the pad turn brown after. Then, I use a good moisturizer like Vitamin C serum and go to bed. In the morning skin looks incredible and with daily use it just looks better and better day by day week by week. One note of caution: If you have sensitive skin and have been reactionary to any similar products in the past I suggest you start out with 10% Otherwise, use this every other day or every third day till your skin gets used to it.",1454457600,2016-02-03

On one application, it burned a little and I don't have sensitive skin. I tried it with and without makeup. I didn't see a difference in how my face looked except for one thing. My make up didn't look shiny, so it did its job as a matte.

The make up didn't last longer than when I use any other primer. A few people made comments on the size of the primer tube. I haven't seen many primer products in a larger tube.

I also found this formula on the dry pasty side, and while it may sometimes be the only product that works, it is not a pleasure to work with.

This moisturizer has a light and pleasant smell and went on smoothly and evenly to my slightly wet face.  My skin absorbed the lotion and felt clean and refreshed, not in any way irritated.  I was pleased with the initial results and several hours later my skin continued to feel good.

This stuff is expensive.  Is it worth it?  Remember, I only used a dime shaped dollop of lotion on my face so I think the tube will last for months.

It's a bit smaller than you might expect at 5"" -- unless portability is key you might consider shopping for a larger size. It's an attractive, translucent orange/tortoisehell cellulose, and the manufacturing quality is very good, with crisp rounded edges and a nice weight in the hand.  It feels good to use and looks much nicer than plastic, even if it's functionally identical to any cheaper comb. Still, the short length and split coarse/fine teeth make it a little harder to use, especially on longer hair, than a longer model or one with the same teeth all the way across like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speert-s-10/dp/B001M5GS7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speert's #10</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kent-s/dp/B000YB1XRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kent's</a>.",1391126400,2014-01-31

4.0,"I have oily, acne prone skin. As a result, I'm very cautious with sunblocks, most of them just break me out terribly.

This Anthelios sunblock is SPF 60, and significantly cheaper than the Murad, so I gave it a try. My initial impression when putting it on for the first time was how thick it was. I thought ""oh crap, this is going to break me out"". It was definitely thick and hard to blend in without ending up with white streaks on the face. I'm pale, so once blended in, I didn't notice much of a white cast. Because it's oil free, it absorbed into the skin quickly and wasn't greasy at all, which was definitely a plus. I wore it every day for a week to see if it would cause me to break out, and I was pleasantly surprised when it did not. What did surprise me, however, was that my skin got very dehydrated and dried out, which isn't usually a problem for me.

This is definitely not a perfect facial sunblock. It's thick, hard to blend in, and dries out my skin. Because of that, I can't recommend it for daily use. For my everyday, holy grail sunblock, I'm sticking with the Murad. That said, on days when I know I'm going to be out in the sun a good bit, I'll use the Anthelios due to it having the higher SPF 60. Despite the negatives, I only took away one star because this did not break me out, which is nothing short of a small miracle when it comes to SPF.",1464048000,2016-05-24

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

5.0,"This doesn't just remove makeup from brushes. When I was done applying all the layers, I needed to clean off the counter top as well. Without thinking, I just sprayed some of the brush cleaner onto the counter, and that came clean rather quickly too. Granted, this is rather expensive for using on counters regularly, but if you can't find your makeup removal cloths, it will do the trick.

Spray some onto your dirty brush, and run the brush across a towel. Why is this handy? Because sometimes you need to clean your brushes to re-use them for something else, and don't have time to wait to do a full water cleaning. Also, with some of my more expensive brushes, I'm not to keen on cleaning them with soap and water, because I don't want the fibres to get damaged by anything.

All in all, in spite of the cost, I think it's worth it to have a bottle of this stuff in your arsenal.",1459987200,2016-04-07

3.0,"This lotion works about as well as any other lactic/glycolic acid treatment I've used, no better or worse. It has the same amount of drying I'd expect, as well as the same level of exfoliation after a few weeks of use. I do find that the slightly medicinal smell is unpleasant, but that fades quickly. It soaks in quickly and only leaves a slight residue on skin, which is much less noticeable after applying moisturizer. I haven't experienced any irritation while using it once daily (morning) under moisturizer and sunscreen. It also doesn't affect my makeup application at all.

For the price, I admit I had higher expectations for skin clarity and overall brightness of my complexion. The results after several weeks are just... meh. I can't really tell I've been using it, other than my skin feels drier. In my super-arid climate, dry skin is more of a problem than a benefit.

Maybe a lactic/glycolic acid treatment can't be improved on much beyond basic exfoliation, but this new line did seem to promise better than average results. For the money, I'll go back to my favorite REN Glycol Lactic Radiance mask twice a week, or the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha/Beta Peel. Or I'll switch back to retinol products (Peter Thomas Roth has one that's great), which seem to do a much better job for anti-aging and overall brightening without drying, even though this claims to be ""specially formulated to help transform the appearance of aging skin.""",1487203200,2017-02-16

I always do a double cleanse, usually with oil as step one, the cleanser then comes in as step two - I buy some pretty expensive cleansers, so doing a pre-cleanse removes all my makeup so that my skin can get the maximum effectiveness of other cleansers. So, this cleansing milk has a creamy texture that has an oily slip to it when rubbed. I don't waste it on a cotton ball, but instead apply directly to my skin and massage it in, then I rinse it off and use my next cleanser. It does leave skin soft and smooth, but I wouldn't advise not rinsing this product off. Simply follow with a deeper cleanser, tone, use serum, and moisturize.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

4.0,"Since most foundations have a maximum of 15 SPF rating its nice to know this skin renewal lotion amps that up to SPF 30.  Where I live in Southern California the sun can be brutal.  The texture of this cream is lightweight and a smal dot goes a long way and it adheres to your skin quickly.  As per the packaging warning there is a slight tingling feeling as you work it into your skin and because of this I hesitate to put it too near the more delicate area around my eyes.  (Im using a separate moisturizer for the under eye area).  Though the results aren't dramatic I can feel my skin plumping slightly.  Sometimes I use it on its own and other times I use it under my foundation.

It dispenses with a pump which makes it easy to control the flow so you can precisely get just a small amount so nothing is wasted.  This seems important since this product is not at a drugstore price point.

The best selection I've found so far or pale skin is Kat Von D, but that foundation is heavy coverage that looks a bit too much for my daytime look. I decided to try Dermablend Liquid Camo in Linen. It is an almost perfect foundation for someone as pale as me. It is almost exactly my skin tone, just a wee bit darker than Iike. Still, it is closer than most any other foundations on the market. It's fine for every day, especially when I put a lighter powder dusting. When dressing up, I'll mix a bit of the Kat Von D with it and it's perfect. It doesn't get cakey with my oily skin and lasts all day. It's buildable so you can get a heavier coverage when you want. It goes on very smoothly and doesn't feel heavy or greasy on my skin.

This has a thinner line, but you can go over it again to make it appear thicker and darker.

It didn't irritate my eyes as some eyeliners do.  And it doesn't collect in the corner of my eyes as other eyeliners do.

My only wish is that it sent on more smoothly, but then it might come off more easily.  So, that's a trade-off.  I haven't found an eyeliner which lasts as long as this one does, so if that's what you're looking for, this may be a 5-star product.",1512864000,2017-12-10

It absorbs fairly quickly without feeling greasy, and does a really good job of moisturizing.  This is definitely something I will be getting more of when it's gone. While the scent does seem a bit strong at first it does fade quite a bit after a while, but it does linger for a long time so if you are overly sensitive to scents and perfumes than Crabtree & Evelyn's products are probably not the best choice for you.",1457222400,2016-03-06

I hope it is going to be efficient to review all of the ones I know of here, and including compatible products along the way. Respectively:

I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.

I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

1. DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF):
This is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.

My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have sun spots. Now I get it.  This particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  It is lovely.

If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when I apply it with dab it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.

The other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.  She has said that even in my home with shades closed I am exposing my skin to potential damage.  I score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

The two colors I have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored LOreal Dermablend Pro products with them.

Ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF):
needed. The wonderful cr&egrave;mes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the cr&egrave;me, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using them together:

 Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose. A. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of cr&egrave;me I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr&egrave;me and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000 for me.

I have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself.
Pick your poison, as I have purchased some powder and cr&egrave;me blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.

I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.
One thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.

3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF):
These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple.

4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION!! (25 SPF):
This a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the variable built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Cr&egrave;me, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

Not only can I variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. This shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the cr&egrave;me, and the powders, I may experiment with altering the look as in 2A.  Win-Win-Win.  I also may add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.

5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF):
This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  I do know that is stretching it. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!

6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY!! (NO SPF):
Wow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have!  Double win!

This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which I won't feel shy about adding puffs of Dermablend Professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and I will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2A.  This is a lovely product.  I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. Love.

7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25):
It is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.

8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)
This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn.  It covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000, and very smart.

Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!

The LOreal Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  They earn being in a high-end category in my opinion. They do not seem to be scented or too chemical. The jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups. I have many favorites among them, yet I believe they all stand very well on their own.

I hope it is going to be efficient to review all of the ones I know of here, and including compatible products along the way. Respectively:

1. DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF):
2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF):
3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF):
4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF):

I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.
I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.
There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.
I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

1. DERMABLEND COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN!! (30SPF):
This is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.
My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have sun spots. Now I get it.  This particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  It is lovely.
If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when I apply it with dab it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.
The other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.",1499040000,2017-07-03
5.0,"Looks just like real hair! Okay, so let me start by saying that I had alopecia (not sure on the spelling) when I was in college. The hair on the sides of my head, right above my ears just thinned out and has never grown back. I always wear my hair down because it's easy to cover the spots with my curly hair. However, if I ever want to wear my hair up, I'm faced with exposing my 2-Half-Dollar-sized bald spots. I've colored in the spots before, but I go through those eye pencils way too quickly and they aren't exactly real looking. These Fibers are the first thing that has really allowed me to wear my hair up and look normal. Don't get me wrong, I'm still keeping an eye out for a hair growth miracle, but in the mean time, this will do. ;)

5.0,"I've been using this product over the summer in between applications of their other ""instant tan"" product (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00865610O). This product goes on clear and turn your skin brown over a few hours. I like it because it hold the brown longer when you combine it with their instant-tan product. It is brown, not orangey like old style products. I don't find it streaky at all as long as I take my time a rub onto small sections of my legs. The ingredients are high quality made in the U.K. I have even used this on my face occassionally to add a little kiss of the sun glow when I go out for the evening. I use it about once ever 1-2 weeks throughout the summer and still have a lot left in the container (a little goes a long way). i LOVE this product!",1475107200,2016-09-29
5.0,I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.,1467331200,2016-07-01

5.0,"While often people think of Julep as a nail polish brand they've also been branching into makeup and skincare in the last couple of years.  I've found the products to be hit or miss, but have generally really liked their lip products.  Those positive perceptions continued with these matte liquid lipsticks.

To start off with, the formula is excellent. It applies easily with the wand attached to the cap. It's very opaque, but creamier and more hydrating than other liquid lipsticks I've tried.  And it's long lasting so it's a great choice when you may not be able to reapply but still want it to last after eating and drinking. I also like these do not bleed or transfer so my lip line stays precise and distinct.  It also doesn't over-accentuate lip wrinkles!

I also surprised myself with this color.  I tend towards mauves, nudes, peaches, and purples.  I've always found red tricky to pull off.  But I find this deep cool red to be flattering to my blonde hair and neutral tones light/medium skin.

Overall I'm really liking this. I'm not yet convinced that Julep can do any product flawlessly, but their lip products definitely win me over.",1467417600,2016-07-02

A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol.

1.0,"September Update

Ultimately I was unable to continue using ANY of the products from JB. Emailed. The company is more interested in taking your $ and refuse to refund any of my purchases - even though I can't use any of them. So not only was I brushed off but I was outright told I could not get a refund even though they push clients to use the products passed the 45 day refund period. This company does not back their product. They will encourage you to use something else on their line OR continue using the acne kit, stating on the website, it can take several weeks (i.e. well over a month) to see if the ""purge"" will subside. A GOOD company would refund customers who are dissatisfied and having serious reactions to their products. I will warn you now, buy it, but be aware that getting a refund will be nearly impossible if your have problems.

********
Seems the good people at JB are too busy to address my issue with their product so I found it best to forewarn anyone thinking about trying this product of my experience thus far. I've been acne plagued for more than 2 count them 2 decades. I've tried everything with continued disappointment including anything my dermatologist recommended. I decided to get this on a whim and the first week or so it ""seemed"" to show improvement.

Now, many people say with a new product there may be a ""purging"" stage where the acne is cycling thru and eventually it'll leave you with better looking skin thereafter. So far my ""purge"" is the worst my acne has ever looked and is emerging in places I've never had acne. How can that be? One thing to tell me my regular acne or hidden acne will pop up faster during a purge, but explain the logic behind acne on parts of my face never seen? My face has been completely ravaged and I'm on my 2nd month.

When I posted something with JB hoping to get assistance, I got nothing, nana, zip. Seems they were just more happy to have suckered me into a 2nd month and didn't feel the need to help out someone who could potentially be a lifelong customer IF this horrible purge ever passes because I'm pretty determined. Instead, I'm left to assume it'll either get better in the next 30 days or I'll need to go to another product. If it improves I'll keep it - but as it's looking (which is pretty darn nasty at the moment) I'll likely employ their so-called return policy - again I just have to see if this purge is a myth or not. I've had similar breakouts, but nothing like this.

I've used this regime religiously - alas just getting worse for now - all over my forehead (never break out there), all over my jawline (painful, scarring red patches on both sides), all around my lips. I've pretty much had to cut out make up most days because it makes it look like scabbed, uneven pavement.

The product - ok, the facewash is good. Doesn't dry out your face the moment you towel it off. Smells kinda lemon-esk to me. Nothing to write home about - functional, more than enough to get you through several dozen washes. The serum - so far I'm not seeing any improvements related to the would-be acne fighter. A little goes a long way. The lotion is mighty sticky, weird, very oil-free - so much so it'll suck the surface of your skin dry. I find my face is oilier in the middle of the day using this regime. If it were really balancing it wouldn't be nearly like the oil slick that it is. I have to constantly blot my acne prone, combination skin with those oil-absorbing sheets. Didn't have to do that as often before.

I'm afraid by the time I finally ""grow out of"" my acne it'll be time for wrinkle cream. Anyway, overall the product seems fine - the only item out of the entire kit I'd repurchase at this point - considering I'm still in the dreaded purge - is the facial peel. I love the peel. I could just about eat it out of the jar. Again, I use it as recommended and it seems to help the acne (when applied at night). The morning after when I awake the acne appears diminished. Then a couple days later I have a whole new crop of white and red beauties to remind me this kit isn't working out very well. Be prepared to be snubbed by JB after they've gotten your money because that's how I feel.

I'll consider editing my review at the end of next month - I'll be officially through two whole months & we'll see where my face is then.

*****

August Update
Ultimately, I gave up using this kit other than the peel and the blemish clearing stick (which you'd buy separately). Only using up what I have left of the peel as I've found one made with similar ingredients for WAY less than what the standard jar costs. And ounce for ounce the stick isn't exceptional.

The products overall, I'm sad to say, never completely eliminated my problem: high cost - no real results. Had it, obviously I would be raving about it and not complaining about the cost (when you invest in the standard bottles). When will these companies get that if something really works people will happily pay for it - so long as it's reasonable? Anyway, I gave up on the all natural toner & have moved onto trying the Clinique acne kit in hopes it may slay my acne beast. But that's a new regime for me and thus I can't say for sure how it's going as of yet.

My JB purge was so damaging that my dark marks are still healing and I took a little break in-between the kits by washing with mild facewash and spot treating. Additionally, I developed noticeable blackheads which I'd never really had a problem with before JB.

Ideally, I'd like to think this JB kit could work for someone, but not if you have sensitive + oily skin. I'm assessing my ""purge"" was my skin reacting poorly to the product. However, many are vague as to how to distinguish between a reaction and a so called purge - if the purge actually exists, you know. Therefore, I suggest if you are breaking out in places you typically don't you may be having a poor reaction to something in the product. If you are an oil slick 30 days into ""testing"" a new regime, you're likely not acclimating to it well. That was the case for me anyway.",1369699200,2013-05-28

The lotion is ok, but even when applied as directed on slightly wet skin, it just doesn't seem to stay with you throughout the day as advertised.  I guess smell is a personal thing, but I really don't like the smell of this particular lotion... again, personal preference.  Regardless, even if I liked the aroma, it seems way overpriced compared to some of the other skin products I've tried.

First, Im impressed with the bottle that belies its quite affordable price. The multi-faceted vintage glass look prepared me for quality contents. I used it gingerly on my wrists and  for me  the top note was citrusy with a tart lemony and musky smell upon first application with a hint of bergamot. It settles in with a crisp and refreshing scent.

3.0,"I have become such a fan of micellar water products in the last few years, because they're a convenient way to cleanse and tone my face at the same time. I don't typically rely on this product as an everyday cleanser, but it is very helpful on occasion, especially for taking off stubborn eye makeup. Mascara in particular is no match for this brand, since one or two swipes with a cotton pad seems to do the trick. It's worth mentioning that the back of the bottle claims that it's safe for eyes, but that didn't hold true for me. I opened one eye accidentally for one second while applying this and it immediately stung. This is definitely not eye-friendly or at least it isn't for me.

With that being said, it is very friendly to sensitive skin. This is also alcohol free, so I didn't feel any drying effect that would typically occur with some of the other toners that I've used in the past. The only thing is that this product did leave my skin with a tacky feeling immediately afterwards. I didn't wash it off to see if the feeling would disappear. It took about a half hour, but the sticky, tackiness did eventually fade. I also didn't need to apply additional moisturizer or anything, thereafter. A huge plus is that this paraben free, which always gets a star in my book. The fragrance is one of my favorite aspects, because it reminds me a lot of rose water, which I love.  All in all, it's a decent product for convenient facial washing and toner. I do like how well it removes my makeup.

As for how it works, I do notice a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.  I have used more expensive products from L'Occitane with similar results so this is a good formulation at its price-point.

Based on results to date, I would order again.",1451088000,2015-12-26
4.0,"Gentle & hydrating, this moisturizer is creamy (not at all oily) and absorbs quickly & it really does improve the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes.
Rather than being in a tube, this eye cream comes in a pump.  One pump dispenses a little more than I need for both eyes.  I use the excess above my lips to help minimize the lines that come with age.
I am able to apply makeup soon after applying the cream and don't have any problems with  eye shadow 'creasing' on my lid.
 This eye cream helps with the fine lines around my eyes & gives my eyes a more youthful look.

Normally I like vanilla, honey, but I think the ginger note was too powerful for me. Again, it smells differently to everyone and also smells differently on everyone.

5.0,"I've used Oribe products before, so was  happy to review this. And have used this glaze before.  Very nice.  Use it about every other time you shampoo -- instead of conditioner. it is very thick and slick.  Use a very small amount; I have pretty long, thick hair and i'd say about a nickel size is good.  Leave in a few minutes on clean hair, rinse.  You'll be surprised on soft your hair is.  And leaves it shiny.  Was recommended to me originally from my hair stylist (sometimes I get a color glaze).  All Oribe products I've tried have been excellent.  Pricy -- but very good.  With most  you can use a little amount.

I have long hair that has been straightened; very thick and dry.  The de-tangling primer is also great - and the Royal blow out is really nice (for some reason my hair dries faster when I use that).  The conditioner is very very nice also.  and shampoos.  Note: there are different types for different types of hair.",1491523200,2017-04-07

3.0,"Confession: I wash my beard regularly. I scrub my skin, occasionally moisturize, and brush daily. So I was excited by the prospect of a beard oil tincture that promised to make my beard soft, smooth, and manageable. I would say by purported claims alone, the product is successful. My beard is tamer, softer, and looks better.

My issue is with the ""side effects"".  There are two.

1. Smell. The oil has a distinctive odor and it lingers all day. I've experimented with not applying to my moustache area but the smell persists, wafting up my nose. I thought I would get used to it, but it's kind of annoying and sickeningly sweet. Given its proximity to my nose, I was hoping for something a little more subtle. My advice is to use a single drop rather than a dime-sized amount.  Even then, the smell is powerful and persistent.

2. Flyaways. After a good brushing, my beard usually holds fast. After using the PBO I had a lot of stray hairs popping up in my field of vision. I thought it might be related to humidity or some other factor, but it's happened consistently now and I wonder if the oil somehow inspires my beard to take on a life of its own.

Take my comments with a grain of salt; I've got unruly curly hair (including a curly beard), and my sense of smell is perhaps more sensitive than others, or maybe you choose to wear a lot of fragrance that might mask or overpower the oil's scent. While it might work better for others, I'm on the fence about the pros and cons of this product.",1465257600,2016-06-07

I am not overly fond of most florals--I much prefer ""mens"" type fragrances like vetiver, leather, oak moss, spices (like cardamom and nutmeg) and sandalwood. This lands somewhere in between. It is definitely floral, and feminine, but not overpoweringly so. It doesn't scream ""old lady"" or ""teeny bopper"" either. It smells the most like the John Frieda Color Gloss, if this helps. The dry-down is meh. I love either a powdery iris dry-down or a sandalwood/musk/vanilla one, and this seems floral-ish to me.
It would be lovely to wear to a wedding, a tea, something like that, or maybe a date? Studies show men like the smell of desserts, so maybe better off choosing a vanilla scent?",1445299200,2015-10-20

The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20
4.0,"The color that comes out of this sunless tanner is incredible.  I am very familiar with sunless tanners and used St. Tropez tan foam with a mitt for the application.  On the first application, I only had time to put it on for an hour but had planned to have it on for three.  I felt really sticky with it on and wanted to rinse it off.  I was very impressed that the tanner left my skin darker than my ""dark tanner"" that I leave on all night frequently.  I am not a fan that it feels a little sticky and I cannot wear certain clothes because it has a bit of a residue.  However, it leaves a wonderful gleam on my skin that looks healthy and natural.  My skin looks healthy, hydrated, and cared for. Foams usually do not last as long as sprays and I prefer to have more on hand.  I also notice that its hard to tell when foams will run out so I am not sure I like that it is a form of application.  I will update with time but the color is beautiful, natural, and it actually lasts like a tan.
Pros-
1. very dark and natural tan achieved unbelievably fast
2. smells like perfume without as much of a sunless tanner smell
Cons-
1. quite sticky when on until rinse
2. If you miss a spot it is noticeable because of the drastic difference in tone. However, it is pretty easy to blend.
3.  watch out for your elbows, knees, and edges of wrists because it grabs color in those areas.
4. The fade is noticeable and blotchy",1526860800,2018-05-21

I did not like that it had a fragrance because I am extremely sensitive to scents but I did not have any reaction to the smell or to  the mask itself.  It was definitely gentle on my skin and my skin looked very nice after I used it.  It doesn't feel that strong.  I felt like I needed to leave it on there for more than 10 minutes and probably more than 15.  It was still very moist when I took it off but it felt like it needed to be more dry when I removed it in order to have the impurities attach to it.  That may not be the case but that was the sense I had about it.  Nevertheless, my face looked great when I was finished and that is what is most important.  I won't give it 5 stars because of the fragrance and because my face has been softer with other masks. but it is very easy and fast to take on and off and my face looked so smooth when completed.",1469836800,2016-07-30
5.0,"Another wonderful skin care product from Vichy.  Vichy is product line manufactured by Loreal.  They are well known for using thermal water form Vichy springs in their skin care line.  This product is intended for night time application on the skin and it is marketed as ""overnight mask"".  main ingredients of this product are: thermal water, squalane and citric acid.  For anyone not familiar with Squalane here is a brief description of the ingredient:

Squalane and Squalene are oily substances that are common components of other oils. Both Squalane and Squalene are natural components of human sebum, a mixture of lipids produced by glands in the skin. In cosmetics and personal care products, Squalane and Squalene are used in the formulation of a wide variety of products including bath oils, hair products, eye makeup, makeup foundations, lipstick, suntan and sunscreen products, body powders, nail products and in cleansing, moisturizing, and skin care products. Sqalane is sourced from shark liver; non-animal source also comes from olive oil. Another commercial non-animal source is phytosqualane, a compound derived from a farnesene in a sugar-cane sucrose fermentation over genetically modified Sacccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains. Farnesene is dimerised to isosqualane and then hydrogenated to squalane.

What is also important to mention is that this product has light blue color and it is incredibly easy to apply on the skin.  It is not greasy, it absorbs well and have sublime fragrance.  For anyone with sensitive skin, it may be important to mention that this product contains fragrance.  Size of the product is generous - 2.5 oz. and this big jar will last for up to 6 months if used up to 3 times a week as recommended by the product instructions on the back of the packaging.  Grocery stress and retailers like Walgreens carry this product in their aisles.  As far as price goes, it Is affordable skin care for anyone's budget.

I have received my product via Amazon, so I am not sure if it is the case with the packaging in the retail stores.  Cobalt blue packaging of this product had product descriptions that were in Cyrillic.  In their letters it says that this is new Innovative product , paraben free.  Just packaging itself, was like a piece of novelty that I found very amusing.",1453248000,2016-01-20

After using the Obliphica shampoo, I use this glaze once a week in place of the mask.  It brightens hair and highlights.  For me, it transforms dull darker blond hair to a good shade lighter or more reflective.

Oribe uses Watermelon, Lychee and Edelweiss Flower Extracts in this product as well as quinoa protein, passionflower, Cupuau and Brazil Nut Extract.  All of these items provide individual benefits to enhance shine and vitality of hair.

This product (when used infrequently as a conditioner replacement) doesn't make my hair feel weighted down or greasy.  It does offer some measure of control against flyaway and frizz too.

This is a luxury beauty product and I think the results it provides are worth the added expense. I would recommend it.",1491955200,2017-04-12

5.0,"THIS. This is my holy grail product. I'm a 26 year old woman who got through puberty just fine but lately have been experiencing some incredibly irritating breakouts. This has helped tremendously with lighting the post breakout marks and has completely turned my skin around. Before taking the plunge and shelling out for this serum I was bemoaning how my skin was looking dull and slightly textured. It wasn't breaking out all over but I was noticing some roughness and unevenness on my forehead in particular that exfoliating didn't seem to help. After one use I noticed my skin appeared a bit brighter. I've been using it semi-religiously for close to a year now and it has turned my skin around. I still get occasional breakouts that I'm trying to solve via dietary changes, spot treatments, new haircare products etc. but most of my skin is clear, bright and dewey. I've always had freckles that darken in the summer but this serum used in conjunction with an SPF gives extra protection and keeps the darker spots at bay. Also, I've just started using this on my neck and d&eacute;colletage area as well and am experiencing the same wonderful results I did on my face.

The serum has a nice, very mild citrus smell. It feels a bit oily at first (just use a few drops) but it absorbs very quickly into the skin (I have combo skin and this has in no way contributed or caused further breakouts) The dark bottle is a nice touch as it protects the serum from early oxidization though I do wish the dropper weren't an integrated part of the bottle. I feel like a different style dropper could even better protect the product from spoiling. I generally only use 5 drops a day for my face, 5-6 for my neck area so a bottle takes MONTHS to get through and I am always a bit worried that it will go bad before I can finish it... Overall though, do yourself a favor and give this amazing product a try.

NOTE: If you receive a serum that appears brown, it has oxidized making it ineffective and you should return or exchange it. This should be clear/golden/yellow in color and be sure to keep it in a cool, dark space.",1468454400,2016-07-14

I did have to get a piece of paper and fan my face to dry the product, but it didn't sting my eyes or burn my skin.

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

However, it does have a rather chemical smell to it, something that people with a sensitive sense of smell might find unpleasant. I haven't had any breakouts from using this serum, though I noticed that it takes a little longer to absorb than other serums I've tried, some higher end or vitamin E.

4.0,"I got the Little Teasers set and have now used three of the four colors that came in it. ""Rising Star"" is a thin-applying, coppery orange with glitter so small it appears as shine. The color, like most OPI, goes on easy, but I did decide to use three coats instead of two to get the desired intensity. It is not a pigment intense color. It is, however, quite striking and even though I got a lot of ""that's orange, Kat"" I also got a lot of ""it looks really good"" along with it, often from the same people. Men seem to like this color; women are also intrigued. Seeing as how it is autumn right now, this is a good color to wear. It is not too bright or shocking, so it is good to wear with any color; as your fingers turn the shine really kicks in.

I would recommend this for any time of year. I will probably not buy a regular-sized bottle of this, but I will definitely use up the tiny bottle that I have now and wear it with delight.

5.0,"Zwilling J.A. Henckels Ultra-Slim Nail Clipper do an excellent job. The construction and design of these clippers make it that they take up a  very minimal amount of space. Per following the illustrated instructions on the packaging my husband and I were able to figure out how to properly wield these for trimming finger and toenails. You simply slide the top part toward you to unlock it, then push that part all the way away from you, and then back toward you again to put the clippers into a cutting position. Closing the clippers is just as easy as opening them, once you get the hang of it.

The cuts are clean and never rip, tear, or leave one with the need to file ones nails after. The storage pouch is black leather and the clippers stay snugly inside once placed. Since these are so slender, I've swapped out another pair of clippers in my purse and these took their place. These do what advertised, take up very little storage space, and appear to be quite durable. I certainly recommend for all nail trimming needs.",1433894400,2015-06-10
5.0,"I wish I had the rest of the cosmetic line to test this product with, but I used my regular foundation, and it worked great.  The directions say to use a pearl sized amount of the product on your face, after cleansing and moisturizing, just before applying Vincent Longo foundation.

I found this product to be smooth, silky, and very comfortable on my skin. I do believe my face looked a little brighter and smoother when I wore this primer.  I am 50 years old and small lines are beginning to show, and I like to try different products.

A great moisturizer used on a regular basis (I like Kiehls products), along with daily exfoliating, makes all the difference for me. I will definitely enjoy using this primer while it lasts, but can't afford the expense to make it a permanent part of my daily regimen.",1391040000,2014-01-30
4.0,"This is pretty neat. It comes in two layers, the top piece for the upper part of your face and the lower for the bottom. The directions were not super clear. It said to leave the mask on for 10 minutes or more. This is where it got confusing for me. Does it dry like a Biore strip? Once it's dry do you pull it off? Or does it stay a little wet and you just pull it off after the 10 minutes? Some of the mask started to dry, so I waited about 5 minutes longer and a little more of it dried but I didn't want to stay in the bathroom all night so I ended up pulling it off.

At first while it was drying I thought my face stated to get warm. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be like that if I was having a reaction or if I should leave it. So, I braved it out. I tried not to think about how red my face would be the following day if it truly happened to be a bad reaction. Luckily, I think it was all in my head as there was nothing wrong.

Next mask I'll leave on longer to see if it's any different but my face was really soft after taking off this mask. It was a little tricky to apply and it didn't quite seem to fit around my eyes and was a little longer than my nose which got in the way of breathing. I had to push the excess up and off to the side. It didn't quite stick to the side of my nose either and there was a bit of a gap near my eyes and temples.

I like the idea of the volcanic ash. Everyone says how restorative it is. I'm so glad this doesn't smell like sulfur though.",1470009600,2016-08-01

5.0,I smelled this on someone who came in my store and really liked it.  I made a mental note that perhaps sometime Id get a bottle for my wife.  Serendipitously not long after this I was offered it as a product for review.  I still love it and more importantly my wife says she absolutely does too.  Its a kind of mature soft and warm very feminine scent with good lasting qualities.  It is easy to like Jimmy Choo because it just smells so good in a classic kind of way.,1517788800,2018-02-05
5.0,"Very nice and light shampoo, it doesn't leave a greasy feel in your hair like the shampoos on the market today. I have fine hair and was struggling to find something that wouldn't weigh it down, this is it, it rinses right out that my hair squeaks, back in the day my mom would always say, ""you rinse until your hair squeaks"" and this stuff does just that, nice body to my hair and I like the scent, I also grew up with egg shampoo, I was happy to see someone still sold egg shampoo, if you have fine lifeless hair then this is for you, try it",1462060800,2016-05-01

5.0,"Never heard of Japonesque, so the first thing I did was check into the history behind the name. Turns out Japonesque was inspired by the famous Kabuki theater in Japan. Japonesque makes quality professional make-up tools, and bright, bold, theatrical colorful makeup products.

I absolutely love this lip lacquer. Shade 04 is a bright pinkish/red creamy dream, that stays on like no other lipstick. I'm fair skinned with green eyes, and strawberry blond hair, and this shade brightens my face, without looking overdone. It goes on with precision due to the wonderful brush wand. During the day, I like to blot with a tissue after applying, at night it's full gorgeous color. Either way, this lipstick continues to be creamy, no stickiness at all, and it lasts through drinks, food, and loads of talking. To top it all off, it's nourishing, as my lips stay wonderfully hydrated with no drying affects at all.

Nice little flash of design/color on the top of the tube. Great lipstick!",1416096000,2014-11-16

4.0,"From the directions on the packaging this product is more of a bronzer, highlighter, blush sort of thing.

After you have your foundation on put a little bit over your cheek bones or any where you need to bring light to your face.

Powder and finish as usual.

The cream is like foundation consistency. It has a sparkle shimmer to it. After applied you can see the shimmer a little, but it is not as if you just rubbed glitter on your face.

It is subtle and very pretty. Wore it on a morning I was particularly tired and everyone thought I looked refreshed and awake...I know when I started the day I felt neither.",1414713600,2014-10-31
1.0,These razor blades are way overpriced. I have gotten a much better shave from blades that are much cheaper. The Astra or Derby Blades in particular give a better smoother shave and are much cheaper.,1383436800,2013-11-03
3.0,"I've been applying this cream twice a day for almost a month.  Once in the morning, and then again before bed.  It does not feel heavy at all and has a nice consistency.  I couldn't find any directions for this product on the package or on the jar which is unusual.  It has a description of the product on the package in every language going.  There are directions on the amazon page.  You dab some dots of the cream on your problem areas, spread the product upward and then massage it in.  I really haven't noticed any difference in my skin compared to all the other products that I have been using for wrinkles.  They all basically plump up your face so that wrinkles aren't as noticeable.  You can use many other products for a lot less money, more like in the low $20 range that will have the same effect, in my opinion.",1460332800,2016-04-11

2.0,"Don't know where my previous review went but let's start over. First, after many uses, the changes I noticed were great and so worth it! Maybe 70% of hair gone and what was left grew in really slow and I shaved way less often. Time passes. Lot's of time and today, the hair has filled back in. Granted, it still appears slightly more sparse and it grows slower still, but all bald spots that I thought were done for good have regressed. The hair isn't has thick and dark appearing as it used to be, so that's a plus, but not the permanent result that I wanted. Maybe I'll try for round 2 someday, but for now it's nice not spending the time on it.",1502236800,2017-08-09

5.0,This is one of the very few beauty products I'm completely sold on.  It REALLY does reduce the dark circles and baggy look under my eyes; with regular use.

5.0,"The jack black conditioner is wonderful. My hair is so dry that I after I shampoo and rinse, it feels like straw in my hands. The Jack black was working as I was running my fingers through my hair, I could feel my hair soften and the texture become smoother right in the shower.

 I like that this is also a scalp conditioner with the tea tree oil. A lot of conditioners tell you to only put it on the ends of your hair, because it will weigh down around the scalp. The Jack Black is light and rinses out easily. Afterwards my hair was shiny and smooth, even the ends which desperately need a trim.",1440201600,2015-08-22
5.0,I have used more products than most people... high end products and prescriptions. This retinol is very effective. My skin looked younger and had a beautiful flush to it in one week. It peeled but only mildly...nothing that would prevent one from going out in public. I used this cream in conjunction with a prescription bleach cream to remove discoloration I have and it WORKS!!! I highly recommend using this with a hydroquinone. Great also for acne scars. I haven't even finished the first bottle and already purchased a second. Great price for the product as well. Has a hydrating feel which is nice and does not have an odor. MUST wear sunblock whole using this at all times.,1458086400,2016-03-16
4.0,"Let's ignore the price for a moment: this is a very fine pillowcase. It's soft, it's attractive, it's comfortable. The color is neutral and perfect for my chocolate-cherry-hued bedroom.

Will the pillowcase rejuvenate you? Since this fabric is touted as ""patented,"" you might wonder about the science behind it. Though I searched a few different ways (Illuminage is a joint venture of cosmetic research company Syneron and Unilever Ventures; Cupron's patent pertains to its antibacterial/antimicrobial properties which is why you'll see the material used in socks) I could not find anything to substantiate the rejuvenation claim. A clinical study involving 57 participants suggested a statistically significant positive effect, but copper-infused fabric is not the same as copper peptides, which have been proven to affect the skin, and I personally was not convinced by the photos. Subtle differences only, could be lighting-related.

Too, unless you sleep with your face buried in the pillow, any rejuvenating effect will be uneven, limited to the side that touched the fabric. And if you sleep on your back, you're not going to see an impact on your face at all. My own experience is that the side of my face that comes in contact with the pillowcase looks a lot less smooshed than it would with a regular pillowcase when I first jump out of bed. A half hour later, both sides look the same.

I notice that Amazon sells a similar product at a much lower price, so if you're skeptical about the technology but still want to give it a try, there's this option:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/London-Luxury-34-Skin-Glow-34-Pillow-Cover-Cupron-Copper-Technology/dp/B006WC5TC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">London Luxury ""Skin Glow"" Pillow Cover Cupron Copper Technology</a>

I like this pillowcase, I really do. And compared to the price of a peel, laser treatment, fillers, or facelift, it's a bargain. But you're also not going to get the same results as you'd get with one of those treatments.",1471132800,2016-08-14

It includes some of the ingredients that scientists are touting for improving the appearance of skin.

4.0,"Like most Vichy products, it's expensive but this one was just so-so. It's meant to be used as a light moisturizer or primer, which you can wear under your makeup. It doesn't have any SPF and so I used this primarily at nighttime, just before bed. The box says it makes your skin feel hydrated, brighter and fresher, but other than giving me a strong dose of fragrance, I didn't see a vast improvement on my skin that justifies the higher cost.

Also, despite its high price tag, the box was shipped rather carelessly in a small padded envelope that didn't provide enough protection to keep the cap from being cracked and letting some of the lotion leak out. The box looked like it had been bounced about quite a bit. If you find it works for your skin, I would purchase it at a nearby drug store rather than have it shipped online.",1488153600,2017-02-27
3.0,"This Vichy Neovadiol Night cream is kind of a green/blue color and what I consider to be a medium consistency. It has an odd scent I find unappealing, though the scent does fade quickly upon application. This cream is paraben free. This cream sounded great to me- it's supposed to be formulated for post menopausal women, have an anti-warming effect, provide immediate hydration and make skin feel denser. The box also describes the cream as non-sticky, soothing and good for sensitive skin. This cream should have been perfect for me. I'm in the targeted age group, I use a cleanser by Vichy that's fantastic for my skin, and I have sensitive skin that gets dry. I also have a weak spot for high quality skin care products made in France like Vichy.:)

Unfortunately, on application, this cream isn't compatible with my skin. I've tried it a few times, but each time it makes my face feel prickly and itchy. It causes my skin to get small bumps within minutes (which is likely causing the prickly feeling). I don't feel an anti-warming or soothing effect, plus this cream feels tacky on my skin. I do have sensitive skin and occasionally have allergic reactions to products.  My skin is clearly sensitive to something in this product, so it's just not a cream I can use. I am giving it a neutral rating, however, because in my experience Vichy makes good products, and I have had negative reactions to products that others don't experience so I can't say it's a bad product. But I do know it's not good for my skin.",1458259200,2016-03-18
5.0,Most luxurious shave cream I have used.  Just a dime size dollup gave me a face full of very rich lather.  The smell was very masculine but not overpowering.

2.0,"Tried this after becoming very disappointed with the AOS (art of shaving) shaving cream line. This wasn't the solution. Ingredient list has all the right stuff, but I find the lather to be extremely weak. Very very small layer of protection even when I use a generous amount of cream. Can't even use my badger brush and a bowl to bring a healthy lather, just won't work. Experimented with proper amounts of water several times to see if I could find the right consistency, but could never find it. I would amount this to being the shaving cream. I will continue my search as this product just wasn't for me. The art of shaving provides a better leather, but is very drying.

Within moments of application, my skin absorbs the lotion, without leaving any greasy residue. I also love the lavender scent - which is very soothing, especially at night. One thing I don't like is how the container seems to dispense too much. I prefer that it dispense less but there appears to be a lot of air packaged in.

It is subtle and dissipates quickly leaving only the lightest fragrance lingering.",1509235200,2017-10-29

4.0,"This makeup brush is long, 6.5 inches, and just fits in my makeup kit. The bristles are soft, rounded and open, not dense. The brush picks up blush lightly for nuanced shading. I like the ergonomic handle. It's a wide grip made from silicon-like material that is ridged and comfortable in the hand. The only thing I would say is that you need to have powder in a good-sized compact, because the brush is wide, an inch across, and tapered, so that you'll only pick up powder at the tip if you have a small compact.",1458086400,2016-03-16

The toner is supposed to help refine and improve skin appearance due to aging. However, the jury is still out. I haven't seen any noticeable improvement yet. At any rate, I'll continue to use it since I like how refreshing it is. Other than the so-so scent, it's worth a try.",1474329600,2016-09-20

I wait for it to heal and just move onto the next in line.
This just feels like a light moisturizer. There is really no scent to this product. I don't notice it at all when it's on and absorbed. It's easy to pump just what you need and it absorbs quickly on your face.
I've been using  (see example in pictures) a pump dabbed around my eyes morning and night. I don't have bags but I do have fine lines. I don't know that I've noticed a lot of difference but my skin doesn't feel dry.

3.0,"I know Vichy from Europe when I grew up and it was consider a good stuff (maybe because it's from France and French ladies are known for their nice skin, myth or not). It was also rather expensive and sold only through pharmacies. In US it's available in most of the drug stores, but don't let that fool you. Although they are nor pricey and are not load with a lot of high end ingredients the Vichy products are very good.
This particular oil's first ingredient is mineral oil- sounds scary? Baby oil is pure mineral oil and it does good job in removing make up too. Than some dissolvents, emollients and finally Camellia seed oil and vitamin E.

Performance:
it does remove make up well, but not 100% from eyes. I still use eye make up remover on reusable cotton pads. It didn't dried my skin and makes pore look very small (most oils do;jojoba, castor, maracuja etc).

It lacks some luxurious and antiaging ingredients, it is basic cleanser, will not do any harm but if you are looking for cosmetics and skincare without mineral oil this is not for you, and if you need more antiaging products you need some good serum after this.",1445990400,2015-10-28

The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol.

It smells amazing and I don't have to use very much and every tangle falls out with very little effort. I don't know any other leave in conditioner that can do that and I have used a bunch of them. I actually don't use normal conditioner because I have such oily hair, and I mean to the point of I wash it in the morning and by the evening it looks as if I haven't washed it in weeks.

4.0,"Generally, I only sport a beard for a month or so each year when I withdraw from society and allow my laziness to reign supreme. The Vaughn Beard oil proved to be as effective in reduction of itchiness during the early growth period as a couple of other products I have tried and is rapidly absorbed without any significant oily residue. With the fast absorption and absence of residue, staining of shirt collars is not much of a concern. Not much of the product is required to achieve full coverage, especially with closer cropped cuts.

The concentrated solution  It is easier to apply than beard balms or salves I've used and seems equally as beneficial in softening gray hairs reducing the brillo pad effect and providing a light sheen as well.

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

4.0,"It's difficult to describe perfume without sounding extraordinarily pompous, but ""it smells nice"" doesn't seem sufficient for an amazon review. So here I go -- 'm not sure this scent ""captures the essence of femininity"" but it is a very feminine scent.  Seems more formal than playful to me, something I'd wear for an occasion rather than every day.

The box reads:
This scent captures the essence of femininity built around a core of woodsy notes that form the base. Layers of vanilla and almond continue the theme of warmth, while mandarin orange and cyclamen round out the top.
An elegant, sensual and classic scent to make you feel unforgettable like Rome.

This scent comes on strong right out of the bottle and it smells very formal and floral to me. Pretty overwhelming -- very ""perfumey"" and old-fashioned.  I want to say grandma-ish, but nearly all of my friends are grandmas . . . and they sure don't smell like this.  The initial pow dissipates quickly, and fades to a light, pleasant, powdery citrus scent.  I do not detect warmth, muskiness, almond or woodsy notes, nor do I detect the kind of fresh, green scents I usually go for.  I smell citrus and powder, with floral overtones. Pleasant and feminine.  Nothing earthy or exotic of woodsy, and no hint of vanilla.  Does it remind me of Rome?  Not exactly.  But it does smell nice.

The more I wear it, the more I like it.  It is very long-lasting!  Although it's an eau de toilette, it is longer lasting than most perfumes I have.",1423180800,2015-02-06
3.0,"Bit on the musky side for my liking.

Full disclosure: I have an unnatural love for Acqua di Gio. Its citrusy notes make me so happy. I love sandalwood, jasmine, and orange. A bit of spicy fragrance is cool too. It's why I've loved Gio for so long. When I saw that this fragrance is in the citrusy side, I was happy to give it a shot. Also, bear in mind that I don't wear fragrance every day, because I enjoy cooking, and you don't want anything to interfere with the smell of the food.

According to the marketing notes for L!ve, it's meant to hit you with lime at the forefront, and then bring out green notes of leaves in the background. That's fine by me. Guess what I didn't get? Lime. Leaves. What I did get is this overwhelming musky smell, which I dislike. Axe body spray grosses me out. I hate the stuff, and damn near every teenage boy I know bathes in the stuff.

L!ve has a strong musk to it. The musk overpowers the citrus, the leaves, and the liquorice that was promised. That said! It does have a sweetness to the edges of the scent which is rather nice. There's also a ground note of earthiness rather than freshness. Why is this good? It covers the smell of sweat rather handily. Other fragrances, that tend towards the lighter, more airy side tend to clash with the natural scent of the body, and will be jarring. If you're one of those types that sweats a lot, L!ve is your jam. It's got serious staying power. One spray (AND NO MORE) is enough to last throughout the work day, and leave a little bit of lingering fragrance at the end of the day. Don't do more than one spray, or you'll be consumed by the scent. It's better to have it be subtle than something that people can smell before you show up.

Bear in mind that this is eau de toilette, which means that it's not going to be as strong as an eau de parfum. Generally, it'd mean that you'd need to put more on to get the effect. Not the case here. The fragrance is strong, and has plenty of staying power.

Why did I not rate this lower? Because it does grow on you over time. Throughout the day, I noticed that it mellowed out from the harsh muskiness that I got when I first put it on. And, as a product goes, it's not a bad product. It just doesn't live up to the promises it makes.",1423094400,2015-02-05

I had a similar-looking expensive department store product as a concealer and wasn't at all happy with it, it  did not provide complete coverage. So either I had unluckily bought a particular tube that was a lemon, or the entire product line was faulty.  After that, it took me a while to get around to trying this, principally because I recently had some facial work done and  no concealer was going to hide that resulting swelling, discoloration. But the work is healing a bit now, looking better, and this concealer worked just fine on any remaining problems.  No irritation. One tip: use sparingly: a little goes a long way.

4.0,"In my cabinet, I have two types of sunblock or sunscreen: the heavy-duty type for swimming or for instances where I expect to sweat heavily, and the type that I use for everyday, brief sun exposures, when I walk to my office and back, and perhaps get some sun during my lunch hour.

Despite its luxurious look and name, this product belongs in the latter category. It's not made for the beach, despite its name and SPF. The lotion is light and absorbs easily, but it isn't water resistant, perhaps because its formulation allows you to get a nice tan while protecting you from the sun.

As someone who doesn't like to tan and would have been happy with more resistant sunblock, I found this a little annoying, as the item wasn't openly branded as such. The price is pretty high, so you're paying more for the cachet of using a brand that looks upscale and hence, popular among those who tan and see it as a status symbol.

3.0,"Years ago my cologne of choice was a Calvin Klein creation called CK One. That scent was light clean  and citrusy, the type that I still prefer though my current go to choices have been Issey Miyake L'eau D'issei and Fierce by Abercrombie and Fitch. (Mentioned to establish a baseline of personal preference.) Those both qualify for the suggested correct strength of a scent also, of being barely detectable until someone has leaned into your personal space. I was anxious to see what the people at Klein had released with this new Reveal. Love the container which has clean lines and suggests something simple but elegant inside. The first spray revealed a scent that had strong overtones, at least to my nose, of Vanilla beans and a hint of Almonds; both very pleasant. It takes a few minutes for any scent to mix with your individual body chemistry and skin oils and any initial alcohol to evaporate before it settles down to it's real character. Allowing that time left still very strong scent of vanilla and perhaps talcum powder, but very, very sweet. Almost overpoweringly so. In fact it caused me to react by repeated sneezing. Something I've never experienced with any product before. You want a scent to linger so it lasts throughout your day, but this scent was so strong I found myself with a headache and actually needed to wash it off!  Imagining, perhaps, something else in the environment had caused the reaction, I applied it again the next day, but the reaction was the same. The scent was so overpowering that I felt the need to apologize to anyone near me, and hoped I wasn't giving off the impression of those people we all know who seem to take a bath in their perfume or cologne. (My elderly third grade teacher comes to mind, though was forgiven after my parents explained that elderly folks sometimes have their sense of smell diminished so put on copious amounts of a scent until they can detect it!) To be clear, I like the scent and tones, but if the volume could be dialed back considerably. I even tried spraying it on my fingers to just then dab a bit on my neck, but it still has boom box volume. Sorry Calvin, you still have all my boxer and blue jean dollars, but until the scent is toned down in another incarnation, I can't use Reveal. I suggest, as with any scent, a person test it at your department store of choice or at a duty free shop between flights to see if the scent and powerful strength is to your liking. As with all things, scent and strength are relative to our individual taste and perception. But the screaming volume and cotton candy sweetness that lingers unfortunately make it unusable for me.",1444780800,2015-10-14

5.0,"I have this in ""Tropic Hues"" (I got it in a limited edition Birchbox).  I think the actual product has a bit more purple in it than is evident from the official product image here, but the color is quite pretty, and it's a lovely, rosy color on my cheeks (I'm the palest foundation shade and it's not too dark for me).

I am a fan of the baked blushes.  This is one of the first I used, but there is something about the baking that makes it not very powdery or crumbly, so there's not a lot of fallout and pretty much no wasted product.  So the package lasts a long time.  (Though I don't think I've ever finished a blush...)  I just take a little bit onto a brush and swipe it across each cheek, then blend with my fingers.  I have on primer, liquid foundation, concealer, and powder foundation under this, and it doesn't interfere with any of those, but rather blends pretty nicely.  It also looks good with some highlighter added on top of my cheekbones, when I am wearing this.

This lasts all day for me and does not irritate my skin, nor does it make me break out.  It is easy to get off with my standard facial cleanser.  It *is* possible to put too much on if you are pale, so be careful if that is the case.  But it is at least somewhat buildable if you have a darker skin tone, so it should work for people with a wide range of complexions.",1466035200,2016-06-16

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19
4.0,"I'm not sure why La Roche-Posay labeled this is a micellar water (I have a feeling that they did so just to tap into the micellar trend) since micellar waters don't need to be rinsed, and this one certainly does.  Despite the name, it's a nice cleanser that does a really nice job of removing makeup.

The texture is a bit strange and sticky/spongy, and is unlike any other cleanser I've used before.  Once I got used to the texture, though, I found that I do really like this, but it's probably better for summer; while, it removes my makeup really well, it leaves my oily yet sensitive skin feeling a bit stripped.  I'm actually surprised that this is labeled as being for sensitive skin because of that.",1482451200,2016-12-23
5.0,"This is a beautiful citrus-y, summery scent; very light and youthful. I really love this. It goes on light and bright, and has good staying power. I think as the afternoon wore on it mellowed into a slightly more mature scent, but nothing heavy or overly sexy. It reminds me of the Colors by Benneton scent, but a little brighter.  The bottle is classy and stable, and my one caveat was that it arrived to me from Amazon with a dented box. It was obviously just tossed in a cardboard box where it had room to slide around and get dented. Since perfume is often given as a gift, I thought I would bring that up, since it doesn't look as great for gift-giving as it would if you bought it from a brick-and-mortar store where it would presumably be more carefully handled. Still, a lovely scent and great product. I would wear this and give it as a gift.",1445472000,2015-10-22

3.0,"My normal facial skincare routine is currently owned and operated by Boscia. I use their toner, gel peel, and sake balm moisturizer. This Thermal Spring Water seemed to be a semi-moisturizer, semi-toner sort of product, so I tried it on both a washed face and then during the day as a ""pick me up.""  Honestly, I could see no results from either method. It was no more soothing than just misting some distilled water on my face, maybe slightly more moisturizing. I will say that it is easy to apply - just spritz and go, and it didn't muss up my make up where heavier moisturizers may.",1447286400,2015-11-12

As to what the brush is made of, I have no idea.  There is no indication on the box.  It just says that it's natural fibers.  I'm going to guess it is animal fur.  I described rabbit previously.  Another way to describe the feeling is, it is very much like pressing your face into your cats fur.

2.0,"My heritage is Irish, English, and Austrian. My skin isn't just fair ... it's crazy fair. As a teen, I had a great deal of trouble finding a foundation and concealer that didn't translate as vampiric or traffic-cone orange. Back-in-the-day, Macy's steered me toward Channel foundation and Sephora showed me the wonders of Bare Minerals. Both are perfection (one a dewy finish, the other matte). To this very day, I alternate them depending on mood or moisture needs. Now, I have tried a few new products (especially since I am trying to go a little more natural and that means eliminating the Channel). I recently bought Ole Henriksen Perfect Truth(tm) CC Crme Broad Spectrum SPF 30 (becuase I LOVE that entire line and it is completely natural). Well, it made me look insane. When I say ""orange,"" I mean ""ORANGE!"" This new ""em"" product pretty much had the same results. Moreover, it was so oily, that I worried it may not be compatible with contact lens (I feared it may migrate and sully the lens).

For now, it seems that I will be sticking with Channel (and Bare Minerals). Both lines cater to fair-skinned women and both lines are ""tried and true."" As it stands, this concealer may need to be ""revamped."" I look forward to trying this product again once it has been reformulated.",1409529600,2014-09-01

I love the smell, and I love being able to run my hands through my hair and have my aging, color-treated, daily blow-dried hair feel SOFT. Even the next morning, before I wash my hair again, I can still feel the softness, it's long lasting.

My only quibble is with the packaging. This particular pump is short to the base, and does not dispense much product. And I found I needed a lot of product to get full coverage.  I found myself having to get 4-5 pumps to cover my shoulder length hair.  A pump that dispenses more would have been more useful. And the pump being so close to the base also seems to make it a little stiffer, it's not as easy to pump as other products I have.

But other than the pump, this is a nice conditioner. Recommended.",1491609600,2017-04-08

5.0,"I have been using the Stila Convertible for a couple years now. I started with Poppy, moved to Rose, then added others: Petunia, Fuchsia, Gladiola.

Peony is one of the last ones I ventured on, because I didn't think it would suit my NC42 (warm medium-dark) coloring. I thought it would just be too light and a bit too muddy.

WRONG. Wonderful cheek color on me. Very good discreet color that enlivens cheeks subtly for daytime. I love how it matches delightfully with one of my fave lipstick combos: Dolce Vita by Nars, the pencil, lipstick and gloss. This cheek color is perfect for that popular lip color.

As I said, I'm on the darker side of medium, olive-toned. I can wear some of the Stila Convertibles on my lips, the richer colors--Poppy and Rose. Others are just too light. But for fairer ladies, I think lots of these colors would work wonderfully.

I will add that having a quality brush makes application a dream. I don't use fingers to apply on cheeks. I find my MAC skunk brush (and the mini skunk brush) both apply beautifully, especially POPPY which can be garish if the application is not skillful.

It's best to apply lightly and build up on the cheeks. It's best to use a lip brush to apply on the lips.

I love this product so much, I went to eBay to buy ""Orchid"", a discontinued color. It's the darkest/deepest of the colors, deep berry. It's one of my faves, so a pity they don't make fresh ones.

On a note for Asian-toned/Golden-skinned/Warmer skinned ladies: The gladiola is amazing. I thought that color would be gross, but it totally adds light and glow to the skin (as does Petunia, but that one is more like warm pink/coral). Gladiola has orange tones, but it's not clownish. If there is warm/gold in your natural skin tone, this will just LIGHT you up. I love it for warm/sunny days/summer.

Petunia goes beautifully with MAC Cyndi (discontined) I love that combo.

Lillium was one I tried that was a total fail on my coloring. It's definitely for fairer ladies.

Anyway, I highly recommend this,e specially for aging/dry skin. I'm 52, and used to always use powder blush. But post-menopause, my skin got crazy dry. I can use foundation, the Stila blush, and no powder, and I look fine.

My favorite eyeshadows are from Urban Decay, Lorac, Tarte, Bare Minerals Ready, Smashbox (Photo Op only), Too Faced, etc.  Sorry to say, but this palette was a miss for me - especially considering the price of $34.  This is Elf quality makeup.  If you are used to high quality, easy to blend, creamy eyeshadows you WILL not like this.  At $34, I couldn't help but remember that my beloved Too Faced Natural Eyes palette was $36 - $2 more for 9 shadows (as opposed to 4) and all are far superior in quality.

On the positive side, the packaging is beautiful and sturdy with a nice mirror.  The size is great for travel and the colors look very nice.  I love warm neutrals.  Unfortunately, however, the quality of these shadows is sub-par.  The two top shadows have virtually no pigment and leave a virtually undetectable wash of shimmer on the eye.

Both Retinol and Reinoids are made from Vitamin A and it's the best thing available to reduce wrinkles and age spots.  Retinoids are the stronger variety that requires a prescription (Retin-A, Tazorac, etc.)  Retinol is the light duty variety that is good for daily use if you don't want to bother with a prescription.  Since Retinol promotes the growth of healthy new cells, your skin can get sensitive with these baby cells exposed on the surface, so it is important to stay out of the sun or wear sunscreen when using this product.  It is also good to use a moisturizer.

Keep in mind that alcohol is necessary in products with salicylic acid as it dissolves only in alcohol, not water or oil. Also you have to keep using salicylic acid for clogged pores to keep them clean, or they will come back to original size/state.",1455926400,2016-02-20

5.0,"This is a cheery red nail polish that is a terrific all season choice.(Disregard the murky brown shade depicted in the product description.) It is creamy and applies smoothly. It was free of the clumps found so often in cheaper brands. And speaking of free it is formulated without  formaldehyde,  dibutyl phthalate,  toluene,  formaldehyde resin and  camphor, making it a safer choice for those sensitive to chemicals. Additionally it is not tested on animals, a definite plus in my book. I was impressed with the end result. My nails looked glazed, smooth and shiny.  Drying time was average and the polish seems to hold up well.

Naming polishes after different international airports is a clever idea. This one is named after the Kings Canyon Airport in Australia's Northwest Territory, a bit over 800 miles from Darwin and about 200 miles away from Alice Springs. It is home to a national park known for its sandstone domes. I am not sure what correlation this color has to that location, but it is pretty. If you like polishes that are vibrantly pigmented with a glossy finish, this is definitely one to take on board.",1433289600,2015-06-03

This is one thing I'd actually buy again. The smell is really mild and not overwhelming, and it's the perfect weight for my hair (right in the middle of fine and thick, but a lot of it). I have long hair (past my shoulder blades) and was a little worried this wouldn't last very long, but it took me about two months to get through it, which I think is reasonable for the price (I was using it once or twice a week as a masque and every other day or so in the shower as general conditioner).

4.0,"This product has many of the ""in"" ingredients for the skin - and at least some are not just ""in"", but also proven effective.

It was kind of a surprise when I took the top off to find out that it is a pump container. Liked this over the usual jar.

When I got some of the product out, I noticed it smelled a little like grapes juice maybe - it does have some grape derived ingredient I think. In any case, it was a refreshing kind of scent. A bit heavier than what I'd prefer, but not over the top.

It went on an into my skin easily and made it look and feel a lot smoother than it had been. Stayed that way a while.

The current amazon price is $65 for 1.7 oz. That is a lot of money, but if the product works very well, it may be worth it. Will have to try this out longer term and report back. I'll give it four stars for now - subject to upgrade later.",1414886400,2014-11-02

I could look past that fact if this actually smelled good. It really does not.

I don't know what the whole ""sparkling"" thing in the description is supposed to mean. This is not a shimmering lotion. The price on this should really be $4.50 instead of $45.00.

PROS
1) Dermablend Quick Fix Body cover stick is small enough to slip in your wallet or take on the go.
2) Does not require a spatula to apply.  It rolls smoothly over whatever you want to hide.
3) Provides the same full-coverage that Dermablend Professional Cover Creme does.
4) Doesn't need to be applied in conjunction with a base or powder.
5) I used Quick Fix Body to hide a keloid scar on my thigh - and it stayed covered until I washed off the make-up with soap and water!
6) Is lightweight and doesn't rub off easily.  Yay!

CON
1) Dermablend is expensive.

I like this cover stick. A lot.  It's discrete - and it does what it's made to do. It covers imperfections so well that I don't have to think about them - until I do.  Grin.",1499040000,2017-07-03

4.0,"I am always looking for an effective sunscreen that does double duty as a blemish cover-up.  Im impressed with the effectiveness of this Dermablend Blurring Mousse.  Its not too thick or clumpy and in my case does an excellent job of covering the age spots that have popped up without permission just under my hairline.

I like that there are shades that you can choose and its not a one-size-fits-all like so many other sunscreen products.  You can choose a tone that is suitable for both daytime and nighttime wear.  The price point is a little higher than I usually choose but Ive found a little goes a long way  you certainly don't slather it on.  In fact its basically a high end make up item.  Its very natural looking; not cackey or maskey.",1498003200,2017-06-21
5.0,"As usual when I read reviews about products I see the helpful reviews and those that are written by unrealistic people. This lipstick is no exception in that reviews are varied. I guess I think it's common sense that a lipstick boasting to last 6 hours is going to stay on pretty well and not be full of moisture or that one needs to be somewhat precise when putting this on, but that's just me I guess. To address some of the concerns from other reviews, yes it does stay on, but it is easily removed with putting a balm on your lips so it's not like you are stuck with it. As far as messy goes, I don't see how it is messy, but hey, I guess someone did. What I do know is this is the best lipstick I have ever purchased. I don't wear makeup at all except of lipstick and mascara and I am cheap and not one bit into brand names, but this lipstick delivers. My lips actually look fuller wearing this and I love how the color stays. Yes, it is not a moisturizing lipstick but I would not call it drying. I do however dab a tiny bit of Aquaphor over it if my lips feel dry (not to much though or the color will come off). I am brunette with a medium skin tone that likes a more natural look and at first I ordered the color ""Aria"" (which I like), but it is to bold for my practical everyday look. The second color I ordered was ""patina"" which is my all time new favorite color. It is a stunning, natural looking mauve like rose shade that looks stunning on dark haired people. Again, this is the best makeup product that I have ever purchased and I would suggest giving it a try if you are a reasonable person and don't expect perfection out of a product.",1371772800,2013-06-21

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29
5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

It is not the strongest moisturizer. While the texture of this is like that of an oil, it does contain soap ingredients too, so it thoroughly lathers most of the moisture away, leaving you not at all greasy and only lightly moisturized. I still use lotion after, and I like the almond line lotion to harmonize with the scent of this.

5.0,"I wish I could give four and a half stars here - not because the product is lacking, but because of the price. I understand you can purchase any object at any price point and there are times when you want to get a nice gift for someone, but the price is a bit steep here.

That being said, this is a high quality gift set that anyone would enjoy receiving. The leather case is thick, designed to keep your tools secure, flat, and scratch free, and comes with a snap closure to keep everything securely in one place. The tools have a brushed finish, which is preferable for grooming sets so they don't show smudges or prints from normal use. The scissors have a rounded edge, designed for grooming nose and ear locations, but some might prefer a more specialized clipper tool for that job. Blindly going at your ear or nose might be a little unsettling for some. The nail file is a traditional metal nail file with a fine and rough side as well as a pointed tip.

The nail clippers are seriously sharp! They have a nice curve to them; not too curved, as I find most nail clippers that makes it difficult to get a good shape on nails. They also don't make your clippings go flying by some miracle of physics. This is probably the best thing about the kit. No one likes finding them in random spots in the bedroom or bathroom. They are also completely flat when they're being stored. This makes them perfect to slip into a travel bag if you want to leave the scissors behind and take these along for the trip without taking up any room at all.",1451952000,2016-01-05

I regularly use an exfoliating product and I like to switch them up since using the same thing every day tends to make the products not have as strong as an effect.  This is definitely going into my rotation of Hempz, Bath and Body Works sugar scrub and a scrub made by my esthetician.  I use the scrubs every other day since I have sensitive skin and the use of scrubs really helps to get rid of the dry dead skin and allow the moisturizer I use to really soak in.  The sugar crystals used in this scrub last long enough to do the job, then just disintegrate.

I have extremely sensitive skin and I have a had time finding skin products that I can use due to them making my skin break out in either a rash or  acne. I'm 52-years-old. I shouldn't have acne. So, I'm always up for trying new things in hopes that I find something that works well without causing irritation to my skin. While writing this review, I discovered that they have some that is SPF 60 dry finish as well. I think next I will try that one. So far this doesn't irritate my skin at all.

4.0,"This tinted lip enhancer is an oasis for dry lips. Thicker than a lip gloss it has a light, sheer peach tint. Among the ingredients are beeswax, jojoba oil, shea butter, castor seed oil and vitamin E. The website recommends applying three times a day for twenty-nine days for best results. It is supposed to ""naturally increase the fullness"" of lips while decreasing fine lines.

I like this product. It feels nice on  and does seem to moisturize and condition. I have been using it as directed with the last application at night before I go to bed. I must say my lips do feel better but I can't say I have observed any increase in fullness. The color is subtle and leaves lip looking fresh with a nice sheen. It does last but feels a little sticky as time passes. It also transfers to glass ware and utensils, leaving a greasy imprint.

Somewhere between a gloss and a balm, this product provides a little color and much moisture. It comes in seven colors, including clear,  shimmering peach, shimmering nude, shimmering rose petal, as well as ""Shiraz"", a sheer berry; ""Cosmo"", a sheer poppy pink as well as this product, the peach  ""Bellini"".

4.0,"I'm not above being vain and admitting that age isn't being kind to my face, so I've been looking at options other than botox and fillers in order to stave off the inevitable So the NuFACE Trinity sounds like a decent idea in theory. In order to get any real benefits, you're going to have to use this 3-4x a week for upwards of 8 weeks. I gave it a daily use for 3 weeks in order to get a review in, and I didn't notice anything in my face (nor did my wife, for what it's worth.) I even took photos of my face before I got started to see if it there was anything noticeable and didn't see anything. It's not to say that if I kept going for another 2 months that I might notice something - but I'm impatient. This item is definitely not for the impatient. A few of the youtube reviews along with the Amazon reviews I've watched seems that 8+ weeks is the consensus on seeing visible results. I'll reevaluate at 8 weeks to see if it's worth sticking with.

A few things: The unit itself feels pretty flimsy, and I was worried that with an accidental drop, it would shatter. Granted, I'm not going to drop it to test it out, but for a device that's upwards of $300, it doesn't feel like there's that quality associated with it. Also, the gel primer went fairly quickly it seems, and that adds to the cost of the overall kit - I'll probably need to buy a few more over the next two months. Additional attachments also run $150 or so, so this is clearly a system that would require a sizable financial commitment (along with the heaps of time!)

Overall I'm conflicted - the tons of positive reviews give me hope that this will eventually help out problem spots, but the time and financial commitment might make me consider the path of least resistance: a cosmetic dermatologist (or at least, a dermatology residency clinic.) But NuFace does give a 60 day money back guarantee, which I would expect (but only from NuFace's site it seems and at the time of writing this review, it's nearly $50 cheaper than Amazon!) But if you've decided to invest in the NuFace Trinity, you'll probably be investing an hour a week in using this on your face in addition to gel primer regularly.

I'm pleased that it comes in a tube, because it keeps contaminants to an absolute minimum -- a great feature for a product that will be worn next to your eyes. I received  this concealer through the Vine program. Although I was supposed to be sent color ""Fair Neutral/Cool"", I received ""the neutralizer"" instead.  I'm pale, and I typically wear the second lightest color sold in any makeup line, so ""the neutralizer"" was a bit dark for my skin tone. Even so,it worked better than I thought it would when I saw the color in the tube. I attribute this to how well it blends.

I was afraid it would be too iridescent and leave the eye area too shiny, but that did not happen. It makes skin tone and dark circles look more even toned and helps to hide these imperfections. The skin looks tighter and smooth. I actually apply it even a little lower than the eye area and a little more out towards the side side of my face because I have hyperpigmentation from sun exposure. This really helps to hide it and it doesn't look like you have any makeup or anything on your skin. Your skin just looks better. So smooth and more perfected. I really like this one. Similar products that I have tried were too shiny/iridescent but this one is perfect. It really makes it look like you did contouring and used cosmetics to change the look of your skin, but it doesn't actually deposit any color on your skin, so it doesn't look like make up is on you at all.",1448150400,2015-11-22

3.0,"This serum is less thick and has a more watery consistency than other beauty serums that I've used in the past.  It has a tendency to want to run between my fingers; which I don't like as it's rather expensive.  My biggest grip about this product is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to use it conservatively.  The pump only dispenses the product in full measures, you cannot gently press the pump to only emit 1/2 of the product.  I routinely need about 1 1/2 pumps to fully cover my face and neck however I get enough product by depressing the pump twice that invariably I am rubbing it into my hands and  shoulders in an effort to not completely waste it by wiping it off with a hand towel.  Considering that this product is priced around $50 an ounce (not hugely expensive but certainly not priced to be a hand cream), I would much rather have a better pump dispenser to ensure that I am not pumping out more than what I really need to use.

There is a very slight scent of apple from the product.  Due to the watery consistency, it takes longer is absorb into my skin than other ""age defying"" products.  You'll need to wait several minutes before applying your moisturizer over top of this product.  This product is designed to be applied after cleansing the face (morning and night) and after the serum is applied, apply your typical moisturizer.  This is NOT a stand alone moisturizer.

On a plus side - it's not sticky nor does it interfere with the application of foundation or powder.  My skin has not experienced any redness or breakouts with this product and it does not produce oiliness.  I should note that I have ""normal"" skin (not sensitive) and I typically have problems with oil on the sides of my nose - this product does NOT accentuated this problem (I've used many that have).

The list of  ingredients are the typical ""age defying"" ingredients that you'll find in most over-the-counter products.  I don't expect a miracle product with any over-the-counter beauty product.  Right now, this product is not accentuating my fine lines, it doesn't compete with my cosmetics (meaning that it doesn't make my foundation heavy), and my face feels smooth after using it - For me and my 40 plus skin, that is enough.  The only product that I've ever found to lighten my dark spots (due to too much sun expose as a teenage - sigh....., if I could only turn back the hands of time) is a light application of good old fashion concealer.

All in all, this isn't my favorite product (I still prefer the Olay age defying line).",1415404800,2014-11-08

I usually use a concealer in a light shade. I had the medium and found it to be on the lighter side but it worked well for my skin tone.

I don't have a lot of wrinkles around my eyes but tend to have dark circles. I found that overall, it worked well. It has a silky feel that I liked, it's easy to apply, and looks good. However at $28 it seems quite expensive - I don't like to spend that much on makeup.",1392249600,2014-02-13

5.0,"My hair dresser told me about Toppik's Hair Building Fibers because one of her clients has had success using it.  Toppik is intended to make your scalp appear as if it has hair in the right places.  This illusion is created by the tiny keratin particles bonding to your own hair.  If your scalp is actually bald and there is no hair that is combed over it, this product isn't going to work for you.  That said, it does wonders for those of us with thinning hair.  Just be sure to get the correct color that matches your own.  For example, the light blonde is strictly for those with very light, platinum blonde hair.  If your hair has the least bit of ash or red tone in it, opt for the medium blonde Toppik.

After you have dried your hair (using all of the products you normally apply), sprinkle the Toppik onto the areas that need to look fuller.  Lightly tap the area to help the keratin particles `grasp' the hair.  Once you have filled in these spaces, you may lightly style your hair.  Vigorous brushing will remove Toppik so, don't do it.  Toppik should remain in place until you brush or shampoo.
Applying Toppik is fairly simple.  Begin by sprinkling it a little at a time until you see the desired effect.  If you are placing it near your hairline, Toppik offers a tool for putting it in a small, defined area.  (I just hold a tissue on my face to avoid having it settle on my skin.)  The top of the jar is wide so, if you want to cover a very small area, the tool could be quite handy.

For even greater results, I recommend Toppik's Hair Fattener.  This is a leave-in treatment.  The results I have with it are impressive.  It works by making the hair appear a little thicker.  I have been using it for about six weeks and even my husband can see a small difference in the thickness of my hair.  (Toppik's claim is that continued use will make a permanent change in the thickness of the hair.) Using both products together will really help you look like you have no gaps of hair.

I still use another product (a colored powder) that I brush onto my scalp to help cover the sparser areas in front.  But, I use far less of it with Toppik's products.

5.0,"On my facial skin, and also on my wife's facial skin - immediate soak in and tight-smooth feeling. A little doesn't go far so one has to use it up faster than I anticipated. The skin absorbs it real fast; you have to anticipate using it at a faster than normal rate for a facial cream. I've purchased many facial creams on Amazon and reviewed most of them. So I have a sense of absorption rates and this is the highest rate I've ever come across.

After using it, one feels their skin being smooth, almost scary smooth. And it makes the skin feel tight while being moisturized at the same time. That's an unusual effect.

While I'm saying this is remarkable, the included parabens are worrying. The FDA is still studying the effects of parabens in cosmetics.

And yet it seems potentially too good to be true; it is remarkable and I wish everybody could test it out on their skin just to experience it's immediate effects.",1525392000,2018-05-04

More work than I care to manage first thing in the morning, plus the added recommended application of powder.

Note, this color was a bit too dark for me, and also too much red (or whatever color was there) and instead of covering some redness I have, it brought it out in all its 'glory'.",1498953600,2017-07-02
4.0,"My daughter and I *love* this finish cream. She has super-curly, thick, dry hair, so during school days she tames it by putting it in braids. However, the ends frizz up like crazy. As an experiment, we worked this into the ends. It did not look greasy, and it tamed them into one cute curl, which lasted all day. I also use it to tame the frizzies that pop up around my scalp. It's fine to use it on dry (as in, unwashed) hair.

Some of the other reviewers compared this to cold cream, so I was expecting more of a mayonnaise consistency. However, it's more like a wax, and it did take some effort to work it in. The fragrance is lovely, too. I'm taking a star off for the crazy price. However, a little goes a long way, so I'm hoping that that this jar will last us through the summer.

5.0,"I have used a few Juice Beauty products, but this is my first time using a whole system of products that are designed to work together. Even though I have been using Retin-A, this kit works well with my skin and I haven't experienced any irritation, not even with the peel. In fact, the peel cleared up some dry patches caused by the retinoid (and the dry Fall weather) it gave my skin a soft and glowing even tone. Wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable and I'm sure they will improve more as time goes on...with using the products regularly. My favorites in this kit are the peel, the serum, and the ""age defy"" moisturizer. My skin drank up the moisturizer even though it felt a bit heavier than the day cream (with spf). The day cream does have a slight ""whitening"" effect (due to titanium dioxide) and may be visible on darker complexions, especially if not worn under makeup. Using less, allowing it to ""soak in a bit"" or rubbing into the skin a bit more may help correct this. I mixed some of the age defy moisturizer to diffuse it, I most likely lost some SPF by doing this but it looked better on my skin. The serum is awesome, particularly around the eyes. The goal of this kit is to help the cells turn over and reveal softer and more even toned complexion. It works perfectly in this regard as a low level AHA & BHA peel (with supporting products) that can be used by all skin types, except, perhaps...more sensitive skin. I'm very pleased with the results, and intend to at least continue using the peel and the moisturizer when this kit is finished.

The leather itself is quite thin, which makes it very flexible and lovely, but also not exactly something I'd want to toss into a gym bag.

It doesn't really strike me as something that was designed with the idea that it would be going through anything that called for a particularly rugged bag.

It is large enough and pretty enough that I could see it serving as a handbag in a pinch, but that's not something I'd buy it for as a primary use.

Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

I've been using it only on my eyes, as I'm acne-prone and have a whole other routine for keeping it at bay. It feels and looks like water, with a very mild scent.

5.0,I would be super pissed if I bought this based off of the online portrayals of the color.  This is not a subtle pink.  This is neon pink and I jut happen to love it to death!  This is genuinely my go to lipstick.  I like the color and I love the formula.  It can dry kind of fast so you need to work quickly.  It dries fast and stays put.  It doesn't dry my lips out but it does transfer when eating/drinking.  It doesn't move around only lips though and the color stays very vibrant for hours.  I have tried a lot of liquid lipsticks and this is my favorite formula.,1462147200,2016-05-02

The painted plastic decoration arrived cracked and with very rough edges. It does not look nice in person, more of a child's fake perfume bottle for dress up. The bottle itself is glass and heavy, they should have just gone with an elaborate top and left the rest plain. The perfume is worth it, the bottle ruins it.

It's attractively made and works well, so how much more could I want? Just section off your hair with the clips and create the style you want.

5.0,"The Moroccan oil Weightless Mask was a product recommended to me by my hairdresser -  I am an avid swimmer who cannot stand the feel of a swim cap, I color my hair and own a plethora of hot hair tools, so suffice to say sometimes my hair needs a little TLC and after she used this on me at my last hair appointment I was hooked.

Now this travel size is a great chance to try the product before committing to the full size and even then note that it is  slightly pricey for the amount you get...but for me the results  are worth it so you be the judge.

To help you - I used this 2.53 oz size (and note I received a small tube not the tub as shown in the picture which is usually the full sized product) and got about 4  or 5 uses out of it. I tend to use a lot in one go and my hair is long, so you can probably be a bit more sparing and get a little more - but not much more -  use out of it! But ultimately this size would be great just to take on a trip or to see if this product is right for you, before spending upwards of $40. I also really liked the fact that you are able to get every last drop of the product out of the tube as nothing is more frustrating than spending money on a product then having residual amounts left behind due to poor packaging!

I use this about  once a week usually post swim and leave on for about 5 minutes. The smell is great and this scent lasts even when the mask has been washed out. It is very conditioning and I am  easily able to pull a comb right through after use. My hair is very soft without being weighed down  and does not have any feeling of residual product being left in which can often happen with hair masks or deep conditioners! It really has made a difference to my hair.

This was enough to convince me to purchase the full size product - it works,  smells amazing and really conditions my hair!  Great product!",1435536000,2015-06-29

3.0,"I love the way this sunscreen feels on my skin - soft and silky and not at all greasy or oily.  It seems to work as a sunscreen even though it is only 30 SPF.  It is a broad spectrum lotion, and has extra ingredients that are supposed to help prevent skin aging.

However, for me, this is just not a practical product,.  A general rule of thumb is to use a shot glass amount of sunscreen.  I think this whole container holds about a shot glass worth of product, 1.7 ounces.  It is supposed to be reapplied at least every two hours, and if you sweat or swim, you are supposed to use a different water resistant sunscreen.  It does pump out in a small stream, so you don't end up pumping more into your hand than you need.

While this is a high-quality product, I think it depends on its good brand name to justify such a high price.  The ingredients, no matter how good they feel on my skin, don't justify the price.  Or the need for frequent replacement because this stuff just doesn't go all that far.

Even though I like using this, it is not going to be part of my skin protection arsenal.  I'm going back to the more common drugstore stuff, and splurging on something else.",1486598400,2017-02-09

I have tried the pinks( light and dark ones) and the reds( which are currently my faves!) and this is a tried and true ""when in doubt color"" for sure. it is most appropriate for those who need subtle color on their nails for work or simply prefer a neutral shade.

5.0,"I have used Calvin Klein Eternity for some years. I have found the scent to be compelling, with a very fresh, clean aspect.

Eternity Now for Men is an update, refreshing the product line, initially introduced in 1989. Calvin Klein notes that Eternity Now is ""an oriental fougre with ginger, coconut water, star anise, starfruit, cedar, patchouli, tonka bean and vanilla.""

The result is excellent. It has an even fresher, cleaner aspect than before. I see that some Amazon reviewers are not happy with the update. So there may be some disagreement among those of us who've long liked the Eternity line.

Will you like it? Fragrances are a very personal thing. Eternity Now is high-quality and priced accordingly. I would suggest trying it at a department store and seeing for yourself.",1449705600,2015-12-10

I always test products on my hands first, never knowing how my face will react.  My hands have been in and out of water all day yet still feel soft. I don't feel the need to reapply.

It is vanilla (& a heavy dose of Styrax Benzoin, I think) with slightly bitter wood undertones and just a hint of spice; maybe cinnamon, nutmeg & cloves.  It's not really sweet but has a candle wax note that is a bit off-putting to my nose.  It just doesn't smell as deep and rich as most Montale parfum.  Perhaps too much styrax benzoin which often smells cheap to my nose.

4.0,"Had never heard of Japonesque, which seems like a strange moniker for a product made in Italy and distributed through London and California.  The packaging is a glass bottle (not plastic) with a pump that lets you dispense just a tiny amount, which is very nice.  However the clear plastic top that sits over the dispenser was not on tight and some product had leaked out on to the bottle and inside the cardboard box.  Not a lot, but enough to warn against packing this in a travel bag or makeup bag.

The web site does not provide any information about ingredients.  This does not contain any sunscreen, so will be relegated primarily to night time use.  The list of ingredients is printed on the box, and this contains the usual things -- for example dimethicone, glycerin, talc, mica, PEG 10-15 cross polymer, butylene glycol, silica, fragrance, among others.  It does not state whether it is paraben free, which suggests it is not.

The color I received, No 4, is a light-medium shade that is on the cool side, without any yellow or pink undertones.  The fragrance is negligible.

On the skin this feels like it is at least partly silicone based, rather than  cream based.  It has very good slip but still covers quite well, without feeling at all heavy or oily.  I usually use tinted moisturizer with SPF during the day -- and sometimes I further mix that with regular facial moisturizer when I apply.  Not generally a fan of ""coverage,"" so was pleasantly surprised to see that you can control this and attain a very natural finish.  Does an especially nice job in the slightly darker areas under the eyes so I may even use this as a concealer primer in those areas even when I am using only tinted moisturizer on the rest of my face.

This is a lovely product.  As I do not generally use a true foundation  I have little basis for comparison.  I would definitely reconsider repurchasing this, but would be even more inclined to do so if it had some sun protection, preferably physical rather than chemical.",1414800000,2014-11-01

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

3.0,"After trying a Vichy shaving foam that I really liked I ordered this Vichy Idealia Glow Essentials gift set for my wife to try.  She is always looking for facial products to make her feel more youthful, so she was very excited to give this set a try.  The gift set arrives in an attractive tin that is quite a bit larger than the products contained inside.  The three facial products are individually packaged and wrapped in some tissue paper for added protection.  My wife's first comment when she saw the product sizes, though, was that they were only samples.  I'm inclined to agree as the three products, especially the facial cleanser, are very small in size and probably won't last long at all.  That was disappointment number one.  The second disappointment was there was absolutely no information included in the tin or printed on the product boxes how to properly use them.  What little that was printed on the boxes was in several foreign languages, and it took great effort to find anything printed in English.  I was pleased to see there were some specific product directions for usage printed on Amazon's web page for each individual product, so I ended up copying and printing those off for my wife to use.

There are three basic products in this gift set: a small tube of facial cleanser/toner, an antioxidant serum intended to make skin smooth and radiant, and a night cream to make skin feel well rested on awakening the next day.  Vichy recommends using the facial cleanser morning & night, the antioxidant at any time during your beauty regimen, and the night cream before bed.  My wife tried the facial cleanser to remove makeup after wiping most of her makeup off with a pad.  She found that the cleanser did not remove all of her residual makeup, and she had to use it a second time to get it all off.  She has used the antioxidant and night cream as recommended but says that while her skin feels moisturized she has not noticed any other improvements in her skin.  Neither she nor I can appreciate any change in the visual appearance of her skin.  Overall, she was disappointed with the products and found them no more useful than what she was already using previously.

Obviously, there are other reviewers who have tried the products in this gift set and really like them.  My wife clearly did not perceive much benefit from them.  They are expensive, so this gift set is probably the best way to try them out for the lowest cost to see how you like them.  They can all be purchased separately and in different sizes.",1495065600,2017-05-18
4.0,"This stuff works really great, but is waaaay too expensive, imho, therefore minus one star.  As of this review a 3.4 oz. bottles costs $42.00.  I'll definitely use up this bottle but will go back to my regular hair gel afterwards.  But, if you can swing it then by all means buy it because I was very surprised to see what it made my hair do. Often times, products that say they will do blah blah blah for your hair frequently don't work like they say they will, but ORIBE did work like it said it would.

I have short hair now (so maybe my expensive bottle will last longer) and it rarely behaves like I want it too - always a battle.  I might not have used this in the correct way, but the results made me happy.  After I got out of the shower and toweled dry my hair (but still wet), I ran a small amount of the ORIBE through my hair and then blew it dry.  It felt stiffer, but I could still run my fingers through it and make it separate into a bunch of smaller sections that really looked nice!  I guess that's what is meant by ""pieciness"".

5.0,"First of all, I'm 39.  I am not vain and while I enjoy trying new products, I prefer to stick with proven basics as my skin and wallet are very sensitive.  I have noticed a few deeper lines/creases, particularly one large one under my left eye (I was sick for a few years and spent a great deal of time horizontal and on my side, which definitely exacerbated that one spot. I am not/was not bothered by it but my mother has pointed it out on a few occasions and she is the product junky/youth hound).  I still break out, so I'm usually battling that and it doesn't often occur to me that maybe my skin is showing general age as I'm just happy when I have a clear and comfortable skin day.

But I decided to try these as they are not fragranced and I was intrigued, though I was skeptical as my forehead and parentheses are non-issues, or so I thought.

I really like that these are so gentle and not smelly/perfumed; definitely a bonus with my hypersensitive, fair skin.  They are not drippy (like the Juice Beauty patches I reviewed earlier, which were nice but so wet).  They stick without any fuss.

And the results?  Wow. Just wow.  I have bangs so it's not like I'm going to actively invest time and money into my forehead, but even I was impressed by how luminous and youthful, plump and ironed and firm the skin looked.  The results were not as obvious on my parentheses, but still nice for a special day.  I also used one on my neck/under chin area and really liked the extra boost it gave that area, offering a mildly slimmer (temporarily) and tighter profile.

I will definitely keep these on hand for big days and special events. I'm especially thrilled as the lack of a strong odor definitely makes these friendly for my sensitive skin and allergy prone system.",1431302400,2015-05-11

Not a bad product per se, especially for those with flaws that require coverage.  But overall, a 3 star recommendation.",1498348800,2017-06-25
4.0,"I've had an oily/combination skin ever since my teens. I'm in my early 50's now, but still have breakouts. So, you can understand my hesitation about using an oil to cleanse my face. I rubbed a little oil between my hands and applied to my face. It's kind of an odd sensation to apply oil for cleansing, but it made my skin very soft and clean. I like the fact that this brand doesn't add chemicals to their products. My only reason for 4 stars is the scent of the product which is a little medicinal. I look forward to trying more in this line.",1414800000,2014-11-01
3.0,"Price aside, this curler works as well as my favorite Tarte curler. There's nothing particularly innovative here ... in fact, it's pretty utilitarian. Likewise, I'm dubious about its selling point (""gimmick?"") of lash conditioning with blue chamomile. Like other reviewers, I tried to locate replacement pads here, and could find none. Then I checked on Georgie's website, none there either. Since this aspect is what draws the attention of the consumer, it seems sage to offer a three-pack of replacement pads for a premium ... why not? It saves consumers from tossing/wasting a perfectly good device (I wipe mine down with alcohol about one every two weeks) and allows Georgie to capitalize on their claims. As in, ""these pads are so great, you'll want to pick up extra!""

As it stands, with no replacement parts to be found and it's perfectly average performance, I would say this is a solid three-star product. It's okay ... but there are cheaper, equally as effective curlers out there.",1434326400,2015-06-15

5.0,"This is a creamy, gradual self tanning lotion. It softens and makes your skin look and feel moisturized, without feeling greasy.  I applied it over my tan and I thought my skin looked radiant and soft.  It does have a slight smell, but not anything like any other self tanner I've used before.  I did have to allow for just a little more time, than with their mousse, but I just stood in front of my fan and that helped to dry it.  It contains over 6 ounces of product, so a little more product than what the mousse holds for the same price, and it moisturizers your skin.  Here is what the manufacturer says: ""A superbly hydrating lotion that applies clear for zero transfer onto clothing and then develops to a beautiful subtle glow that be deepened with daily use. Formulated with Aloe Vera & Shea Butter to soothe and moisturize.""",1469577600,2016-07-27

5.0,"This is a really nice, dense brush.  This is the first Japonesque brush I've used, and, based on my experience with this brush, their reputation for quality brushes is true.

Although it's listed here as a powder brush, the box states that it can be used for foundation, setting powder, or bronzer.  I've tried it for all three, and prefer it for powder and bronzer.  The bristles feel too fluffy to make your foundation go on in an airbrushed way, which is the look I prefer.

For point of reference, I'm including a photo of this next to my MAC 187 stipple brush and my Sonia Kashuk blush brush.  The Japonesque brush is the same length, but you can see how the brush tapers in at the head.  This makes it ideal for getting powder into hard-to-reach areas on the face, and it deposits both powder and powder bronzer lightly.

You open the pack, set of two pads, pour the vial into the little container holding the kidney bean shaped pads (one for each eye) and let it set for a minute or two while it sops up the fluid from the vial. Then place each pad under your eye. Be ready with a paper towel or something to sop up the fluids that will continuously run down your face during the time you are supposed to leave it there. At the end of the time take the pads off and supposedly you will see less wrinkles. The wrinkle and puffiness reduction...totally not sure on that account but very sure on the messiness. Really quite pricey. It also doesn't smell all that great, however the scent really doesn't linger and is not all that strong.

The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol.

As I have gotten older, my lips have become thinner (unlike the rest of me), and those little lines that my mom and grandma had started to appear on my own face (oh, the horror!).
After 3 solid weeks of use, I can tell you that this product did poof up my lips noticeably, (but not obnoxiously) and did it without burning or irritation (unlike previous versions I has tried). The lines decreased, too. I used it once in the morning and once at night, and did occasionally use it during the day, too. I used a little lip liner and then rubbed it in to get rid of the harsh lip liner look. It worked great...and now it will be part of my daily regimen.

Obagi toner is so gentle. It can go over the most sensitive or irritated skin. It is soothing. There is no stingy alcohol feeling. There is a little bit of a witch hazel smell but it is very mild. I didn't actually think it was doing anything because it was so mild. But it does leave skin smooth, pores minimized, and ready for the next step in your routine. The bottle is nice and big.

The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.

5.0,"The numerous pictures provided on the product page along with the ones others have posted provide an accurate run-down of the contents of this sample box so I had a general idea what to expect and was not disappointed. The main differences from what is presented are things like the flavor of the toothpaste sample and nail polish color, etc.

These are samples that are sometimes offered or available in high-end department stores but instead of making multiple trips to the brick and mortar locations, all are gathered here and the cost of the box is reimbursed with a credit to be used on the purchase of selected items within this product class.

The Julep nail polish color varies. I received a gorgeous shade of blue (Nedra-It Girl) which is one I would have selected for purchase. I have a couple of bottles of their polish and this is a full-size container, not a sample, and it costs approximately 2/3 the price of the entire sample box alone, and that is over-and-above the credit toward a future purchase within the selected group.

So, for me this sample box idea is a win because even with items that may not initially be of interest, I rarely refuse a free sample since in the past I have discovered helpful items I did not know about and even switched brands after trying something new. And, I can check for skin sensitivities with a sample before purchase. So that the box is not customized is not a primary concern. .

Specific contents within the 20 samples I received include two mens cologne and a shaving cream sample but otherwise the contents are either generic, like the toothpaste, or are plainly products marketed to women. I received three cologne samples I was curious about, one which I liked enough that I plan to buy more. The Ahava product I received was a 1.3 ounce tube of their hand cream, something I wanted to try and was impressed. Overall very pleased.",1483747200,2017-01-07

I only use a bit during the day and it lasts even in the hot, sweaty days of summer. I touch it up again if I'm heading back out in the evening. It blends easily with fingers or a sponge and offers pretty good coverage. The Pale Ivory is very light but I'm pretty pale so it works ok. I add a bronzer during the summer. I've used it daily for about a month and have only used a tiny bit. I imagine this container will last at least six months, probably more.

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

I wanted to try this because I am always on the lookout for something better to help me with this annoying problem I have. The consistency of this lip balm is more inline with Carmex where Chapstick and Blistex have more of a thick layered consistency. Because of the super dry feel of my lips, I prefer the thicker consistency.

This may be a great product for sun protection with the SPF 45, but if you are battling the aggravating feeling of dried out lips this won't sooth that feeling. It fees like it is just sitting on top of my lips and not providing relief to the dry feeling.",1502582400,2017-08-13

3.0,"I want to like this hand lotion more than I do, but I can't be very excited about it enough to want to purchase it. What's good about it is it's a thick, emollient hand lotion that when applied softens my hands--but so do many other hand lotions for half the price and at a better scent. What makes it not exciting is that for the price at this size (see photo), it doesn't live up to that price standard. I think the marketers/creators of this hand lotion should give it an exotic spicy scent, or something citrus, or woodsy, so that, like another well-known brand sold in hair salons, there is that feeling of decadence or a ""spa-like"" experience. This lotion's scent is like grandma (and I'm a grandmother, but I don't want to smell like MY grandmother). There is also an almost ""chemical"" scent to the ""grandma flowery"" scent. As well, it takes a while for the lotion to soak into my skin, so if I'm at my computer working on a novel, I have to wait a while--it's a little greasy--yet, that wouldn't be so bad since when it does soak in, my hands do feel great.

So, in general, give this lotion an ""exotic"" or citrus'y scent and/or give a little bit more for the money, and I'd be more inclined to purchase it. Honestly, just changing the scent would do a lot to pique my interest in this product.",1433289600,2015-06-03

5.0,"I absolutely love Mustela products.  I have very sensitive, eczema prone skin and this stuff is seriously the best ever!  If you know what I'm talking about, you understand how unbearable an outbreak can be.  This not only soothes and cleanses my skin but it heals it.  I'm not sure what it is that makes everything calm and moisturized but I LOVE IT.  I buy other Mustela products for my granddaughter who has extremely sensitive skin and will not buy anything else. It provides the needed moisture and calm that the skin is craving.  I can't explain what it does but what I do know, is the skin calms down, it accepts the moisture and your skin thanks you.  I'm in love with this skin care line!

If you have a baby, teen, adult, it doesn't matter.  Anyone that you know that suffers with eczema or sensitive skin condition, Mustela can set you back on track.  I'm a life long fan and will never go back.

Highly Recommend!",1493510400,2017-04-30
4.0,"Works. Is it painful, well ... sorta. The reality of this particular skin treatment is that it does cause pain when you use it. The good news is that it does work to help create better looking skin. I used it for about 2 weeks on some wrinkles on my face and they definitely improved.  The device is super easy to use and charge, and the set up is really nice. The stand is great, it has a great firm hold on the ""wand"" and it looks nice in the bathroom.

The bad news is that it hurts. I think the better way to describe it is between a sting and a sharp burn. But it isn't overwhelming and you can certainly handle it. Now if you are super sensitive to pain and are not really into clearing some skin issues up, then you will not be motivated to do it. But if you are motivated and want results, then you will be bale to easily handle the sting and you will be happy with what results.

Also, be aware that this is not the equivalent of a face lift. This seems to work best on smaller areas.",1453334400,2016-01-21

This is quite pricey for a small tube of a product with olive oil in it just to do 'touch-ups'. Whether this is a gimmick, I'm not sure- but it worked ok but then again why do you need this to fix your make up or do a touch up? I'm sure I can think of other ways to do it that aren't as expensive. An Interesting idea but I wouldn't say it's a requirement to have this to do touch ups.

However, the price really is a deciding factor for me when considering the Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base, especially considering that it's less than an ounce in size and doesnt replace foundation makeup.

I tested this by using it on one side of my face and following my usual daily regimen on the other side, and I could definitely feel a difference.  They started out very similar, but the Water Canvas Base side stayed smoother throughout the day and did provide a better base for makeup.  The results weren't astounding, but they were noticeable.

However, Id have to see a much bigger difference before I would consider this to be worth using regularly at this price point.  For under $20, I would probably add it to my makeup routine.  For over $40, I wouldnt even consider it.",1393372800,2014-02-26

3.0,"This product is a cheap luxury.  While most of us aren't able to use it while lounging on the upper sundeck of our private yacht, we can afford a higher-priced tube of lip balm in our more mundane lives. But is it worth it?

Not in my opinion.  I love the smell and taste of it, and it has lots of nice natural ingredients, but it also has some that don't sound so nice.  The first ingredient is isododecane, and I couldn't figure out what that is other than being a hydrocarbon.  Is that good or bad?  Because this claims to be a ""natural lip balm,"" I wish Baxter had explained this ingredient.

Okay, I'm no chemist, so I'll have to judge this on how it works for me.  Again - smell and taste - I love it.  Efficiency?  Medium.  It seemed to wear off fairly quickly, but it did leave my lips soft.  It was easy to squeeze too much product out of the tube, so care needs to be taken not to do that.

Now, the main reason I won't get this product again.  I really, really don't like the sticky feeling it leaves on my lips.  For those who don't mind that, this might be a good product, but for me, it's a deal-breaker.  I'll probably use the rest of the tube at night before I go to bed, just to not waste it, but I'm going to stick to my non-luxury, next-to-the-cash-register bargain lip balms.

By the way, Baxter of California started by creating a gender-specific product, one for men, and continued in that direction.  This product didn't say anything about being just for men.

Which would be easy to do if they didn't wrap an adhesive ingredient label around the end where the plastic cap for the eyeliner is located. I broke 2 of my nails, and nearly cut my finger trying to remove this sticker from the plastic cap. I was never able to, so it looks like crap with the label partially wrapped around the cap. Also, you need a sharpener for this pencil, it's not the auto-sharpen type which I like more.

4.0,"I have used a couple IPL systems before, including a different Silk'n model and the Philips Lumea.  Both work well, and I was excited to try out this system that promised to be more compact for getting into tight places.  Unfortunately, it is almost identical to the Lumea, and I don't say that to be dramatic.  It is seemingly the same unit with a purple trim portion and carrying case.  Thankfully, the Lumea is a nice unit, but my hopes of a smaller detail hair removal tool were dashed.  My guess is that only very specific models have been FDA approved, limiting the diversity in home systems.

If you are new to IPL, I will try to give a brief overview.  The IPL system has emits a burst of light at a frequency that is absorbed by pigmented areas, with the goal being to heat up the base of the hair follicles enough to damage them.  With repeated use over months and years, the hair will grow back thinner and more slowly, making it much easier to keep smooth.  So, this will only work on relatively light skin and relatively dark hair.  If your skin is dark, it will absorb the light before it gets to the hair root.  That means it won't work, plus it might burn you.  The more pigmented areas of the body like the genitals or thicker hair density areas like a man's face are not advised for these home systems, but certainly they are done with more powerful systems in a clinical setting.  I think the main point of that warning is to avoid liability.  If you choose to do it anyway, start with the lower intensity light to make sure you don't burn yourself.

As with the Lumea, you can hold the button down between flashes to cause it to flash as soon as it is ready.  That makes going over large areas easier than the original Silk'n.  Since it has the same shape head, with a large border, it is awkward to use under the nose or other creases.  However, it can be done.  Even large areas are pretty quick and the pain isn't bad if you have pale skin.

For home use, this is as good as it gets right now.  It's still a bit clunky and low powered compared to professional treatments, but persistence does pay off.  Don't expect quick results and be disciplined and you'll likely be pleased.  The main alternative is doing electrolysis, but I find that challenging without causing scarring on myself.",1466380800,2016-06-20

5.0,"I really like this mousse.  It makes my hair more voluminous and gives it some added thickness.  I can definitely tell the difference when I use it.  It adds tons of body and a nice amount of hold so that when I use the curling iron my waves stay in place for several days.  I'm pretty generous with the amount I use because my hair is hard to hold so I need the extra oomph and control.  I then let my hair air dry overnight.  In the morning it's a little stiff but it brushes right out and once I've done the waves, it has plenty of bounce.  I finish with Bumble and Bumble Thickening Creme Contour, which adds a little bit of hold but also some additional thickness and separation.  The two products together are awesome and my hair has never looked better.  I don't even need to recurl it on the 2nd or 3rd day because it stays in place so well.  I've tried other thickening mousse formulas but always come back to this one.  It gives my hair some added heft and dimension and the volume is terrific.  Who could ask for more?  This is an awesome product and great for fine hair.  If you're looking for a product with a thickening effect, then you can't do better than this one.  I definitely recommend it for all hair types.",1459296000,2016-03-30
1.0,"Really disappointed. Two hairdressers RAVED about Oribe, as if it was the best brand ever. I'm unimpressed. First of all, I bought it quickly, thinking I bought shampoo. It was bad enough as shampoo - i.e., I was disappointed that it didn't leave my hair soft and it really didn't brighten it. And, since I have super curly hair, I frequently use conditioner to wash my hair. When I realized this was conditioner, I was more than disappointed. Talk about drying out my hair!  What a waste of money.

The smell is ok, a bit too perfumey for me. I specifically purchased it for use with keratin treated hair. While this claims to be safe for keratin, the second time I used it I noticed that my hair was starting to get frizzy. I found this to be really upsetting as I'm only 6 weeks into a keratin treatment, and it's winter, and keratin usually lasts me easily 3 months through a steamy summer. I can't say for sure that this was the cause, as each keratin treatment and product is different, and I've had 3 different keratin products over the past 9 months. Frankly, even if this worked really well, the price is outrageously absurd and I've had better luck with drugstore purple shampoos and conditioners. No more Oribe for me.",1514678400,2017-12-31

Enter L'Occitane Shea Cleansing Oil. This light, golden-colored oil is long-lasting, easy to use, and effectively removed my tinted moisturizer, concealer, and blush.

To use it, I wet my face and use one pump of the oil to cover and cleanse my face. Then I rinse thoroughly. All traces of my makeup are removed. (I don't use waterproof makeup, but the directions say the product will remove even waterproof makeup.)

The scent of the product is subtle and pleasant but does not linger when rinsed off. It contains 5% Shea oil, along with sunflower oil, but no ""scary"" chemicals.

After use, my face is almost smooth enough to skip moisturizer. (I don't skip it, but others might be able to.)

Even at the price of $22 for 6.7 fl. oz., this is worth trying. A bottle will last you quite a while (used once daily, as I do), and like me, you'll probably want to keep on using it.",1428796800,2015-04-12

5.0,"I'm a big fan of Dermablend.  The creams and lotions blend well with other shades and on the skin for a natural look.  Bruises and skin discolorations are well concealed.  The blend lasts a few hours before one notices the creams crease in pores.  This is great for face, arms and legs and works well in photography.  I've never had a bad reaction from this brand.",1504828800,2017-09-08
4.0,"I have mature, sun damaged skin (from the days when we used timers to tell us when to roll over and bake the other side) so I have to be very careful in the sun.  I have fair, freckled, sensitive skin that is also dry.

I like this.  It has a scent that does not bother my allergies.  A small amount is all it takes and it does absorb into the skin.  Just don't slather it on or you'll have a streaked mess.  It has a nice tint and on the days I wear it, it is all I wear.

The tube will last a while unless the wearer uses it all day every day and then the replacement price might be a bit of a problem, but for the knowledge that it is blocking harmful rays, it's worth it.",1487894400,2017-02-24

4.0,"This felt more like perfumed water, with some glycerin and moisturizers added. My face doesn't feel dry anymore after using astringent followed by the Vichy, and it isn't greasy or thick. I felt it might have been better if it were a cleanser and moisturizer but some might feel it compromises too much on either aspect - or perhaps some menthol added for a soothing effect.

5.0,"I love to have candles around for ambiance and to add a pleasant scent to the house or just one room.  The Baxter Noir candle in Cassis is very eye catching in its design, as even the carton was unique with its embossed text and textured paper.  The candle wax is just as jet black as appears in the photo, which in person really stands out amongst the other candles.  When burning, the scent was an excellent amount that filled up a large area (living room and dining room) which a slightly citrusy and fig aroma that was not overly sweet or overbearing in any way.  I've found many candles don't always burn so evenly, however the Baxter one after about 2-3 hours of initial burn, is looking as smooth on the surface as when it was new.",1390348800,2014-01-22
5.0,"This tanning mist is really great. I had some doubts when I first used it because of the spray/mist instead of a cream. The spray is much like sunscreen, and very easy to use. I noticed within a few hours the subtle changes to the tone of my skin. After using the mist for a few days, it did look like I had a real tan and not a fake on. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a tan but doesn't want to sit under the sun for hours to get it.

1. Light.
2. Creamy but not greasy.
3. Mild refreshing scent.

6. Clean and stylish packaging.

Cons
1. Small tube - barely 2.5 oz.
2. Expensive ($25 bucks for 2.5 oz - whew)

5.0,at covering thinning areas of hair. I've never tried any other brand of hair building fibers but this one covers and blends well. Looks like your hair if you match the color properly.

2.0,"I really don't like this cleanser. It's hard to squeeze out a really small dab, and anything marble-sized or bigger ends up being way too much product.  It neither lathers well nor is a creamy cleanser, plus it's kind of slimy, so it's kind of the worst of all worlds.  It does leave my face clean, I will give it that, and my skin hasn't been irritated.  I need a separate product for eye makeup.  I have no idea why it's called ""rejuvenation"" because my face does not look younger upon use, but if anything feels dry and tight, and really crying out for moisturizer.  So it's not a fantastic product for me.",1490313600,2017-03-24
4.0,"Very nice blush in a ""lightish"" rosy color.  The blush was well-packed, and out of the boxes (sort of generic-looking) comes a nice, metal case with a pretty design, in the color of this blush shade #3.  It is easy to open, and the blush is fine and well-pressed. In other words it is not loose at all.  I already have a shade of coral in an expensive brand, and this differs in that it is a subtle blush.  Of course you can build up the color, and for this price it is a lovely deal.  I would compare it to generic brands at the beauty supply.  Not too difficult to get color transfer, but not a gawdy mess either.  I still prefer cover girl, because of the shimmer, but really this does not crumble like that one either.  I used a large blush brush, and I put a bit on my cheekbones, and a bit on my nose tip and chin, and I have a shimmer powder that I put over that.  Just a bit so my wrinkles do not get too pronounced.  Recommended!",1415404800,2014-11-08

Decided to switch and gave MenScience a try.  First off no scent going on which I like, I don't need scented deodrant as I wear cologne.  Second it lasts all day when I get home from work I don't have any unpleasant odor coming from the underarm area.  Finally not staing my tshirts.

Hair spray never does does trick, and hair gel just makes my hair look like I just sprayed a coating of shellac on my head.  A small dollop of WOW evenly distributed on my head after putting it up keeps my hairs down all day long.  It slides on smoothly and no greasy reside or look left behind.

The only question I have is if it can be used with flat irons?  There is no mention of it anywhere.",1460332800,2016-04-11

I definitely won't buy this color again.
As far as vinylux goes I love the vinylux polishes. They last much longer than the regular polish and are much easier to take off. This color stayed on very well for 7 days. Sometimes the polish will wear at the tips and very rarely have a small chip at the tips but usually by that time I am ready to change the color anyway.",1401667200,2014-06-02
5.0,"This thermal brush simply works......with a few caveats.

For most hair this brush will work and probably work great.  However, if you have really thick hair, your results may be not as good as those with thin hair might obtain.  This has been the experience in our household of three girls.  If you have thicker hair, I recommend allowing for more time to work with the brush. In our experience, the brush does provide volume and the volume seems to stay in place in most conditions.

The brush itself is constructed very well and comes very securely packed.  It includes a storage/travel pouch that is better than most.  Instructions are also included of course.  The brush heats very quickly and the settings are easy to use.",1457740800,2016-03-12
4.0,"I wanted to try this Eau de Toilette spray from John Varvados on myself first.  Why?  Because it is my nose that smells my husband's scent.  He is not one who often puts anything on except aftershave, and I am picky in terms of anything scent.
This Eau de Toilette spray starts out with a fesh citrus scent.  But now, four hours later, I can only detect the wood and sweet undertones which now dominate.  The citrus has retreated far into the background.

Perfumes and Eau de Colognes/Toilette sprays interact with body chemistry, so it never smells the same on another person.  I am curious how it will smell on my husband.

I read reviews that claimed that this spray does not last all day.  But four hours later it is still going quite strong.  Cold it be that the wearer's nose just can't discern it anymore?  That seems to happen with habitual perfume wearers, and some end up dousing themselves to the point of fumigating their entire surroundings.  Please, never do that, just because you don't smell it doesn't mean it's not there anymore.  And a lot of people are quite sensitive to perfumes and can get sick.

I do like the scent of this spray.  While it comes through as sweet, it still has a masculine property about it.

The packaging is very handsome with the bottle enclosed in wicker.",1457568000,2016-03-10
4.0,"This V76 Tex is a really good product. I'm a gal w medium length layered hair, and I started using a lot of men's hair products when my hair was short- I'm particularly fond of these texture pastes that prevent flyaways and give your hair a more manageable feel- your hair stays better where you want it. V76 is natural looking since it's not shiny or oily or slick or crispy on your hair. I often use Sebastian's texurizing products, like their Matte Putty, and this is very similar. I don't love the smell of this so much- a bit like a plastic barbie once it's on my head (smells better in the jar), but it's mild enough to not be unpleasant. This has no fiber in it, so you can't sculpt your hair too much- just mainly gives you a look and feel like you've not washed your hair in a day, but without the oily part from your scalp-looks very smooth and not puffy. V76 is also water soluble and not sticky, so i add a little bit of it- like a fingertip amt. to water in my hands, and run it through the ends of my hair- or just add some directly when my hair's still wet out of the shower.",1479427200,2016-11-18
4.0,"This is a pleasant scent. It only takes one spray, so be careful. The scent is soft, not harsh. It stays on my skin all day, but does not take over a room as some scents do.

3.0,"This is an impressive little white compact with mirror that can be thrown in a bag and easily found.  My compact was thrown into a drawer and repeatedly jostled for a month without any issues.

I gave the product only three stars because the shade of BUFF is just too yellow/orange for my light skin tone.  As much as I attempted to bled you were able to see where I had used the powder.  My other complaint is that I find it to clog my pores and not go on in a smooth fashion; at least not on my face!  I tested on the inside of my wrist and it blended rather nicely.  It was smooth but not dried out.  When I wet my arm It did not run, nor streak.

I believe the issue has to do with the fact that I have large problematic pores.  The powder feels dry when applying to my face and it seems caked, especially in the nose region.  Personally I cannot use this shade or apply for the advertised flawless finish.  My face appeared cakey, feathery and dry.

Do not recommend this shade if you are light skinned ir if you have large pores.  You will find that it clogs your face and leaves it feeling dry.  I really did want to like it.",1420329600,2015-01-04

This is a so-so daily cream cleanser, that does an OK job of cleaning, while leaving your face feeling soft, but fails the test of clean mascara removal, something any $5 jar of cold cream can do with similar soft skin benefits.

As a mask this was equally lackluster. It doesn't spread all that well over your skin, and it never dries. After leaving it on about 15 minutes, I rinsed it off, and my skin was soft and felt hydrated, but it definitely wasn't special enough to justify the incredibly high price tag.

For my skin type I need to do a cleansing/drawing mask at least once or twice a month.

This really made the pores on the sides of my nose look smaller. It just made my face feel cleaner too. I also liked the sea-type of scent, it was a masculine scent, just a fresh, sea-mineral, type of scent. I left it on longer than it called for, but, it didn't seem to strip my skin of all moisture.

5.0,"This spray is the first and only Wen product I've ever used and it's the best leave in spray I've ever used! When sprayed into my hair after showering, my hair is easy to comb and manage. I do use 3 other products in my hair after using this, but the combination without this spray is definitely not the same. My hair absolutely loves this spray.
I have naturally straight hair with certain areas that are naturally wavy. Finding products that tame my frizz and wonky wavy bits effectively without weighing down my hair with product has been a constant battle until I bought and tried this for the first time. This spray is so lightweight and manages to tame the areas that wanna do their own thing whether I air dry or blow dry my hair.

This spray smells amazing. It's not too sweet, and has a clean minty scent that is light, clean, and herb-like fresh. It's not heavy or cloying.

This really makes my hair look fantastic, feel fantastic and makes such a huge difference in my haircare regime. My hair is easier to style, feels nourished, is shiny and healthy looking, and retains body and bounce.
I used this spray on my friends hair for her wedding before setting her hair in curlers. Her normally fine, wavy and frizzy hair was full of luscious, smooth and glossy curls that lasted all day. She looked like a princess. It came out better than I ever could have hoped.

It's completely expensive yes, but it does last a long time. I just ordered my second bottle. My first bottle I got back in the beginning of April of this year and just recently finished that bottle. I use a good 6-8 sprays in my armpit length hair and I wash my hair 3 times a week. To me that feels like a worthwhile amount of uses for the price.
The price, IMO, is a little insane but the price of Wen is a little insane anyway. It did make me cringe a bit when I had to repurchase, but all the things I was trying instead weren't working anywhere near as well and I'd much rather pay more for something that works instead of keep buying cheaper products that don't (and end up adding up to the original cost in the first place).

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17
4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

4.0,"This product comes in an elegant, easy-to-open, jar. A spoon comes with it, in order to easily remove the product from the jar.

The masque, itself, is a thick cream having the consistency of paste. It is not greasy. It has a light, somewhat floral scent.  The masque goes on easily. I found that I didn't have to use a lot of the product either. Because of its consistency, it is easy to apply. I divided my very long hair into sections to make it easier.. Each strand needs to be covered, and using a thick-toothed comb to distribute it evenly is helpful.

Now, for the results. It did tame the frizzies, but it didn't get rid of them all together. It did improve the quality of my hair. It felt softer, stronger, easier to manage. It seemed to be hydrated without feeling greasy.

I can't decide which one it smells like, but the smell itself I would buy this stuff for!

Content is decent; I still wish it would keep the alcohols and other drying contents out of it... especially for the price of it.

She sat down with my daughter and applied makeup to her(to her great delight) and had a ball. Although a few of the colors broke up a little bit but most of them there were no problems.

I've tried lighter formulas that had an overpowering scent and they not only didn't minimize fine lines but they sometimes made my eyes water a bit.  It will take longer for me to know if it will work on my fine lines.  What I would love to see, and so far no product has done this, is a little less puffiness around my eyes.

4.0,"I live in Florida where sun exposure is a given. I'm not a big beach person, but v-neck t-shirts and tanks tops have been staples in my wardrobe on and off throughout my life here. Which means that skin between my shoulder blades has seen its share of sun--and I'm quite fair skinned.

So, I can't say that I've seen any real difference as far as eliminating creases in the area, but I would say I like this very much simply as a skin cream. It's thick, but soaks in quickly and doesn't leave a greasy feel at all, and a little goes a long way. The scent isn't my favorite--it reminds me of the scented powder my grandmother used to wear and I really don't want to smell like a grandmother in my 40s--but the scent also dissipates rather quickly. The amount of product you get for the price is pretty good as well. I'd say I recommend it as a nice skin cream, but don't expect miracles.",1465948800,2016-06-15

4.0,"This serum is pleasant to apply, goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  It does not leave any stickiness and does not tighten my combination skin.  For me, it seems to smooth out the surface of my skin and leaves it very soft.  It provides a very nice base for my very lightweight moisturizer and equally lightweight foundation.

BUT, the company's general and somewhat ambiguous claims of its benefits, and the mystery surrounding the ingredients gives me pause.  At the time I write this review, the long list of ingredients is not shown on this product page.  And, what does ""softens"" fine and ""dry"" lines and wrinkles mean?  And is the ""luminous glow"" from the orange tint in the serum or from a useful ingredient?  And what ingredients in particular ""even skin tone""?

It has an orange tint to it, that may give a slight ""glow"" to my skin.  I've tried some other serums that were surprisingly orange--almost neon orange--that tinted my skin an unnatural orange tint.  This is not that way.  This is a color that provides an almost mental pleasant experience, not visible on the skin.  The fragrance is a very pleasant orange, too.

I have a gripe with the ingredient list:  Bliss does not list it here on the product page.  I would like to see it here--in a decent size type face--so I can investigate the ingredients.  The ingredient list is on the box, in the smallest type imaginable.  I did get out my magnifying glass, thinking that I would look them up, list them in my review and tell you about them.  After a half hour, I've given up.  The list is long.  The ingredients are not familiar and not much info is available.  So, sorry.  I've given up.  I will say that I do NOT see any of my favorite serum ingredients:  Vitamin C, witch hazel, plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid.  There is yeast from black tea ferment, cranberry extract, some bark extracts and more.  I think the company should explain away some of the mystery of what is included in this serum.

Bottom line:  So far, so good with this serum.  I think it is worth a try, and it is a pleasure to apply.  So far, no bad effects like blemishes, tight skin, or stickiness.  Heck, it took almost two months to see the wonderful effects of simple witch hazel on the dark spots on my facial skin.  So I know that I need patience to see results with any serum.",1448841600,2015-11-30

I use the Deep Pore normally---it's the same as the sensitive but it has longer bristles. I like that both the Deep Pore and the Sensitive work on my face without any kind of abrasion or irritation. I have some sebaceous hyperplasia now and these heads don't cause any problems with it at all. Ever since forays into buying Clarisonic replacement heads on (auction sites and on here) resulted in fake heads I've not purchased anywhere but Ulta.

I usually use a  brush to apply my makeup but I do find the enclosed sponge applicator works just as well if not better. The bronze color is darker than I usually use but it gives a look of being out in the sun-tanning look so I would use this more in the summer. The compact case it comes in is black in color. It comes with a mirror and a separate compartment under the powder to store the applicator sponge which I find really a nice touch.  If you are new to the Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics as I am I would recommend trying it.

5.0,"So, as I was searching the internet one night for a product to help my adult cystic acne, I came across these glycolic acid treatment pads. The reviews were great, and they were also supposed to help with fine lines and wrinkles! I was VERY skeptical for sure, but I was also desperate, so I ordered them.

After one week of using this product, I noticed my pores were definitely not as noticeable and my acne was greatly improving! I was still thinking there's no way this product is this great! I also noticed that my skin looked brighter and healthier as well.

So, I was nearing the end of the jar, and I began to notice that my forehead lines were softening and my laugh lines were also not as noticeable as before. I was officially sold on this product! Not only had it basically cleared up my skin (aside from a hormonal related pimple here and there near my cycle), but my skin also appeared so much more youthful!

I am so excited about this product and hope that everyone suffering from adult acne will give it a shot! I know everyone's skin is different, and what worked for me may not work for everyone. However, this product will help exfoliate and cleanse the dirt and grime away from your skin no matter what. So, it definitely won't hurt to try, and it's a great value as well. I am definitely singing the praises of my new found go-to product for acne and wrinkles!

This product may cause stinging when you first begin to use it, especially if you have never used glycolic acid products before. If you have sensitive skin, it may be best to start with either this strength (15%) or the 10% to allow your skin to get used to the glycolic acid before moving up to the higher 20% strength. The burning and tingling doesn't last long, and you will begin to notice that it doesn't seem to burn after using it several times.

Bottom line: try these if you're looking for something to help rid you of stubborn adult acne, or if you're simply looking for something to help with anti-aging or to help with wrinkles that have already formed. This product really is great!",1434067200,2015-06-12

5.0,I work at a drugstore and we have hundreds  of choices of nail color to choose from.  Getting use to the limited color choices of CND Shellac and the high cost has made me very selective in ordering their polish.  This was surely a winner.  It is so hard to judge from the online photos but CND website has a little screen that shows all the various colors side by side for comparison.  This is a bright summery coral that has some pink undertones.  It is not neon and really matches with most everything I have worn.  I love how CND Shellac smoothes out the ridges and makes your toes look so pretty.,1336435200,2012-05-08

The compact includes a sponge and mirror and is very nice quality.
It is perfect for toting around in a purse or when traveling.
The ""nude"" shade is a good neutral - no hints of yellow or pink undertones.

5.0,"This smells wonderful to me - it is like neroli, or like being in the midst of a Florida orange orchard in full bloom.  I simply love the fragrance, but it is strong, and if you are sensitive to fragrances, you may not like this one.  I love fragrances, the more the better, and I am in love the scent.

The cream itself is light, like a mousse.  It's very moisturizing, and my skin just soaks it up.  It immediately smooths out the finest of lines, and undereye crepe, which is a big problem for me.  This works better than my eye cream for my undereye area.

The jar itself is basic, plastic, and easy to open and use.  It has a wide top so it is easy to get every bit of product from the jar.  The expiration date on mine is over a year in the future.

Downside- it contains a good bit of glycerin and dimethicone. so it can react with some makeup, spf, or other skin products to cause piling when used together.  Sometimes this is avoided by waiting longer after application, but a lot depends on the products being mixed.  This is not working well for me with my SPF products, so that limits my use to days that I stay in and don't wear SPF, or use later at night after I've washed my face for the day.  Otherwise, the piling is so bad it all just rubs off like my skin is peeling.  Still, I find it just SO pleasant to use, that I simply love it.",1433462400,2015-06-05

I only use a small amount of this oil, and I spread it very lightly across my hands. Then I pat it only the outer layer of my hair. I do not use a conditioner, but do use a color-safe shampoo (I like ISO these days).
Who knew that an oil could do this? Plus it adds some shine and helps tame the frizz I have in a few spots. And it helps detangle.
(Probably not conditioning enough for course or very frizzy hair. But those kinds of products would turn MY hair into a flat oil slick!)

A note on the ingredients: unlike, say, Argan Oil, this product contains more than oil and, surprisingly, a lot of silicone in various forms. But it works, so I'm hangin' with it!

A little of this stuff goes a long way.  I just take out a little larger than a pea size and rub it between both palms then lightly smooth it over the problem area/s.  While it straightens it significantly it doesn't always make it completely straight.  I like that it doesn't give a greasy/dirty sheen to your hair -if you do a light coating.  It you do a heavy coating it will look matted and greasy and you'll want to wash your hair.  It is best to do a light coating then add more gradually if you need more.  My main issue is not with the product but rather the packaging.  The cream is thick almost like a cold cream in texture.  However,  I wish it was easy and more hygienic way to remove it from its holder.  If it came as a pump or dispensed easier I would find it less messy to handle.  The flimsy screw top doesn't have many threads and since you hands are already coated with the cream it can be difficult to get the lid secure after use-many times the lid has fallen to the floor and gotten dirty because I couldn't screw it on properly.  It also has a faint chemically and flowery scent that isn't too strong but may turn off those who don't like fragrance or are hypo allergic.  However, I have found that is is not noticeable 5-10 minutes after application.
Overall, I have added this cream to my beauty care regime when my hair isn't behaving.  While it doesn't completely tame the frizz it keeps a lot of it under control and certainly looks better.  I just wish it was easier to get out and had a better dispenser.",1491350400,2017-04-05

4.0,"A somewhat ""perfumey"" scented lotion type white balm in attractive packaging. It is supposed to help with anti aging of my neck area. First thing I have to say is that it could be a little more generously  portioned since it's for the entire neck area I need to use more of it than what I would normally disperse, for say, an eye cream. So seeing as how this product is only 1.6 oz I did not to get even a full month's use out of it when applying it everyday to the neck/throat area.

That being said I DO like the fact that it contains so many natural ingredients: sea Buckthorn, tree fern, mimosa flower extract, macadamia seed oil and padina pavonica among others. It feels good on my skin and I noticed NO sensitivities to it even though I normally do have fairly sensitive skin and rosacea.

This balm immediately helped my skin feel hydrated and moisturized. It's a little too expensive for me to buy as a regular beauty item. At almost $80 a bottle I could not afford this regimen just to keep my neck looking younger. So unless you have a pretty thick budget then this really wouldn't be a practical product for you. Four stars for a very luxurious product but minus a star for the exorbitant price and the fact that I didn't really see any results after using the entire bottle except for a smoother and  hydrated neck area.",1504051200,2017-08-30

I reserve this moisturizer for if I know I'm actually going to be walking around in the sun (rather than just a normal day where I want to put on some moisturizer that happens to also have SPF15 in it, like some of the other brands I use).

Now, this is the the proverbial ""real deal."" It is genuinely full-coverage. Therefore, if possible, apply extremely lightly. Then use a Beauty Blender to blend. And, keep blending. Then, apply just a little extra with a brush to areas that require more attention (a tattoo, a blemish, a birthmark, etc.). Then gently blend that (especially around the edges). Use a loose translucent powder to set this. Put it on with a dusting of a brush if you have dry to normal skin ... if you skin is oily, gently press it on with a powder puff.

You can achieve a natural look if you build the coverage very slowly and very carefully. Take your time with this and you will be very surprised.",1501545600,2017-08-01

As a hair spray, it has a light hold to it. It sprays a fine mist and holds the hair without being stiff, crunchy or tacky. Very nice and natural looking.

I really like this product. I wouldn't use it everyday though since I don't like to wear a cologne smell all the time. That said, it is great for the special occasions when I want to look good and smell nice. It's pricey but worth it for the scent alone (for me).",1478304000,2016-11-05

4.0,"""kur"" by Londontown works well, particularly for someone who does a lot of housework/has hands in water, etc. but still wants their nails to stay nice. It is a very good base coat and does help the polish hold up.

Simply by virtue of using a basecoat alone, you can help the condition of your fingernails, since some nail polish ingredients can dry out nails.

I don't read anything in the ingredient list that is really going to lend itself to conditioning the nail, or at least those ingredients are fairly far down the ingredient list. Not that I think kur is not helpful, but I think it's value is as a quality basecoat, not a conditioner. I would suggest periodic treatment with a nail moisturizer, or even good old olive oil, to help condition nails and the surrounding area.

The product odor is no worse than your typical nail polish product. It does dry evenly and is very long lasting, and the overlying polish absolutely holds up a little better than with store brand base coat.",1447891200,2015-11-19

Please note that I have strawberry blonde hair and brows so I was looking for the best fit for someone who has my hair color. My skin is also very, very pale. I found that the color of this pencil was a pretty good fit for me, though it was a little bit even in tone so I had to be careful to use it mainly for fill and to feather strokes along the outside to blend in.

In terms of how it goes on, It seemed pretty smooth for me. It's not creamy so it doesn't flake or go on too thick or too dark. This did make it easier to do the aforementioned feathering. The brush on the end makes it easy to shape brows or to more evenly distribute the pencil that applies directly to brow hair (as it can do a bit of spreading like a mascara brush, though not nearly as thickly or as wetly).

In terms of weak points, I didn't really find any significant ones from my perspective. It is an expensive pencil, but given that it's a bit dry, it doesn't need to be sharpened as often as it doesn't wear down as quickly as a softer pencil. I think that it probably is better than some of the other consumer-level mass-manufactured pencils, but probably not enough to justify the current pricetag.",1503446400,2017-08-23

5.0,"CND is one of the best brand of gel shellac that I have used. It will cure using an LED light or a UV light. I have used both.  I have tried some of the less expensive brands, but they have caused nail damage, especially the ones that claim not to need a base coat. As long as I soak off the CND gel thoroughly with pure acetone, there have been no issues. Do not scrape residuals off. Let the acetone do the work. Make sure all layers are removed. If your nail looks shiny, the base coat has not been completely removed. Then soak longer. When applying the gel, be sure to apply one coat of the base, 2 coats of shellac, one top coat, and cure according to the directions between each coat. Be sure to seal the edges of each coat or you may get water between the coats and your nail, which may result in a nail fungus. If applied properly, it will last 2 weeks. I would not advise keeping it on longer than this due to the breakdown of the shellac, and nail exposure to water infiltration. Love this brand. Well worth the money.",1444953600,2015-10-16

5.0,"I have purposely not read the adjectives they used to describe this scent, in an effort to go in clean and describe just what I smell in this fragrance!

Words I'd use to describe Burberry Brit:
Sweet
Feminine (definitely feminine!)
Orange
Jasmine
Vanilla (just a hint, I actually don't care for vanilla scent, but it's a very light touch)
Floral -- maybe hyacinth, hibiscus, a hint of sweet rosewater
Light, not musky or spicy
A hint of Asian influences (I don't know what I mean by that, just that it has a touch of ""exotic"" undertones)
Reminds me slightly of a grown-up version of the scent ""Exclamation,"" a popular teen-oriented fragrance in the early 90's!  (But in a good way...this isn't a Walgreens scent like Love's Baby Soft or anything!)

This scent is absolutely impossible to stop smelling!  It is even nicer as time goes on -- an hour or two after applying it, it smells just heavenly.  SO feminine and refined, but not your grandmother's fragrance by any means.

It plays well with others -- it has a distinctively beautiful scent, but will mingle nicely with other unintended scents vying for attention (such as my mango shampoo) -- it just seems to blend nicely with other scents, and with your body's natural scent.

It lasts a good long time -- I hate it when you can't smell your perfume an hour later!  It's not overpowering, but it can easily become a ""signature scent"" that people associate with you, because its sweet, pleasant scent will still be detectable several hours later.

I am really in love with this scent, and I have gotten so many positive comments on it, even from coworkers who usually hate perfumes!  It always seems to be the same reaction: closing their eyes and inhaling deeply.  I have done that myself so many times with this Burberry Brit that I was in danger of fainting once after inhaling the scent too deeply over and over.  :-)

Ahava offers a wide variety of skin care products, however, this is the first I have used personally. Like millions of others, men and women alike, I have been seeking that eternal fountain of youth in a bottle. (or tube, or bucket for that matter.) So, when I read the description I was eager to put my regiment on temporary hold and try this.

The UPS delivery man had barely sat the box down when I started opening it. Thank goodness it was easy to open - no unnecessary this or that to impede my progress. Being aware of the product cost, I was surprised it comes in a plastic container, designed to look glass. It is attractive, easy to read and easy to open. Touching a single finger to the cream, and rubbing it between my index and thumb, a chemical like scent is noticeable, it feels thicker than lotion, is milky, a bit greasy at first - after several swirls the cream itself had been absorbed, but there was a residue that was still tacky to the touch. When I applied it to my face - I went through my cleansing routine, to ensure I began with a clean palate to test this product. I applied in small sections, because of the tackiness left on my fingers earlier. It doesn't take much of this gel, a little goes a long way. That is a big plus when factoring cost. Once applied to my face the scent became more of a factor than I had first thought.

There are many factors with these kinds of products that are a matter of personal preference, no right or wrong, they simply bother some, and go unnoticed by others (which is why there is such a vast selection of products, to find something to suit you, because no one product will ever suit everyone)... the scent is one such issue. Personally, I do not like a chemical scent on my face. I would prefer a gender neutral, unscented product. After I applied the gel/cream there was a shininess that didn't go away. Put that together with the sticky residue - this could definitely not be used as part of my morning routine under makeup.

I was so excited about this product and had hoped it would be something I would continue to use - Unfortunately, this gel/cream is just not the right product for me. That said, there are a lot of Ahava products available - I would be willing to try something different in the future.",1444867200,2015-10-15

This product has been around for a long time.  Keeping a firm 100 percent good reputation for quality ingredients. Unlike many brands that often change ingredients.

Go's on smoothly blends easily and when left for a setting period of time, gives a beautiful coverage.  It is not thick.  I wanted to cover up some very very dark bruises on my arms. Bruises caused due to thin skin, that often form  from age and medicine.
Coverage that on close inspection stand up.

Another great pro is the ability to cover and the length of time it keeps covering.  Having coverage for 24 hours is what I am experiencing.

Being waterproof until soap is applied. Another outstanding feature.

The bruise formulas may fade blood bruising but for trips and activities outside of home .... this completely gives a coverage so you are not self conscious of deep dark bruises.

4.0,"My oldest daughter is pregnant and started getting stretch marks, so she wanted to try this to stop any more from developing. After having six kids, I wanted to see if the breast firming gel would work for me as gravity has done a number on my figure.

My daughter absolutely loves the stretch mark product. It goes on easy, no gross residue, and has a pleasant scent. It also stopped the development of additional stretch marks in their tracks and she seems to have experienced a lightening of the few she did develop before using this in addition to not developing any others.

To be totally honest the breast firming product, which is kind of like a gel (but with no residue) didn't do much for me but it seems to act as a very good moisturizer and also has a very pleasant scent. Perhaps if I had used this product in the set throughout all of my pregnancies I would have had better luck. As it is, I saw little to no improvement in the bust area and my daughter also came into my bathroom to use it daily and she couldn't tell a difference really either (although that may be because she doesn't need help in that area).

Overall, even if the breast product isn't a hit the stretch mark cream definitely is and is worth the price of the set itself. I've tried stretch mark creams during my pregnancies that cost much more but did much less than this product has done for my daughter. Definitely recommend if you're worried about keeping your skin in the best shape possible during pregnancy and postpartum. One of the few stretch mark creams out there that really works.",1491177600,2017-04-03

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

4.0,"I love the La Roche-Posay brand. I use their line of acne products with great success.

This broad spectrum 60 SPF sunscreen is very light and supposedly transforms into a ""water-like"" lotion.  It doesn't really, in my opinion. You still have to rub it in and it feels like a light lotion, not water. (By contrast, Estee Lauder once sold a Verite sunscreen that did indeed go on like water! Naturally, they discontinued it...)  I still like it, and it's better than most suncreens, but it wasn't what I was expecting.

Also, note that this is fragrance free but it does indeed smell! It smells like sunscreen. Non-comedogenic and suitable for acne-prone skin, which is a requirement for me.

5.0,"This review is for ""The Old Bill.""  On my nails, it's a light, shiny copper color (but muted compared to actual copper metal).

I didn't use a base coat and used a Seche Vite quick dry topcoat.

I was surprised to find that this polish was 5-free.  Usually 3- or 5-free polishes shrink a lot on my nails, especially at the edges.  But this one hasn't shrunk.  And at day 2, I don't have any chips yet.  (I'm hard on my hands and most polishes have chipped at least a little by now.)

I'm definitely a fan of this polish.  The performance has been so good that I'd even consider buying more colors from the same brand -- even though this is expensive, as nail polishes go.",1410048000,2014-09-07

5.0,"Works for sun spots on my arms, chest, upper back and calves (yes, ladies, if you wear shorts or knee length skirts in summer you probably get sun spots in that area). I used other Nia 24 products on my face and neck and they improved my skin texture a lot. Once it happened I became unhappy with the texture on other areas on my body. I saw other women who made the same mistake: they neglected the skin on their bodies and because of that their smooth faces didn't make them look younger.
I started using the cream during cooler months when the areas I applied the cream to were covered by clothing and thus protected from UV. I was patient. It took several months for the sun damaged skin of my arms, upper back, hands and calves to start improving.
I recommended the cream to others and can say that the only people who were not happy with it either did not give it enough time or used it in summer and during the day did nothing (sunscreen, clothing, shade) to protect their skin from UV light. I wonder if the people who gave the cream
negative reviews made the same mistake. How can you expect to reverse sun damage if you continue to expose your skin to UV?

It just seems neater and more distinct. I like the colors more than I thought I would. The pencil goes on easily, and is easy to blend. I love having the 2 colors. I had fun applying it with a young friend. The pencil is easy to sharpen, and doesn't crumble, break, etc. when sharpened.

My one reservation about this product is that when my lips were slightly chapped from windy conditions, the pencil seemed to irritate them. When my lips healed, this was no longer a problem.

Recommended, though others want to go easy on this  product when lips are unhappy.",1485216000,2017-01-24

As someone who struggled with cystic acne for a long time I very much appreciate something that helps keep my skin clean and that gives me the added bonus of making cleaning feel a bit more indulgent and spa-like.

Over the years, I've figured out which brushes I like the most and Sensitive is one of my go to brushes (though I also really like Acne and Cashmere).  I like it because it cleanses my skin without stripping it of moisture and feels really nice on the skin like a spa treatment.  Because Sensitive is my go-to brush head this set is great because it is more economical to get one or two.  That said if you're just starting out and trying to decide what works best for you I recommend one of the variety sets that has 4 types of brushes vs. one.  Those are great so you can find the brush (or combination of brushes) that best suits your needs.

Right now I have oily combination skin, but mostly oily on T zone and cheeks. I decided to get the Regimen Kit by this company, and in it is a sample of this product.

I cleaned my face and used the toner, then tried this item. I LOVED it instantly. It goes on so smoothly and easily. You only need a tiny bit, even my sample will last a week or two with how little I need to use. It sinks in my skin and leaves me with a nice velvety finish.

The next morning I woke up to smooth skin! NO OIL! I was so blown away. I went and purchased the normal size. It's pricy, I never usually spend more than $7 on a product so this is new to me.

The difference between the $20 brand and the $100 brand can be subtle. All that said, this is a high quality product. It absorbs well and doesn't leave an oil slick on your face. The scent is nothing to write home about, but it's subtle and dissipates fairly rapidly. Although I like the way my skin feels after using this, I can't say I see any noticeable difference. Your experience might be different.

3.0,"All right, this is going to be a weird review. I should have gotten the Julep Feels Like Velvet Eye Full-Coverage Eye shadow in Coconut and Cabanas. What I got was their pore reducing blush in petal pink. So yeah, I'm reviewing the wrong product, but I'm going with the link they sent me....

I'll say this, VERY nice packaging. You got a solid plastic case that closes well (so if you want to carry this in your purse, bag or for traveling) and it includes a mirror. The powder is very finely milled as well, and a little goes a long way. Great pigmentation, it's a very bright pink (and I'm pale), but it goes on sheer so you're not looking like a clown, it works well with buildability. Don't know about the pore thing, my pores are just fine, but it lays on top of the skin so no irritation. Judging from how well the blush is made, I'd say that the eye shadow is probably really good as well, with just as good packaging.

So, I'd hope that you don't get screwed with the product mix-up that I did. If I'd ordered and received the right product, I'd give this more stars, but....",1467590400,2016-07-04

4.0,I have dry skin and am constantly trying to find moisturizers that will not clog my pores and keep me hydrated.  I like the scent of this oil and so far it does not appear to clog my skin but sometimes I find it a little heavy.  It could be because it is still summer and not the winter when I feel especially dry that I found myself using this sparingly or not at all.  I think this facial oil is probably too heavy if you have oily skin or if the weather is hot and humid.  It is probably a great protector if you live in an arid environment or if it is winter.  It does seem to smooth the skin out but because it is an oil  you may want to let it absorb a bit (or not using it) before applying top layers of makeup as they may come off.

4.0,"A simple 3 step ""facial' that cool, cleans and refreshens.

Not much in the box, 2 treatments, starting with a small bottle of ""mask' that one applies after wetting down the face.  It has a nice smell, slightly fruity, that you rinse off after 5 minutes.  Step 2, open the little peel pack, a moist pad, that one wipes over the face and allows to dry.  The skin feels clean, dry and slightly tight; moreover, if you have any nicks or scratches on your face, you'll sense a slight sting.  Step 3 is a moisturizing cream with vitamin c that one massages on face and neck- again, a pleasant, mildly fruity smell.

It wasn't instant for me, as I did have to wipe several times with a little bit of scrubbing to get it all off. That's probably to be expected with all similar products and may vary with your brand of mascara.

You must shake it well, because it quickly separates into blue and white liquids. It feels just like oil and water going on. There doesn't appear to be any oil in the mixture, but it does contain a lot of chemicals that are used as emollients in cosmetics. It also contains solvents to help break down the mascara to remove it. I normally use micellar water to remove regular (non-waterproof) mascara, but that doesn't do a good job on waterproof mascara.

4.0,"Powerful and priced right, I purchased this hair dryer to replace an aging Conair 1800 watt dryer.  I was impressed with the numerous positive reviews for this product, so I thought I'd give it a try.

My first impression, as was the case for many reviewers, is how much heavier this dryer is than others I've used.  Its 9' power cord is substantial and the Professional Super Turbo 2800 (as it is named on the box...) is hefty , but not oversized.  The grip is comfortable, so the added weight doesn't seem that noticeable to me.

The selling points to this dryer are the following:

+ 2000 watts
+ 'Ionic' - negative ions eliminate static, and reduce drying time.
+ 'Ceramic' - emits the negative ions and generates far-infrared heat, which is less harmful to your hair.
+ (6) heat/speed setting combinations; cool to hot, all work well.
+ Extended life AC motor with limited 3-Year Warranty from time of purchase (with receipt) or time it was manufactured without a receipt, per the included instruction/styling guide.
+ Cold shot button.
+ Removable, easy to clean rear filter; twist and remove.
+ Concentrator nozzle - removable.

Unlike many of the reviewers, I noted no 5-10 minute improvement in terms of shortened drying time of my thick, wavy, medium length hair.  I also noted no great change in the texture of my hair after using this product.

I found this hand cream via a friend a few years ago, and I have not been without it since that time. I wash my hands frequently and need to moisturize my hands often. This small tube lasts a long time because you need very little amount each time. That little amount you use will moisturize your hands so well that you can go through few hand washings and the cream stays on. I cannot say enough about the quality of this hand cream.

While I agree that it has its own unique (and not too overpowering) scent it's hard to pin down exactly what it smells like. The scent is described as ""rose, raspberry and coconut"" but I swear I smelled vanilla. Also, I definitely smell flowers, but I don't really pick up on any raspberry.

It was a bit smaller then I anticipated, but given how far a little bit goes - I would not consider this a problem.

The Jouer tint + matte bronzer have become two of my daily go-to's for a natural, easy look - I have a feeling this may be my new favorite line.

Highly recommend!",1401580800,2014-06-01
2.0,I don't understand such a pretty color.  Every now and then some of CND Shellac colors will wrinkle on me even if o put very thin coats.  This bicycle yellow did that and now I do not use it.,1439942400,2015-08-19
4.0,"This filler does work around fine lines.  It softens wrinkles around the eyes and upper lip.  It does not, however, eradicate deep lines over foreheads.  Half a pump press is enough to cover forehead, eyes and mouth area. Using it twice a day for at least a week shows some softness around the eyes.

The effects last most of the day.  The skin feels slightly tightened and moisturized.",1524355200,2018-04-22

5.0,"Great long lasting color and shine!  This particular color requires 3 coats for full coverage.  Also, it is a little more difficult to remove than other colors.  Still, best nail polish ever.  Manicure - full set and dry - in just 30 minutes.",1394755200,2014-03-14
3.0,"I don't like the tall bottle, which is easy to tip over while applying the polish.  It dries quickly.  Unfortunately, the polish chips easily, so you may want to use a good base coat (like China Glaze) first, then this polish, then a quality top coat (like Seche Vite).  Without the base coat and top coat, the Julep polish lasted less than a day on my nails.  After reapplying, this time with the base coat and top coat, it lasted a week before it started chipping.

Another thing I didn't like is the color.  On my monitor, the color (Alaina) looked like a lovely lavender.  On my nails, it's lavender mixed with gray.  Maybe if I were younger...  My husband called the color horrid.  I don't like the color any more than he does.  It might look pretty if you stamp your nails with a dark color over the Alaina.  By itself, not so much.",1469145600,2016-07-22
4.0,"Given the fact that I really dislike most colognes and have made out house nearly fragrance free - the 4 starts I give this says a lot.  My husband wanted some sort of scent for special occasions...so I read the description of this one and thought it was worth a try.  I liked the idea of a smell that ""featur(ed) notes of citrus, spicy saffron, creamy tonka, sweet vanilla, exotic fruit, fine wine, powdery musk, warm woods.""  (Although I have no idea what tonka is.)

Because of my lack of scent tolerance, he tried it first by spraying just a bit on a piece of paper towel.  I sniffed it carefully...and liked it.  I picked up the vanilla, the wine and the warm woods smells.  Upon repeated sniffs, I still liked it.

BUT.  To say that a little of this goes a long way is a huge understatement.  While spraying this onto the paper towel, my husband got just a drop on his thumb...and that lingered for hours.  You could also smell it throughout the room.  Hence the 4/5 starts.

I told him he should wear it...but not too often and using the smallest amount he could.  I like this...but I think it could be overpowering with even a conservative amount applied.",1474502400,2016-09-22

3.0,"Just did my nails two days ago and I now have a big chip in the middle of my index finger.  This polish isn't very durable at all.  It's not even as sturdy as Essie polishes.  This is a beautiful sea green color that I thought would be perfect for spring/summer.  It goes on a little dark, but is still pretty.  It's too bad it doesn't stand up to even the slightest wear.  It went on a little streaky, but once the second coat was on, it was fine.  This is the first Zoya polish I've tried.  Before now, I haven't been impressed by the color selection, but this nice green color spoke to me when I was in Ulta (and there was a sale to boot, lol!).  I don't like having chips and usually do my polish as soon as they start to appear.  But I definitely don't like it when I've babied my manicure and a huge gouge appears in the middle of my nail!  Not cool at all.  I haven't used one of the 5 free formulas before and so far, I don't like it at all.  Give me the chemicals that make nail polish last a week please!  I guess I'll go repair my chipped nail now, and hopefully that'll be it for a while.  I recommend this polish only if you're sensitive to the chemicals in nail polish.  Otherwise, try Whim, Butter London, Dior or even Essie.  All of which last longer than this Zoya polish.",1431734400,2015-05-16

This wouldn't be that big of a deal if the price were lower, but given the current price point, this pen is outrageously tiny.  Great concealer but not nearly enough product for the price!",1487462400,2017-02-19
4.0,"Definitely a full coverage stick. Long lasting, even on a sweaty hot day. Only negative is that it's a little drying to the skin. Otherwise I like it and think it's at a great price point for the quality.",1499299200,2017-07-06
4.0,"I always make it clear that it is nearly impossible to verify benefits for anti-aging and various benefits in a short time frame.  So you have to rely on the list of ingredients as a guide and your own experience with a product. But as the list of ingredients lengthens and the print gets smaller and smaller it seems like it could be a full time job keeping up.

And this packaging doesn't make it any easier.  The print is virtually impossible to read and is condensed so tightly that it looks like a legal disclaimer.  Then combined with multiple languages on the same panel you'll need a Six Million Dollar Man eye to read it.
The jar itself is very attractive and is inline with a product of this price.

However, I will say that right away I liked this because it was thick on my hands but smoothed on and absorbed very easily by my skin.  It didn't feel heavy at all and wasn't an issue when I went out in the humid summer air.

It feels good and my face likes the effect.

Now as to its claims.  The primary claims is that it will help you look better deeper into the day.  I cant really vouch for that as I haven't noticed any differences later in the day.  But hadn't really been looking for them before using this.
I notice that it does not contain any Retinol which has been proven to reduce wrinkles and is commonly found in anti-aging blends.  So I am a little surprised I don't see it here.

Overall I am happy with the product and results (so far) but will likely go back to a preferred brand that contains Retinol A and that I have had success with in the past.

But that is just a personal preference. Aside from the packaging and the lack of Retinol I don't have any issues with recommending this as a daily moisturizer.",1449360000,2015-12-06

3.0,"My teenage daughter definitely likes these - they're easy to use. There is that bit of oily residue as mentioned by other reviewers but all one has to do is towel off after as my daughter does. However, that's an issue as it seems like the product could be/should be less likely to leave residue since it's purpose is to repair. The rest of the makeup needs to remain unaffected and the area itself shouldn't have to be prepped for a redo. Otherwise, a tiny bit of remover on an ordinary Q tip would suffice. There are no instructions as to how to replace the wand though the kit comes with extras. That's odd. Between my daughter's appreciation of it and my doubts I'm going to give it a 3. It's far from perfect or necessary.",1394755200,2014-03-14

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

It's smooth and seems to absorb pretty well. I only used it twice, though, because of the resulting allergic reaction. I did want to add that I have terrible allergies and that many strong scents give me headaches so I'm more sensitive than most but, if you have this type of reaction, just be aware of a stronger-than-normal scent to this product.",1416787200,2014-11-24

It goes on evenly and stays throughout the day on the face. I don't know how well it would wear on other areas if one were to sweat.

The tube is handy to toss in your purse or leave on the bathroom countertop. It looks like a thin lipstick tube although a little longer. The product comes out of the tube the same way a lipstick comes out - by turning the bottom until you have a small amount out. It's easy to apply either directly or by applying with clean fingers.

This is a good concealer. It does very well at hiding dark circles as well as skin that's slightly pigmented, or dark spots.

5.0,"As much as I hate when people use the word delicious to describe anything but foodthis scrub is delicious. I subscribed to an embarrassing number of beauty boxes for a couple of years, so Ive tried all manner of fancy, expensive body products, and Im usually underwhelmed. Scrubs in particular seldom impress, because they're so easy to make it home (salt or sugar base, oils, plus other additives like oatmeal etc.), but this one is amazing. Its so luxurios feeling and smelling, the experience is true decadence. The balance between the scrub and the oily vehicle is perfect, and it doesnt have that utilitarian feel of homemade and most commercial scrubs (Im not describing this well, but the bottom line is that it doesnt perform like something I could make myself with ingredients in my pantry and bathroom).

Though its a salt scrub, it didn't irritate the many scrapes and scratches on my legs, unusual for a salt scrub (and why I lean toward sugar scrubs). It left my skin soft and hydrated, but didn't leave me greasy or leave behind a slick coating in my shower.

But the really unique part of this scrub is the scent. Generally speaking, I wish every single product I use was unscented instead of scented the way it is. Rituals brand is one of the few consistent exceptions. Ive tried many of their scents through beauty boxes, and they're all very different and all very good. This one is rich and exotic but not overwhelming or cloying, just decadent.

Just as a sidenote, I hate all that marketing nonsese about purifying sea salt and this scrub purifying body and soul. Huh? My souls is pure now? Thats a neat trick. _ But its definitely a bath treat lavish enough to qualify as a little bit of sensory self-care.

Finally, this scrub stands up on its own. Not one to engage in multi-step beauty rituals if any kind (who has that kind of time or cash?), I don't preceed/follow this with the recommended 3 additional products, and I am perfectly delighted. I simply shower as usual, then use the scrub and rinse afterwards, no additional wash or moisturizer necessary.

2.0,"I received this in exchange for my honest review.  In order to assess the value of a review for your own personal buying decision, I think it's important to understand the preferences of the reviewer.  I adore scent.  I favor somewhat pungent natural fragrances with strong notes of rose, cumin, amber, but also some soliflores.  My own personal fragrances tend to come from places like Andy Tauer (Une Rose Chypree), LeLabo (Rose31) and Annick Goutal (Rose Absolue, Eau de Charlotte).  Formy husband I like Serge Lutens Chergui.  So, if you do not share my tastes, what I have to say about Burberry Brit will not be relevant to you.

I found this to be a  generic modern chemical ozonic  rather sweet fragrance, not very easily distinguishable from many that you can sample at Sephora.  To my nose it has more in common with the scent of dryer sheets than the kind of fragrance I am drawn to.  Very little silage, but it is quite long lasting on the skin.  Fragrance is a very personal thing.  For me personally it is not a match.  Neither on me nor my husband.  Your mileage may vary, as they say.",1445385600,2015-10-21
2.0,"This bronzer is two things: it's too dark for my light complexion and it's as orange as it can be.  I can't figure out why it has so many positive reviews.  It goes on smoothly and looks fine for the first hour, then it oxidizes and turns pumpkin orange.  The last thing I want is to look like an oompha-loompha, lol!  I bought it in San Francisco and at the time I swatched it, it didn't appear orange at all.  In fact, it was a nice bronze color that appeared perfectly matte (which it is despite the color shift) and would have been perfect.  My skin is not oily but is normal, so I can't blame the oxidation on oil.  I also use a mattifying primer under my foundation, so it shouldn't have been an issue at all.  When first applied, this bronzer looks quite nice and gave me a nice nude, sunkissed look.  However, an hour later, I was struck by the color shift and I saw that I had orangey brown areas all over my face.  If you want a decent bronzer, either keep looking or try Hoola by Benefit.  Hoola doesn't change color and will give you the nice tan color you're looking for in order to achieve a nude or sculpted look.

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20
4.0,"This does not work for me to set makeup at all. It does give me a dewy, shiny look but it does not have the same fixing effect as my MAC or NYX products. It feels more like a rosewater solution that is nice over a powder foundation on dry skin. For already oily skin it may make it too shiny looking unless a matte product is used as makeup.

I do love the fragrance and the cooling feel of the mist. I think I will end up using it more during the winter than summer, or maybe even after a harsh, hot and drying day in the sun. It's a great product, it's just not very useful for me as a make-up fixing spray.",1465171200,2016-06-06
5.0,"As a lipstick addict, with dozens of lipsticks, I feel as if I know what I want in one.  This one is moist and dewy yet has amazing longevity on my lips and lasts even through a meal.  It imparts a slight stain of color which stays on for hours.  Usually when a lipstick is this long lasting it has a slightly dry feel on the lips and is one I avoid for that reason.  This feels moist and smooths out my lips instead of drying them, so I feel it is worth the high price for this since it accomplishes longevity while staying moist.

This is similar to Yves St Laurent lipsticks with the same extremely high pigmentation and staying power.  It is actually superior to that brand because of the non drying formula.  This covers up all pigmentation on my lips with a semi matte appearance.

There isn't a lot of glossiness with this which can be good or bad depending on what you prefer.  The pigment is saturated.  I have dark lips that this completely covers and that also is something I love about this. The tube/case itself is nice but not special.  And this color is a beautiful deep reddish mauve color which works well on my skin, even though I am pale.  I feel that $20 is a high price for a lipstick so it needs to be special, and this deserves the high price.  The assortment of colors is also perfect.  I now want to get shades 1, 3, 5 and 11.  All the shades look gorgeous.",1420243200,2015-01-03

5.0,"I have tried several brands of serum and this one by far is my favorite. This smaller travel size is fantastic and it doesnt leak like so many of them do. The product itself smells great; it has an understated herbal sweetness to it. This to me is nicer and more appealing than the usual clear dimethicone/dimethocol serums.

I usually apply three pumps to my palms to run through my thick, coarse shoulder length hair then blow dry. It smooths my hair without weighing it down, and makes it noticeably softer. I follow with the Davines No 4 putty to create detail after I blow dry and my hair looks and feels good all day. I liked this one so much I bought two.",1348272000,2012-09-22

4.0,"I got this fragrance for my wife and found it decent but unexciting.  I think it smells a lot like soap.  Not deodorant soap mind you, but one of those fancy little soaps you aren't supposed to use or the wife gets mad at you.  It is fruity and flowery with just a hint of baby powder.  Certainly not offensive, but also not particularly sensual or romantic, at least not for me.  Other reviewers have said it is good for summer; I can understand that but think it would be just fine any time.  I would say it is medium-body, certainly not heavy and maybe a little on the lighter side.

It's half-life is about 4 hours or so; in other words, I can still smell it on her after a full day, but it's only about 1/4th as strong.

I would say it tends older, i.e. 30s and up.  My teen daughter characterized it as ""musty flowers"" and while she thought it was okay, it wasn't something she found special or would wear regularly.

Overall I would say this is a good, basic scent that is just fine but nothing special or head-turning.  If that's what you want, it could be perfect for you.  If you want something a little spicy or musky or daring, this is probably not the one.",1425859200,2015-03-09
4.0,"I've been using the MEG 21 Cell Therapy Anti-Oxidant Boost Serum for just a few days and will update after 3 weeks (to address their claim).
I am also experimenting on the back of one hand to have a more accurate comparison.

I have extremely sensitive skin that is very dry.  Being post-menopausal, I lost what little moisture I had--plus I live in a drought area with extremely low (or nil) humidity.  I am scent sensitive as well.  The skin on my face is soaks up moisture (as if it is starving...which it may be)

Out of the gate, the scent of this product is faint and borderline for my sensitivity.  The initial scent strength fades quickly, but does remain in my acceptable range.  The ""scent flavor"" is of the perfumy type (very light) vs. citrus or medicinal.

What I like A LOT is that this Serum spreads smoothly, dries quickly, and leaves a silky sheen without appearing (or feeling) oily/greasy.  High fives here.  I appreciate my skin feeling and appearing hydrating without a greasy covering.  30 minutes after applying both (as of this writing), my face and the back of my right hand feel slightly cooler to the touch with a lovely pleasurable soft feel.  Both FEEL moisturized--which is a plus.

I have LOTS of fine (and not-so-fine) lines on my face with its 64 years mostly due to starting with dry skin (+ age-related moisture-loss & residence weather).  I have no fantasies of losing all the lines, but am interested in giving my facial skin the help and health I can.

Other reviewers (and the description on amazon) do a complete job in the science and trials-info -- so I will not repeat here.

The bottle is small (1 oz)--under 5"" high--very nicely packaged.  Simple, elegant.  The opening inner cap is a new & interesting design...twist one way and the inner-pump dispenser lifts up; twist the opposite and the dispenser retreats back into the silver outer cap (handy for travel & evaporation prevention)  Nice, light, and easy to hold and operate.

Recommended to be applied twice each day onto clean skin.  (the follow-up moisturizer is also suggested, but I have only the Serum to review)

Of course, what shoppers want to know... Does it work as advertised, is it worth the price (current on amazon: $95), and how long does it last?
I am sorry to make you wait... but, I'll be back in mid-to-late September to update.",1472256000,2016-08-27

4.0,"If you have fine hair, you know that even a professional layered cut can only help so much with giving your hair lift and body. For every inch of length below your shoulders, you're looking at extra time with product, a ventilated brush, and a blow dryer.

Ive never really been able to master that technique, and often find myself getting frustrated and pulling my hair back into a ponytail or French braid on hectic mornings. Every so often, I think about how much more body my hair has when its short, but I just don't want to give up the length.

Thats why I was so curious to try the Stylus. While watching videos showing the wand in use, I was reminded of those hybrid curling irons that had brush-type spikes that were popular but never really made my hair look good. But with this brush's wider, more oval shape, people using the Stylus were able to produce larger, more natural waves rather than the ringlets I remembered.

My major concerns were whether I would be able to get acceptable results on my own, how long they would last, and how much heat exposure my hair would have to take. The short answer is that after faithful practice, I am able to add volume and a gentle body wave to my hair, and that the wave lasts all day. With a tighter twist, I have been able to set curves at the ends that linger into the next day  with little or no  product!

The following information is really detailed, but this tool is a pretty big investment. I have tried to think of questions you might have, and to answer them and the questions I had before receiving the Stylus and while I was teaching myself how to use it.

TEMPERATURE: The Stylus has five heat settings, ranging from 250 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. You choose what temperature to use based on how thick your strands of hair are and whether they're straight, wavy or curly. I practiced with 250 degrees but now that I am comfortable with the brush, I use the 285-degree setting. The temperature indicators are easy to read, and the wand heats up in less than 2 minutes. It seems to maintain a steady temperature during use. I unplug it when Im done, but it does have a one-hour auto-shutoff (I timed the unit several times, and it shut off reliably).

USAGE and TECHNIQUE: The styling brush comes with a small information booklet that includes instructions for building volume, making flips and waves, and smoothing your hair. While the steps are clearly explained, I found FHIs brief videos to be much more helpful, because I could see how to hold the brush, slowly pull it through a section of hair, and be sure to maintain enough tension on the section of hair. While my first couple of tries didn't look like the video results, I now can get similar body and wave.

Working with longer hair, the most challenging parts of using this brush are keeping the section of hair you are styling seated in the center of the bristles, and making sure that the hair wraps around the brush and into the grooves of the back without doubling up on itself when you pull the wand away from your scalp.

HAIR CARE: As mentioned, my hair stays fuller all day. I am not a fan of heavy leave-in product, but do apply a scant amount of Its a 10 leave-in mist with keratin after I am done with the Stylus. Note that the product packaging warns you to use this brush only on dry hair.  I have not had any issues with drying, brittleness, breakage or split ends, but my hair is not processed or treated.

The longest sections of my hair reach the middle of my back (almost 18 inches from crown to ends), so I had to practice for about a week before I got dependable results. But I am now able to work through sections of my hair and add volume near my scalp and gentle waves down the length of my hair pretty quickly. The key is to go slowly and keep steady tension on the section of hair you're working with  and then to give it a quick molding with your palm and leave it alone until it has fully cooled.

THE BRUSH. The Stylus itself is easy to hold.  You use the power button to turn it on and to choose the heat setting you want. The handle is rounded and has a grippy matte finish, so its easy to control. The swivel mount for the cord at the base of the handle is easy to keep away from your arm and hair. The electrical cord itself is thick and yet flexible, so it doesnt hang you up while you are working.

The brush area is 4 inches long by about 1-3/4 inches wide by about 1-1/2 inches thick. The base is roughly oval, rather than cylindrical. I found this a lot easier to work with than either my round heat brush or my memories of my old heated brush wand. The flexible part of the cord is about 8-1/2 feet long, not counting the reinforced swivel base or the plug.

STORAGE: The Stylus comes with a heat-resistant pouch. The main section is long enough to hold the brush, and has a fold-over lid that has a Velcro-type fastener. An outer pocket holds the coiled electrical cord, which has its own Velcro-type keeper loop that you wrap around the bundled cord.

VALUE: This unit is about the price of a midrange blow dryer, a styling brush, and either a midrange flatiron or curling iron combined. So while you cannot use it to dry your hair, it can be used to provide a similar variety of styles as those other tools. As noted, with practice I found it easier to use than those other tools, and got longer-lasting results, so I rate it as providing a similar value if you add up the prices of those other tools.

However, I am docking a star for the steep cost to customers who need to use the one-year warranty. That fee is currently about one-third the price of the unit, and covers handling and return postage (you also have to pay shipping and any tracking or insurance to send off the unit, and must call a toll-free line to request a return-authorization number).",1458345600,2016-03-19

5.0,"I received the fair/light shade of this Effaclar BB Blur.  I have never used this brand much less heard of it.  I have used many BB and CC creams, but this BB Blur excels all the other products by far.  It goes on smooth and creamy.  The coverage is wonderful and it looks very natural.  The color for me was perfect as I am fair skinned and I particularly liked the way it covers but doesn't look heavy.  I also didn't have any problems with breakouts like I sometimes do whenever I use a new foundation.  I have been using Almay Smart Shade and liked it pretty well, but this BB Blur outperforms it by a mile.  I guess, if I can afford this slightly more expensive BB foundation, I will definitely try to keep this one.  I was very impressed with the look, texture, and coverage of this product.

4.0,"I have to admit that I had more and more trepidation as we got closer to trying this on me. And then even more as I could see the flashes through my hands over closed eyes. But there was no burning or noticeable reaction of any kind.

For me, I am targeting some rather thick back hair that my partner would also like to see gone, or at least controlled. This gives one small problem because I cannot reach the area by myself. So it has been a team effort. She aka been wearing the protective goggles and patiently applying the device.

As for results, it is mixed, for one I needed to shave the hair off per instructions so it is hard to truly tell how much thinner it is, but there does seem to be less after three weeks. So we have quite a ways to go. At this point I am happy that no damage appears to be done.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19

I was fighting my own DNA. I figured that since it is an IS CLINICAL product that it would be a good quality product that I would have success with. One pump was all it took and it was more than enough to be able to dab under both eyes. It went on smoothly and had no greasy feel. There was no sensitivity as a result of using this product.

It has been close to two months now that I have been applying this for a month; I have not seen any results. Perhaps, it takes more time to see results but I do not want to go through half the bottle to find out that it needs more time. I was fortunate enough to get this item free to try and review but any other person might not be thrilled to try this expensive product to find out that it doesn't work.

4.0,"At first when I put this on my daughter I hated it, but once it was on, I couldn't stop sniffing her! It's a light smell but the lotion is very runny. It's runnier than the previous 2 brands I've purchased for her.

I'd purchase this mainly because I love how she smells.",1403568000,2014-06-24

5.0,"I'm using this set with my Mia fit clarisonic. The radiance has been my go to everyday brush for awhile but it's nice to try out some different ones. The sensitive is a new favorite, it cleans deeply without being too rough on my skin. The cashmere brush is unique. I wasn't sure how well it would work since it's so very soft but I'm pleasently surprised by it. It certainly doesn't exfoliate or deep clean but it's wonderfully gentle for days when my skin is broken out or just extra sensitive and I want to use my clarisonic but I don't want anything too harsh. The deep pore brush is ok but I'm saving it for occasional use. It's just a bit too rough for my skin but my skin is on the sensitive side so I'm not surprised by that. It does work great on my husbands skin. It even clears out blackheads although it does leave his skin red so it's not something he would use frequently.",1504051200,2017-08-30
5.0,"High-number protection sunscreen is a necessity here, pretty much all year round.  We thus go through a lot of it, and have several varieties.

This is a welcome addition to our sunscreen shelf, and much more pleasant to use than the Neutrogena sunscreen that I have been using.  It is not greasy or unbearably pungent.  And it does good things to the summer/gardening roughened skin on my arms, and is thus better as a skin lotion than the Neutrogena sunscreen.",1444867200,2015-10-15
4.0,"Synthetic brushes are generally best for liquid/cream makeup because they don't absorb the makeup and natural brushes generally work best for dry makeup powders/blush/etc.  This buffing brush is synthetic.

Put your liquid foundation on top of the brush & gently blend in to the skin in a circular pattern.  Less is more - don't put on too much.  You can always add more later.  This brush did a good job of applying foundation evenly - it takes practice to get this right.

Besides being a beautiful brush, the handle is comfortable & easy to hold with control.  However, I prefer a hard, easy-to- clean handle.  I think this handle will fall apart over time & may even collect grunge.

A few bristles came out the first time I washed it but nothing dramatic.  The second time, no bristles came out.  It is not unusual to lose a few bristles but if they fall out every time, you eventually have a bald & useless brush.

Keep your brushes clean!  For dry-use brushes, wash them at least once a week.  For brushes you are using with wet/foundation/cream you really should wash after each use - at least a rinse under warm water.  I wash all brushes with a gentle shampoo but any unscented soap will work.  I rinse them well with warm water & let them air dry.  Not only does this help your brushes last longer & stay soft but it is really important to wash out the bacteria/dead skin/oils/makeup that build up quickly on makeup brushes - YUCK.  If you don't take care of them, you can get rashes, breakouts, etc. & your makeup will be a mess.",1458086400,2016-03-16
4.0,I really like the iluminage Skin Pillow.  I have not noticed any difference in my skin but I have only been using it for a few weeks - I have noticed less hair breakage in the shower in the morning though - probably because my hair glides over the pillow.  The pillow itself is beautiful and really goes well with my existing decor and looks like an accent pillow propped on my bed.  I have not washed it yet - but it seems like it is good quality and will hold up.  I will update my review after a few months of use.,1470700800,2016-08-09
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20

I does seem to have tightened/filled in the lines under my eyes a small amount, but nothing super noticeable.

4.0,"I have used Baxter of California products for years and have always liked them.  This Shave Duo kit was something new to me, so I was anxious to give it a try.  The products in this kit are a pre- and post-shave tonic spray and an aftershave gel balm.  They are 4 oz. each in size, but small amounts go a long way, and they both should last a long time even with regular usage.

The tonic spray can be used both before and after shaving.  Since the balm is used after shaving I use the tonic spray only prior to my shave.  It is supposed to help open pores and condition the skin for a more comfortable shave. The instructions say it should be applied with a hot towel, but that it can be alternatively sprayed directly on your face.  Messing with a hot towel is more work than I want to put into shaving, so I simply spray it on my face.  You do have to exercise extra care that you don't get spray in your eyes.  The tonic has a nice scent, and I let it sit on my face for a minute or so before brushing on some Pre de Provence shaving soap.  Using a double-edge razor with a Derby blade I find that I get a much closer shave using the tonic that I get without it.  The razor seemed to glide over my face more smoothly.  I have had no facial irritation, although I usually don't get much irritation from shaving with the products I already use.

After shaving I use the balm and find it makes my face feel quite good.  A very small dime-sized dab of balm is all that is needed.  It has a very light citrus scent to it that should not interfere with any other aftershave or cologne one might use.

Like all Baxter of California products, this kit is expensive.  It seems like Baxter of California prices most everything they sell in the $30 price range.  But they are nice products and generally last quite a while.  The shave tonic in this kit does seem to make for a smoother shave, and the aftershave balm is soothing as advertised.  This kit would be ideal for anyone who tends to experience irritation from shaving.  Those who shave with either a single or double edged razor should find this a worthwhile complement to their shaving routine.",1468454400,2016-07-14
5.0,"This EDP spray by the fashion house of Juicy Couture Is extremely pretty in appearance, and it smells completely delicious! My first impression is of honeydew melon and of honeysuckle. These top notes quickly dry down into the scent of tuberose and lily, two ""white flowers"" which are often used in perfumes. I barely smell the base notes of caramel and brown sugar, however the scent is very long lasting and wonderful for fruit (the honeydew does linger) and flower lovers. I would say if you particularly love tuberose, go for this! Also if you like really stunning eau de perfum bottles (which I do), try this offering from Juicy Couture. The bottle is very heavy, and the cut glass top is a total wow. The little charms, attached at the bottle's wrapped neck by a quaint silver tone safety pin, are of an imperial crown in faux ivory and a silvery ""J"" for Juicy. The label has the couture house scottie crest in silver on the front and the box is--what else? Pink! It's Juicy Couture. Makes a super gift for the perfume lover in your life, or for yourself. I love this: it really does have the juice!",1457654400,2016-03-11

The colors work well with my skin tone and the size is perfect for putting in my desk or weekend bag.  It does need a good brush kit to pair with but it goes one easily and smoothly and blends nicely.  There is some shimmer which isn't typically my thing but this is just the right amount to make my skin glow without going too far.  The gold pen is a really nice touch with the colors and adds a nice dimension to the clutch.,1468972800,2016-07-20

2.0,"The interesting thing about this product is that so many of its pros also wind up being cons.

For example: the texture of the cream is very light - some have called it almost gel-like, and I'd agree with that.  That lightness makes it easy to smooth on the face.  The downside to that: it's so light that it doesn't impart much moisture at all.  This would be great for someone who doesn't have particularly dry skin, but for those of us who need a big dose of moisture, this doesn't work for that.  For those who benefit from light moisturization, be prepared for how this product gives you that: in my experience, after it's smoothed on, it leaves a lightly tacky, even greasy feel to the skin.

The scent has gotten a lot of mentions in reviews, and there is a reason for that.  I thought it would be fine for me even though I'm very sensitive to strong aromas because ""parfum/fragrance"" is the last item on the ingredient list.  Initially, it seems to have a lovely, light rose scent.  However, that scent doesn't dissipate at all - it just sits there on your face, and for me, it became cloying and eventually overwhelming.  By the time I'd had it on for about a half hour, I'd begun to develop a headache and had to wash it off.  (Side note: it didn't come off easily at all with just water; this is the kind of product that requires some kind of cleanser to totally remove.)

The packaging is nice, in terms of the inside of the box having diagrams and instructions for application of the product, and the jar is quite pretty with a useful mirror serving as the top of the lid.  The downside here, though, is that this obviously requires you to dip your fingers into the product in order to then apply it to your face; as such, even with clean hands, eventually bacteria could start to be a concern, so I would have preferred if the cream had come in a pump-form.

The aspects of the product that don't have ""cons"" - it's paraben free, and even though my skin is highly sensitive, I didn't experience any irritation when I put this on my face.  (However, it is worth noting again that I could only tolerate having it on my skin for a half hour because of the fragrance.)

It's been so difficult - actually it's been impossible, thus far - for me to find a moisturizer/cream that won't irritate my sensitive skin and won't make my extreme sensitivity to fragrance come into play.  This product will likely work for people who don't have to deal with those things and don't require a product that delivers a lot of moisture.  For all of those like me who are on a quest for an effective, non-irritating, non-aggravating moisturizer, the search continues.",1450137600,2015-12-15

5.0,"For many years, I've wondered how my hair stylist makes it look so easy when she's blowdrying my hair.  I'd watch her technique and try to mimic it at home, but it was never the same.

My hair is shoulder length with a few long layers and my round-barrel brush would never glide through my hair while I'm drying it at home.  Instead, my damp hair would just stick or snag on the brush.  So, for years, I've been doing more of a full blowout each time, separating out each small individual section, wrapping it around the brush, fully drying it, and then moving on to unclip another small section to repeat the whole process.  And, sure, the time-consuming blowout looks nice and full and great--but who has time for that each and every time?

All this time, I've assumed that ""I"" was the problem--like maybe I'm blowdrying-challenged or something.  But, no, it now seems that it was more the brush than my own inadequacies.

I've been using 2"" metal-barreled Goody and Conair brushes for I don't know how long and I'd *thought* that my latest one was particularly nice with its squeezy gel handle.  But after reading some of the reviews of this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bio-Ionic-Blue-Wave-Nano-Ionic-Conditioning-Brush/dp/B001RUYKVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bio Ionic Blue Wave Nano Ionic Conditioning Brush</a>, I decided to order it and give it a try as a change.

I'm now a blowdrying wiz.  (Okay, not really...but much, MUCH better than what I was before.)  The slightly 'squared off' barrel allows you to catch the hair down near the roots to get lift there.  The best part, though, is that the brush does that gliding thing that my hair stylist's brush does.  You know, where the brush lifts up at the roots and then glides down the whole length of the hair section as you're drying it--and then, with a slight roll of the brush, starts right back up at the roots again.  I was never able to do that with my old brushes without it snagging and stopping.

I'm really not sure why this brush works so much better for me.  Is it the squarish shape of the barrel that does it or is it the ""Natural Ion Complex"" that the bristles are supposed to be infused with that allows the brush to glide?  All I know is that it takes me less than half the time to dry my hair now and the finish is much smoother.  Highly recommended.",1423440000,2015-02-09

4.0,"I have large, almond-shaped eyes and very straight eyelashes.  I have found that Asian-made eyelash curlers tend to work best for my eye shape.  I used the Shu Uemura curler for years but they are often faked - you really should order directly from them if you want to be sure you are getting the real thing.  I have been looking for a replacement & I like to try new things.  This may be it. It does catch all my eyelashes & it does curl them well without making an obnoxious crimp.  It does take a bit of practice if you have always used the traditional metal curlers but it's not difficult.

Because this is plastic, I can't heat it up (w/a hair dryer) like I do with my metal curlers.  I have very straight, hard-to-curl lashes so that was always my trick.  The curl lasted only marginally longer with heating & it seems to be about the same with this curler.  This curler beats my other curlers (I have a drawer full!) for the proper shape & non-crimping/more natural curl.  This is the closest I have come to the Shu Uemura.

3.0,"This was a miss all around, color was closer to brown then the mocha with some tan it shows. Also that could be a me issue, color wise, but it just plain didn't work. It was thin and drying and didn't leave any moisture so it just wasn't thick enough to cover. Which is amazing because so many of the products by this company are way to thick. Heres one that I thought would work well and its too dry. Like maybe I got a batch that forgot to add the moisturizer-- that would have made it perfect. Because of the nature of this product it seemed to dry out in places applied and have to be constantly re-applied. After a couple days trying for review purposes it definitely wasn't worth it. Might be a winner for people with especially oily skin since its matte and almost like a liquid powder with no real moisturizing. In fact maybe thats the intended use and it wasn't on the packaging.",1498435200,2017-06-26

5.0,"Wow! I love this Moisture Tint by Jouer!  The first thing I noticed is that it smooths on my face really well.  The second thing I noticed, and it blew me away, is that it really does reflect light!  My face looked light and glowing!  My skin looks so much brighter and natural than when I wear my foundation.

This is fairly light weight, but heavy enough to smooth the skin and provide some coverage.  I have dry skin, so this does not replace my normal moisturizer.  But it's great to have a skin-smoothing tint that's lighter than a foundation.

I would definitely recommend Jouer Luminizing Moisture Tint.",1403049600,2014-06-18
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20
3.0,"Vichy Neovadiol Gf Eye and Lip Contours is intelligently packaged. The tube will keep the ingredients from deteriorating over time. The well-shaped, metal applicator end is smooth and cool. Just the feel of its luxurious, soothing curves as I apply the cream to my undereye area makes me feel refreshed. And immediately after application there seems to be a plumping and illuminating effect that causes wrinkles to fade slightly. But after an hour or less, the plumping effect disappears and my skin returns to the way it looked before. So, the effects for me are immediate, but so far not long lasting. Ive only been using the cream for a couple of weeks and even Vichy indicates it takes longer than that for more significant results. On Vichys website, they claim this Neovadiol will produce visible results within 4 weeks. They specifically state that users saw the following reductions--
In 1 month:
  22.4% reduction in crows feet
  23.3% reduction of under eye wrinkles
  16.7% reduction in under eye bags
  33.7% reduction in upper lip lines
*clinical scores after 4 weeks of twice daily use

Since its pleasant to use, Ill keep using it, but I am highly unlikely to reorder. The ingredients are good, but not remarkable. The sixth ingredient is denatured alcohol, which is probably in there to make the cream absorb deeper. But Paula Begouns Beautypedia has a very convincing, long article about the dangers of denatured alcohol that concerns me.

3.0,"I can see where people think this is an eye treatment, and I guess it is, a bit. This is way more of a concealer; it's pigmented and has some pearlized material to deflect light (and get rid of the appearance of dark circles.) Although La Roche-Posay as a company has the reputation for a strong science component to their products, they are also a cosmetic company, and that's pretty much what this product is - a cosmetic.

It does contain caffeine, which has a diuretic effect to relieve puffiness. It also boasts something called Phe-Resorcinol, which I guess is their own proprietary compound. Resorcinol itself is an ingredient in argan oil. The company states that its own blend is ""known for its targeted action on melanin"", making it sound like this is some kind of skin whitener - all products that claim 'brightening' qualities are really talking about lightening.

Puffiness can cast a shadow, which can cause the appearance of dark circles. This particular product has a metal applicator. I gather the point of that, in using it to spread the concealer around, is that the cold metal will make the puffiness go away. You can get the same effect by putting a metal teaspoon in the fridge or in a glass of ice water, then using the back of the spoon to press down the puffiness (also watch salt intake, which causes water retention and adds to the puffiness.)

You might think caffeine would work on dark circles, but that would depend upon the cause of the circles. Some are hereditary, others can be lifestyle related (tiredness), or can come from age. If your circles have a brownish tinge, use an apricot colored pigment to counter it (this can be in a concealer or just put on the skin, then use a concealer); if your circles have a blue cast, try a yellowish concealer.

This particular product is fine as a concealer, but make no mistake. This is much less of a treatment than it is a cosmetic to hide, not cure, dark circles. Short of surgery and injections, nothing permanently gets rid of dark circles. But a good concealer, and knowing how to use it, isn't a bad second choice.",1445644800,2015-10-24

It looks and feels just like any other sunscreen, an off-white creamy lotion, but the Vichy does not have a strong odor and absorbs quickly, without a greasy residue.  The slight fragrance that the Vichy does have smells pleasant, and is barely noticeable.  In fact the Vichy reminds me more of a facial moisturizer with SPF 15 sunscreen that a straight-up SPF 60 sunscreen.  With that said, I won't be slathering the Vichy on my face daily, since it is not intended to be a daily moisturizer.  Rather I've been using it on my forearms and neck when I'm working in the yard, or spending a lot of time outdoors.  It's kept me protected for hours, and I haven't noticed any skin issues or irritation when using the Vichy.

My skin is still soft after cleansing and best of all, not itchy and I haven't had a single rash or breakout. It has a light fruity scent (watermelon?), fluffy lather and rinses quickly.

4.0,"Typically the Sephora brand (both Pro and Regular) has been my go-to for makeup brushes because I like the quality for the price.  But I've been hearing more about the Japonesque brand lately so I was curious to try these out, especially since the only fan brush I have is quite mini.

This style of brush is very useful.  It's nice for getting a soft dusting of setting powder (which is how I've been using it most often),  But it's also handy for cleaning up any product fallout you might get, in my case mostly from eye shadow.  I find the handle easy enough to hold, though since I am usually quick in sweeping on powder or cleaning up excess makeup, I'm not really using it long enough to notice any discomfort.  It also feels nice enough on my face.  I do wish the bristles were a tad softer, but they're not unbearably harsh either.  The softness reminds me more of the regular Sephora line vs. Sephora Pro.  I will also add that I haven't washed it, yet.  So I'm curious to see how well it will continue to hold a fan shape (or be reshaped to look like new) after being washed.

Overall for the price, I think this is a very nice brush",1459296000,2016-03-30

The small pump bottle works flawlessly, the fragrance is nice - a tad on the strong side but pleasant so forgiveable. Those with allergies or strong sensitivities may want to skip however to be on the safe side...at least find a sample product before buying. Of course the real question is the shine and that is where this really distinguishes itself. I'm past the half century mark, live in Florida where the high heat and humidity combined with harsh sun and chlorinated water takes a HEAVY toll on hair...especially aging hair. The only shine my hair normally gets is silver grey showing through.

4.0,"Though I use beauty products, I really don't know too much about them. I go by ratings and price most the time. So I had no idea what a BB cream was until I looked it up. Essentially, a BB cream is a moisturizer with added skin care benefits. It's tinted as well, and says it conceals imperfections, but in my opinion, it's really not thick enough to hide much.

However, it feels good on the skin. It has a nice scent. If you're sensitive to fragrance, you may want to choose something else.

The added qualities include antioxidant Vitamin E,  which is an anti-aging formula, 100% mineral pigments and pearl pigments, fortifying and soothing Vichy Thermal Spa Water. It's paraben-free, non-acnegenic. non-comedogenic (these all sound like made-up words to me, but what do I know), allergy-tested and made for people with sensitive skin.

Honestly, I hate the cost of beauty products. I'm not sure I would pay the $29 price tag for this, but if you're willing, it is a nice product.",1446076800,2015-10-29
4.0,"The market for looking younger is seemingly endless. As a result companies give us countless face creams since thats where our age usually shows the most. So, I was obviously a little skeptical when trying this.

One of the biggest ways to look older (and just generally not attractive) is to have dry skin. This is where the serum comes in. It claims to hydrate skin to make it look healthy, radiant, and youthful. And, in this way, it succeeds.

Its getting to that time of year when I struggle with dry skin, so it was a good time to try it. I have tried it out for a week and have noticed that my skin looks better. It also even feels better.

The texture is best described as milky. But, it doesnt feel overly oily or sticky. It absorbs nicely with no noticeable film. Also, the smell is a bit strong at first, but I have found this goes away within minutes. Use it at night if you're worried.

The product contains Aquabioryl, which it is claimed to hydrate the face and keep a protective film over the skin. It also has Hyaluronic Acid, which is known as a humectant, meaning its a moisture binding supplement that, when applied topically, keeps the skin fresh and hydrated.

So, the product has the right ingredients and works. Why did I take off a star? The price. I get that this is typical for these serums, but its way too high. One ounce is barely anything.

The product has worked for me, but I advise to use it sparingly to make it last.",1446076800,2015-10-29

4.0,"This is not what I would call a ""day cream""--that implies a moisturizer for day time, vs., say a night cream--a thicker, less makeup-friendly glop. A day cream would provide, typically, moisture that won't cause makeup to smudge or cake in wrinkles, a sunscreen of 30 spf or more, and some nice skin care ingredients--antioxidants in particular, which are needed to counteract sun exposure. This is not most of those things. It is a nice serum-primer. It has antioxidants, as well as some nice repairing ingredients like ceramides and peptides (as opposed to resurfacing kinds of ingredients like retinol and AHAs and BHAs--fair enough--the first two can be an issue with sun exposure, anyway.). You would want to wear this on cleansed skin, but you might want to add a moisturizer over it before using a sunscreen. The TIZO primer and the various sunscreens are excellent.

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

I wore Clinique Happy for years with it's orange scent, so this smell doesn't bother me at all.  My skin isn't sensitive, so I can't point to whether it works better for those with sensitive areas, but I did feel that dry areas were taken care of and oily areas weren't over moisturized.  After trying this, I would certainly consider other products in the line.  Give it a try...nice, simply, no frills or promises other than to keep your skin hydrated and feeling soothed.",1435104000,2015-06-24
5.0,"Very slight scent which I found very really pleasant.  Went on easily and was quickly absorbed.  I like it better than any body cream that i've tried in the past, including the many i've tried which were very, very expensive.

I've been using this powder for several weeks now and I don't really notice a difference in the appearance of my breakouts when I put it on and they don't seem to heal any faster.  I do notice a difference in shine, though.  This powder definitely helps to control shine.  I'll continue to use this product until I've used it up, but I don't think I'm going to reorder.

5.0,"I am always unsure about ordering retinol.  I have extremely sensitive skin.  This cream did not bother me at all!  It takes just a small amount dabbed around the eyes.  I use it only at night.  It is impossible to say if it will be effective without more time.  I like the way it feels after I rub it in.  No fragrances, either!  Tube is small but should last quite awhile.

4.0,"Juicy Couture Viva La Noir Eau de Partum is marketed for evening & special occasion wear.  It boasts that it will embody the woman who is dangerous - but in a good way.  While I'm not quite sure what that means, I can say that a little spray of this Juicy partum will grab you by your senses and will continue to provide a strong scent for quite a long time - even if the skin area gets wet.

Scent-wise, this partum is suppose to have floral top notes and vanilla & candlewood lower notes.  I expected to smell more mandarin (dangerous, right?), but my nose says gardenia & vanilla come through the most.

If you are a Juicy fan, then you know what scent you are purchasing and how the scent interacts with your body. For those buying without smelling, this Juicy scent is a very sweet, floral/vanilla scent more than a musky mandarin scent.",1458518400,2016-03-21

5.0,"I have a Phillips cleansing brush that I've owned for a couple of years, and have been very happy with it - until now. The LumbRx has so much more going for it, looks, functionality and beautiful packaging, etc. that I'm having a hard time finding anything critical at all - this would make a perfect gift for any woman in your life.

The outside box was very attractive and sturdy, and inside came a lovely shiny vinyl case for the cleansing brush, the charger and the three heads (one of which is a massage thingy, added bonus and very cool). I prefer the gentle brush, and it's very, very soft on my aging skin. More bonus points.

Set up was very easy, and I like the way the charging unit works at the base of the brush, as opposed to the more confusing way to plug in my old Phillips brush. More cool points for the LumaRX was the flashing lights at the top of the brush (where the brushes clip in) when it was charging.

All around, this is a very attractive item, works well, is packaged beautifully, small enough for a small bathroom counter. It can be used in the shower, but per the instructions NOT for submerging in the bathtub. I couldn't be a happier consumer, and I would consider this as a gift for a friend, or one I would recommend others buy for that special lady in their life.",1457222400,2016-03-06

Stunning with grays, jewel tones, and a real pop with black. I like Essie because it stays on nicely without chipping. Essie always has the perfect updated colors. This color will look great with whatever you wear this winter (The Lace is On).
  Also bought another 2013 color, Vested Interest. This is a lovely matte color, a greenish gray, that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors. Love the slightly edgy vibe, but super wearable, and looks fabulous on short nails.",1378080000,2013-09-02
5.0,"Great smelling mint scent. Makes your scalp tingle and lathers up really well with just a little bit.
Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow dry!

One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you're not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.

Nothing too horrific though - even when left on for longer than the suggested 10 minute application time.

It helps tone and moisturize the face, and it also helps me feel refreshed after a tiring day before retiring for the night. It simply feels pleasant, aromatic (not too much overly, just the right for me), relaxing. I did not use cotton ball, but just directly sprayed a bit and massaged onto face and neck. Rosewater has been suggested as a beauty remedy in Asian countries since old times, and no wonder, it does work.

My favorite thing about this, aside from how easy it is to apply (it doesn't dry out too fast, I can take my time with it)  is how my skin feels velvety smooth, not gummy or sticky like some products can make my skin.

5.0,"I am using this more for a concealer and I apply it with a makeup sponge using a tap-tap application rather than rubbing it in.  That does not work for me.  This covers my Rosacea and my sun damage spots, which as I age, are becoming larger.

There is a learning curve to using a Dermablend product as I found out after applying too much and looking like a clown.  Start out with LESS and if need, build on that, but when I used less product and gently worked with it, it morphed onto my skin.  Not into the skin, but onto it with a lovely finish. It did not settle into pores or fine lines.

I have yet to use the setting powder, but for the length of time I have this on, it stays in place.

I have tried so many products to cover my issues and none have been satisfactory,  Now, after hearing about Dermablend for many, many years, I am finally using it and am happy with the results.

If you are near a store that carries it, it might be more productive to go in and see the colors on your skin before buying and see what works best for you.  Then, for future purchase do it online where it might be less expensive.

Give it a try, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by just covering up a mark or tattoo or scar that you are self-conscious about.  I know using it has made me want to take better care of my skin.",1498176000,2017-06-23

3.0,This is a fairly heavy candle in a glass container which is recommended to burn for up to two hours at a time. The candle emits a fairly mild odor which is unlike anything I have ever sniffed but it is not offensive. The primary purpose of the candle is to try to mellow down the scent coming out of the gas pipe that is our pet Dobie. Certain foods set off his gas producing machinery and the result is very unpleasant. This candle does help a bit.,1442275200,2015-09-15

5.0,"It's a very pretty color, and it has smooth application.  I put 3 very thin coats on and my nails look flawless.  In sunlight, the silver shimmer is very beautiful, but still subtle.  It's a very summery feminine polish. The color looks like a shimmery less pastel version of Coral Reef by Sally Hansen.  I painted my nails with Sunday Funday last night and they haven't chipped 24 hours later.  Usually I chip polishes fast because my nails are in awful condition from school, work, guitar, and piano.  But it's held up so far with a top coat.  Definitely in my top 5 favorite polishes out of the 50-something I have.

On a side note, the polish arrived very fast, a day before the shipment stated.  The polish was properly wrapped in bubble wrap and then put into paper packaging that was encased with bubble wrap as well.",1374710400,2013-07-25

4.0,"As I mentioned in my last review, I have a serious issue with dry skin during the winter.

I didn't realize the moisturizer in this set was the same as the single one I had ordered as well. Ah. Well. I guess I'm just set on facial moisturizers for life. Or maybe I can gift the other one!

Again, I didn't realize this set was geared towards men but it's okay!

The face wash is nice. Using female products sometimes is a hassle since you don't know what things will smell like (like my Simple exfoliate --- smells like really strong hair dye) or how your skin will react to the product. I like how the face wash didn't dry out my skin nor did it have any strange strong smell. Also this bottle will last me a good amount of time!

The toner I don't use too often since I'm not exactly sure what it's for and because my skin gets really dry I'm scared that it will dry it out even more or you know... sting since I'm not sure if my skin has cracked or not. But I do love the scent of this! Again, the bottle is a good amount so it'll last you awhile.

I've already reviewed the moisturizer on it's own individual page.

Overall I'm pretty happy with this set!",1392768000,2014-02-19

It's good for keeping mild acne at bay but will probably do nothing for more severe cases. What makes this a bit different is its moisturizing properties.

The lotion is very light, absorbs easily, and makes the skin soft without being greasy.  I would not have needed this when I was younger and gushing oil, but I like it now that I'm older (with acne) and my cheeks get drier.

I love the scent!  Kind of beachy.",1460419200,2016-04-12

The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.

I'm so relieved to have found this - it's so nice to be able to exfoliate without worry!

I have to confess, when I first put it on my skin and it started balling up immediately, I kinda flipped out, thinking that anything that was reacting that quickly could NOT be gentle.

5.0,"My hair has been thinning for the last 15+ years and I have done everything to make up for it short of a transplant - wigs, weaves, etc. even though my own hair is quite long. I heard about Toppik and got this small travel size because I just had a hard time believing it would actually work, and I didn't want to risk too much money on it. Well, I absolutely LOVE Toppik! I'm a cook and an artist so I have a good hand, which meant I was successful in my first attempt at applying it and it only took a few minutes. just aim over the area, and tap the fibers on. The hair on the top of my head is quite thin, so I did have to apply more than some others might have to, but it does what it says, and I was so thrilled it brought tears to my eyes and I am buying a larger size. Yes, you can run your hands through it, and yes, you can style it. If you have thinning hair, I cannot recommend this product enough. TIPS: I read it before in the reviews and now I know it myself - get a shade lighter than your hair. I got the Dark Brown, and it looks almost Black upon application. I am able to get away with it, but my next order with be the medium brown and I will mix them. Also, if you need to apply a lot of it, which I did, it will result in the Toppik-treated area looking duller than the rest of your hair. I tried a little shine spray with my hair out and some holding gel with my hair up, and both seemed to work in getting the shine back. Some folks have complained of itching, but I haven't had that issue. I tried sleeping with it in just for giggles, and some came out, but not that much. I have not yet gotten it wet, so I cannot comment on that. If you're still skeptical, do what I did and at least try the travel size so your risk is minimal. But I am a happy customer - no more wigs and weaves and I can finally have my own hair out without being self-concious. Thank you, Toppik!!",1389052800,2014-01-07

This is a very luxurious cream that goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and hydrated.
Consistency is that of a thick cream rather than lotion but once applied leaves no greasy residue.
I have combination rather than dry skin and expected this to be too heavy for me. But it absorbs so well I can see it working for all but the oiliest of skin types.
I also noticed that my makeup - even my drug store foundation - looks much better since I have been using this cream.
The only drawback for me is the scent, but at least it is faint and doesn't linger.
I truly am the last person to tout such an expensive product but the difference this has made in my skin is amazing.
At this price, it is a luxury product but if you can afford it, it is worth giving a try to see if it works for you.",1418342400,2014-12-12
5.0,"This product is beautiful and stays on without smudging.  Now, I also use the Blinc Lash Primer first, so I don't know what the performance would be without using the Primer.  I'll save the primer review for that product.

What I like is that:
1.  There is no clumping.
2.  Length of lashes is increased easily by applying additional coats.
3.  Lashes really don't come off unless I use water AND rub the lashes off.  Thus, neither rubbing ONLY nor water ONLY will remove these lashes.
4.  I don't need makeup remover to remove these lashes like with waterproof mascara.  And waterproof mascara smudges when you rub--these lashes don't smudge--they come right off without pulling out my natural eyelashes.
5.  It doesn't irritate my eyes, skin, or hurt my natural eyelashes.
6.  Instructions say don't put on any moisturizer, etc., before using the product because that may make it harder for the product to stay on.  Well, I do use my eye cream first, and I wait a few minutes before applying the Primer.  So I have not had a problem with the product adhering to my lashes.  Again, this may be because I'm also using the Primer first.

Also, I use this Dark Blue color even though I'm African American, my eyes are brown, and my eyelashes ""appear to be naturally black.""  I read somewhere that the Dark Blue color really makes brown eyes ""pop.""  I was concerned about the color, but now that I have worn it, I will never purchase black mascara again.  As an African American, it was important to me that my eyelashes add something more than just length.  The Dark Blue color does appear to be Black from far away.  People notice it's Dark Blue when you're up close and especially when your eyes are wet.  Gosh, I look good wearing this color, and whoever said the color would make my eyes ""pop"" was right.

I have no ""dislikes"" for this product.  I really cannot find enough great things to say.  It's worth every penny.  And when you start wearing this product, your friends will ask you what you have on your eyes.  The next comment is typically ""oh I'm going to have to steal that""--:).

4.0,"I have started seeing Micellar water pop into the market including at the high end makeup shops.

I read online that Micellar is somewhere between a toner and a cleanser.  It should remove makeup (waterproof formulas too) dirt and oil from the skin without stripping your completion.

According to dermatologist Dr. Macrene Alexiades-Armenakas, it all comes down to little molecules called micelles. ""Micelles are nano-sized, single-layer fatty bubbles,"" explained Dr. Alexiades-Armenakas. ""They are able to absorb other fats such as sebum and oils inside."" Consider: though olive oil and balsamic vinegar separate from each other, two oils would blend together. So, by using a lipid to cleanse your skin, the oils on the surface join up and leave you squeaky-clean. (PopBeauty Sugar)

So this lists that it is: Soap-free. Alcohol-free. Colorant-free. pH-balanced. Allergy-tested. Non-comedogenic. Suitable for sensitive skin. Safe for contact lens wearers.

So what did I think?
I do not have waterproof makeup but I thought it took off my mascara decently. I would go over my eyes one more time with my eye makeup remover.  I also felt like it made my eye lids stick (I could feel it when I blinked) .  I don't have anything negative about it that I noticed after trying it for a week.  I used it with a round makeup wipe and I defiantly would see lots of makeup on it.  I would use this as an after facewash / after shower type cleanser / toner and not as my face wash alone.",1445644800,2015-10-24

A little goes along way and if you have multiple shades you can really get a natural look. I and adding my review of the concealer and mousse because I really like this line of product.
This Dermablend concealer does a great job evening out my skin tone. Using the Ivory 10N lightens the shade under my eyes. I currently am using it with my other brand Light shade coverage because I have gotten more sun than normal this year and Light is a closer match than Ivory currently yet I am very pale during winter. The two blend together well and look very natural. I am also using the Dermablend blurring mousse foundation. This product is fantastic in covering redness, age spots, and blue veins. I love that it has a built in SPF 25 that is Titanium Dioxide based. I always test color on the back of my hands because the skin is similar to your face. I found this made the skin on my hands look so nice that I been wearing it there to. The tops of my hands look good and have that SPF protection.

4.0,"I had mixed results with this product. I followed the directions exactly because I didn't want to end up with a blotchy skin tone. The mitt is very nice and does a good job helping to get this tanning lotion applied evenly. However, if you happen to have dry skin patches like I do, the tanning lotion gets stuck there and will not smooth out. Therefore, you have dark spots everywhere you have a dry skin patch.

It does spread nicely on smooth skin, and the mitt helps to blend it in nice and evenly if you're really careful about not putting on too much at a time. The color is nice. I was hoping it wouldn't be orange, because who wants to look like Donald Trump? It does not have an orange tint. The tanning looks quite natural as long as you do light applications at a time. This can stain your clothes if you're not careful. Especially white clothing. I would not wear white soon after application to be safe. And honestly, I think this stuff is way overpriced at $65.00.

I didn't get them with my first child, and moisturized religiously (not with this cream, though).

I didn't really like the bust serum much--it was truly a serum and less hydrating than the belly cream. Again, I didn't feel like it did anything.

The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well.

If you have oily skin, absolutely give this a try.  If your skin is combo or dry, PREP YOUR SKIN.  Exfoliate, moisturize, throw on some rose water.  Then let this warm on your skin (or in your hand) before you try blending it.  My skin is combo/dry and this formula was much hard to work with than I anticipated.  (Also, use a setting powder, it, ironicially, helps it look less dry.)

As for coverage, I would describe this as fair to good, but far from exceptional.  I confess that I was expecting more from this brand's reputation.  Amazon has given me the option to try a wide variety of Demablend products, and with the exception of the setting powders and *possibly* the pigment drops, there's really nothing I've tried that I think I would try again. The coverage has (on none of them) met the hype of the brand's reputation.  They've been above average (compared to products from other brands), but they aren't ""amazing"" and I've found almost every product to be drying.

ALL color images for this brand look lighter than the color in person.  I would suggest you seek out additional color images (or visit a cosmetic counter) before deciding on your color selection.

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me.

This is an interesting foundation that is in a neatly sealed package that keeps the foundation moist.  It is very pricey for the amount of foundation you get.

It feels a bit weird when you put it on, very cool on your skin because of the water in it.  I applied it with a foundation brush and you really have to dig the brush into the foundation to get enough product on it.

The color, Bisque, was great for my winter (sun-deprived) skin.  My skin color is usually light to medium.  When I first put it on I was super impressed.  It doesn't give great coverage, but it does look very natural and glowy and does a decent job evening out your skin tone.  It feels great too once it dries, very light...you barely notice it's there.

Unfortunately I was really not impressed with the staying power.  After a couple hours I noticed it had rubbed off my nose and was starting to wear off on other portions of my face as well.  It dismally failed the ""nap test""...how my make-up looks after I take a nap.  The whole side of my face that was on the pillow was rubbed off.

I tried putting my favorite winter primer right now,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palladio-Herbal-Foundation-Primer/dp/B003KPIIKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palladio Herbal Foundation Primer</a>, on underneath it but that didn't really help the staying power.

I first use their Dermablend Blurring Mousse with SPF 25. That covered the redness and gave me some protection on top of the zinc sunblock I already use. That zinc stuff leaves me looking super shiny with a white coating on top of my red face - not good. The Blurring mousse covers the white sunblock and red face, this setting powder removes the oily shine. Result is - I look like I have a nice natural face free of redness and oil. My redness is natural and the sun just makes it worse, add my oily skin and well, I get self conscious. SO I am loving this stuff. This powder leaves my face looking dry. Truth is it's also lasting all day even with light sweat. When I pat my face I barely see a hint of color, so its not wearing off nor getting on my collar.

4.0,"This palette is amazing because of it's versatility.
By lightly using the neutral 'Pro Basics' pans you get a shimmer that can be played down, or just use a small dab of the very lightest one in the inner and outer corners of your eyes to brighten and make them look bigger.
Those looks are certainly appropriate for day wear.
When you feel like having fun, layer on the glitter metalic colors for some serious hi def glam.
And even those, if lightly applied, give the look of freshly fallen snow. Each tiny bit of glitter sparkles as you move, a mesmerizing look.

Here's what is not so great...that glitter tends to travel. A primer is a must here. And after application, the two purples have that grey muddiness that purple shadow often has.

Still, this is such a fun palette to play with and get creative. Palettes are a terrific way to try lots of colors at a much lower cost than single pans or even quads. You might not love them all, but there are always a few that make it worth the price.
For me, the copper with a dab of the lightest one in my inner corner is gorgeous, and worth the price of the collection.",1444780800,2015-10-14

5.0,"This is my favorite, all-time lip tint. It is a stunning, sheer shade of red that literally looks wonderful on everyone. It's not sticky, waxy, and it doesn't feel like vaseline some other tinted balms I've had. It smells just like fresh, wet, garden roses and your lips are actually nicer at the end of the day after you wear it.

I have dry skin and lips, so I usually steer clear of tinted balms since I like to layer it on several times a day, and other products tend to cake on dry spots, or oversaturate my lips with color so I look like I did when I used Bonnie Bell products excessively in middle school. With this, the color is so sheer and high quality that even if you re-apply for extra moisture, it still stays natural-looking and smooth. You can even wear it on top of lipstick if you want to subtly play with colors.

This is definitely a staple product.",1467590400,2016-07-04

5.0,"DJ Play That Song is a semi-neon purple color with red undertones. I say semi because it's not a blazing neon. It can be worn to work. It looks just like it is pictured in the bottle - pinkish purple. I tried to take pics after applying but my camera wouldn't capture the real color. I tried in sun/shade/indoors/lights.. but didn't work. The color is really pretty to naked eye.

Saturday Disco Fever is a bright pure orange color. This is not a very blazing neon, so I am able to wear it to work. It looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors. I felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in Summer. I was a little apprehensive at first because I personally don't like Yellow/Orange shades. But this color worked for me. It is more red-toned than yellow-toned. This dark Orange looks good on nails too.

The formula on both the polishes is great. Two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish. They dry quickly but dry matty-ish. So top coat is a must for me. I applied a base coat (OPI Base Coat), 2 coats of polish and a top coat (OPI Top Coat). They lasted more than a week on me which is rare :-).",1371600000,2013-06-19
5.0,"My husband has used Jack Black products in the past and has always been satisfied.  This is no different!  The product is non greasy, goes on smooth and vanishes quickly.  The product is white, but disappears.  There is no scent to this product which is nice because it doesn't interfere with after shave/cologne scents.  The product leaves your face feeling clean, not heavy or pasty.  This works well after shaving, or washing your face especially after being in the sun.  He did not notice his face feeling any ""tighter"" or less damaged in regards to wrinkles, but would recommend this as a good moisturizer.",1414627200,2014-10-30

3.0,"I like the Vichy brand; some time ago, I got hy Puret&eacute; Thermale Fresh Cleansing Gel Cleanser from Amazon Vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes I switch it up with other brands just because why not).It works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, I get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.

I suppose I should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized Id&eacute;alia Antioxidant Serum (which I interpret as ""daily moisturizer), the other products are ""deluxe sample sizes"" of Puret&eacute; Thermale 3 -in-1 Cleanser and Id&eacute;alia Night - bizarre because I would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.

The tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. There is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. I guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on Amazon, but I would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.

After restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the ""deluxe trial size"" vs full sized, I tried the product - and they are fine. I use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the ""serum"" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. I don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.

The bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. It is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on Amazon. I bought a travel-sized cleanser from Whole Foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from SheaMoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.

If you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. The products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. I might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if I get low on them and the price is right.",1495411200,2017-05-22

5.0,"This is obviously not meant to be a product for every day use, as it includes only 6 treatments, but the instructions don't tell you how often you can use it either. The first treatment did not have any visible effect that we could detect* (except feeling moisturized), and did one eye at a time to compare the ""before"" and ""after."" By the second and third treatment (done the morning and evening after the first), there was definitely a noticeable improvement of wrinkles, moisturization, and skin tightness after each following application.

It was great that there was no smell or color. The eye masks require gentle handling when wet, to keep from tearing. A treatment takes at least ten minutes, but my wife kept it on longer. The masks stays in place on your skin well so you can walk around and do things while you are waiting.  My wife also liked the small sample package of ""stem cellular repair eye treatment"", for use after the eye masks, and only wishes there was more. Altogether we were quite pleasantly surprised by how well the treatment works for reducing the appearance of wrinkles and hydrating the skin under the eyes. Great for an occasional boost and refreshment for eye wrinkles, and without harsh chemicals. Would definitely recommend to others.

3.0,"This seems like nice blush. It's very bright. You can see in the photo that it is brighter and darker than the color on the package. The package shows a more mellow and warm pink; however, the actual product is darker and cooler. The packaging is beautiful, but I try not to be swayed by packaging because you don't leave the house with the package on your face but the cosmetics inside.

Another reviewer said it was a warm pink, but I disagree because I think it's more neutral than warm. It's bright on my fair skin so I need to go very light with Petal Pink blush so I don't look like a drunken clown.

I've been using this and really like it because it's quite natural looking: https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Healthy-Blends-Sheer-Highlighting/dp/B00U2VQYZM/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1468255591&sr=1-6&keywords=neutrogena+blush",1468195200,2016-07-11

3.0,"This serum made largely with organic ingredients and salicylic acid is high quality, but to be honest I'm confused because it makes so many claims I'm not sure who it's really suited for. On the one hand, it sounds like it's for acne (which I'm too old to have) but on the other it claims to also unclog pores, even skin tone and hydrate and have ""age defy results"" - which are issues I do face. So I've tried it a few nights and if I'm going to be honest my face feels too dry, not hydrated and itchy. I've tried to compensate by applying a rich face cream over it but the itch doesn't go away. The bottom line for me is that I believe this may be good for younger people with acne as it has a list of ingredients suited for acne and it's balanced with some ingredients so as to not over dry, but I just don't like it for my mature skin for the reasons stated and it just doesn't provide adequate hydration for me. This is better for my teen with acne. We applied it to his skin which does have acne and it tingles but feels ok to him. At first, it felt like it sat on the surface of his face without absorbing but then it eventually absorbed into his skin. I think the product should be more clearly defined  as a less drying acne treatment with organic ingredients as I don't think its good for mature skin yet may be excellent for my teen. He will continue use and update as to his results because this is not something you can clear acne with overnight, but I don't like it for me for the reasons above.",1416009600,2014-11-15

4.0,"I am always on the look for products that will help to keep my skin looking its best. My greatest concern is not wrinkles as much as the dark bags under my eyes, though I do tend to get wrinkles under my eyes when I smile. After discovering STRI VECHTIN LABS EXTEME CREAM, 1 FL OZ, I thought I'd give it a try.

I am a very frugal person, so the price is quite shocking to me. Even more shocking was the tiny amount for the price. However, I have to say I was very impressed with how little is needed. I expected I would need a good amount to cover my face and that it would feel heavy. Neither was true.

STRI VECHTIN LABS EXTEME CREAM goes on effortlessly, nice and easy, with just a few dabs here and there, and a true sense of lightness. The fragrance if neither good nor bad in my opinion, with a light lemony smell to it, if I had to name it. Though the price if high in my opinion, the fact that you only need a little, I imagine will result in lasting a long time, diminishing the high cost to something manageable over time.

As far as reducing wrinkles, I will update as I continue to use the product as to any noticeable differences. I admit I am a little concerned with the chemical aspect. Many products may do what they claim, but at what cost? Eating right, not wearing makeup, removing makeup before bed, no harsh chemicals, the environment, getting the proper sleep, the temperature of the water you use, and what materials you use to clean your face with what degree of abrasion, can all play into your overall skin health.

5.0,"I have very dry skin, and it winter, it itches and cracks if it's not moisturized regularly. While this lotion is too expensive for me to use year-round, it's wonderful in winter to soothe my itchy arms and legs and heal my cracked hands. I didn't find it sticky, as some reviewers did, but I'm usually negligent about my skin until it's gotten so dry I can't ignore the itching, so maybe with drier skin it absorbs more readily. I've found colloidal oatmeal products to be tacky though soothing, and this doesn't fall into that camp. One thing I really like about this product is that it won't irritate my skin if I've let it get so dry that it's sensitive. There are other dry skin products I use that are great with regular use, but irritate my skin if I've let it get too dry. This just soaks in and stops the itch.

Aside from excessive dryness and the accompanying sensitivity, I don't have any chronic skin conditions. This seems to be targeted more toward more serious skin issues, where the added expense would be more worthwhile year-round. For simple dryness, it makes more sense to use a cheaper product (i.e., whatever reasonably creamy lotion is on sale); but for winter itch, it's top notch and worth the price.

It's a reasonably large bottle with a solid pump, and I like that fact that it tapers down for efficiency.",1526342400,2018-05-15
4.0,"I tested this and a friend tested it, just to give you two perspectives.

My hair is very fine, and it's natural state is curls. Sometimes I do want to go straight and sleek though and that's where this product comes in. I used a half pump of the thick cream and spread it evenly through my damp hair and then styled, and for me, the frizz and flyaways I usually get stayed away. The formula did not weigh my hair down or feel greasy, and I like the fresh scent.

My friend has a harder time with hair product. She has medium thickness hair that is prone to static and is more noticeably ""frizzy"" especially on the top of her head. She used this product on her damp hair and then blew it dry and still had a moderate degree of frizz (though it did control the frizz better than most, she admitted).

So, basically, your milage may vary. It worked well for me, not so well for my friend. So try it, but perhaps don't hope for a miracle if your hair is especially difficult.",1493769600,2017-05-03

I have very long lashes, but they are skimpy and like to do their own thing and it's hard to get them to perk up. This product is amazing and really gives my lashes definition with just a few swipes of mascara. Before using this product, I would use tons of mascara, but this product just allows me to make a pass or two and then I am done. My lashes are SO pretty and almost look fake they look so nice!

5.0,"This sunscreen is wonderful. I bought it to wear over my morning moisturizer everyday. I have used other facial sunscreens that make my skin oily, so I decided to spend a little more than I usually would and try this. It goes on very light and leaves the skin matte, soft feeling, and most importantly like I didn't just apply sunscreen. The tint is several shades darker than my skin tone when I pour a bit into the back of my hand to put on my face, but it sheers out and isn't noticeable. The tint gives no coverage to any dark spots or acne. I apply my makeup as usual after using this and it doesn't affect my makeup at all.

 What's most impressive about this product is it's performance in the sun. One would think that such a light product that feels nonexistent on the skin would fail to protect you from the sun, but that's the farthest from the truth. I have used this one days of hiking, boating, swimming, and more, and I have never once burned. I once used this before going boating all day and when I got home I saw that I had burned on the tip of my nose and the top of my forehead where I forgot to apply the product, but nowhere else. On days in the sun I apply sunscreen all over my body every few hours, but one application of this product in the morning leaves my face ready for a day without requiring anymore sunscreen touch ups.

5.0,"It looks like water. It feels like water but it acts like super water. This large bottle of micellar water comes with a convenient pump. Essentially soft water with micelles, little grime grabbing molecules of oil, this makes for an effective, mild no rinse cleaner. It is great for easily irritated skin. Just pump some on a cotton ball or pad and apply to the face. It removes make up, dirt and oil leaving skin soft and soothed. This formulation has a light fresh fragrance. On work days when I wear a full face of makeup, I use this as an initial makeup remover, followed by my usual cleanser. I then swipe again instead of using a harsh toner. While it will remove light makeup, heavy foundations and waterproof mascaras have proven problematic. It gets some but not all so regular cleaning is required. But for no or lighter make up days it is terrific. It also is surprisingly effective at softening false eyelash adhesive, making removal easy and safe for you and the lashes. It is nice to have on hand if you travel or frequent the gym. I actually have been using some to clean make up brushes and it works well for that purpose too. this is a convenient solution for active women. I found it pleasant and easy to use.

4.0,"Shaving is one of the love-hate chores men face, pun intended, every day. Unless you're employed  as a lumberjack, it's an unavoidable chore that involves time, expense and sometimes wound management. Since skin sensitivity and beard toughness are unique to each man, there is no one universal best product when it comes to achieving a great shave so results vary and unfortunately require a lot of experimenting as to what works best for you. Baxter's Close Shave Formula is not a soap or product that needs to be worked into a lather. As other reviewers have also noted, if you normally use a badger hair brush, you don't need one with this product no matter what their advertising advises and it was counter productive to use one at least for me. The cream is pre-whipped and creamy and so only needs to be applied to a wet face with your finger tips and evenly worked into your whiskers. It is moderately thick and spreads evenly and quickly. I use a Merkur Progress Safety Razor with Dorco double edge blades and found the shave with Baxter's formula to be smooth and nick-free, welcome due to having very sensitive skin. The product density and slickness strike a good balance. It won't adhere to and clog a blade but dissolves easily with each rinse. You will use more of the product due to the fact it is ready to use as is and not a solid block that needs a brush to whisk it to build up a froth before application. It should still last several months, so the cost is not excessive if you find it gives you the results you want. Not requiring the shaving brush step, also saves a little time in the morning which is a plus. Consulting the ingredients you'll note after water, there's stearic acid, an emulsifier that binds all the ingredients together and is listed second in every shave cream I looked at. Listed third is soybean oil. The third ingredient seems to consistently be either glycerine or a specific oil to supply the viscosity and provide the ""glide"" factor.  If you want to improve your shave regardless of the cream or soap you use, try applying oil to your face after wetting it and before applying your shave cream. Shave oils are sold as such but can be extremely expensive. Emu oil is most like the skin sebum naturally produced by our own skin, but a few drops of olive oil is excellent. You should find your shave drastically smoother and the thin layer that remains after rinsing is a wonderful moisturizer used for thousands of years. In summary, Baxter is an effective product, does not require a brush, has a medium creamy consistency that distributes evenly, won't clog your razor mid-shave, extra protective of sensitive skin and is competitively priced. With the time saving factor and results I've had so far, it will become my shave cream of choice at the moment. If you prefer using a badger brush, try Taylor of Bond Street. Not cheap at around $16 for 5.2 oz., but a premium product if you're a committed Badger Brush user.",1374624000,2013-07-24

Though I am not exactly sure what a seaberry is supposed to smell like, this one has a nice and refreshing scent that is pleasant but not overpowering.

2.0,"I have had the occasion to use several Vincent Longo products and I realize that this line of products provides a high quality product for a pretty hefty price.  In most situations I have found you get a really good product for your investment.  However, in this case, I am just not sure about this one.

SIZE
Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base comes in a black tube which looks pretty nice on the product page, but in reality, when you get it, the small size is rather shocking. There is only .88 oz of product in the tube, which if you translate it, you can imagine three tubes of Jack Black lip balm and that is about the size of this product.

TEXTURE
I have tried many times to see what might be different about this primer compared to many others out there.  I have to say after testing this repeatedly, I just don't see any advantage of using this primer.

The feel of this product is that you use a pearl sized drop of this product applied around your entire face and eyes.  When I do this, I feel a lot of silicone feel to it.  This leaves my face feeling like it has saran wrap on it of sorts.  It is hard to explain, but after a while of wearing this primer, I feel like my face wants to breathe and I want to remove it.

AFFECT ON MAKEUP

This primer base definitely does smooth out the skin and does allow for the foundation and other face makeup to stay on the face nicely.  It seems to make the makeup stay on well through the day and it does add to a nice appearance of the skin.  I also find when using this, that blush does not tend to change color like some other primers can do.  I still did not enjoy wearing it over time, however, so I am not sure it served that great of a purpose.

FINAL COMMENTS

For the price, I just don't see how this product is worth the money.  I have normal to dry skin and I didn't feel any particular moisturizing features from this base.  I get much nicer results when using Swanson Vitamins Hyaluronic Acid Serum which is very similar to Lorac Aquaprime which was discontinued.

I just don't like this primer and didn't feel it is worth the investment.  You get so little product for a very high price.  Using it under Vincent Longo Water Canvas Foundation does make it look very nice, however, if you have the money to invest and want to use them together.  There are other options that are more cost effective, however if you prefer a less expensive alternative base to use.",1392249600,2014-02-13

This means it can't be used under makeup, e.g. but only for athletic uses and then has to be washed off carefully. Get the Cotz, it doesn't clump at all.

The sunscreen value is high and the scent is minimal, just an unscented cosmetic odor, not objectionable. There are no parabens. I haven't had a chance to research all the ingredients, but it seems to use alcohol as a preservative. For me, it's a choice between this and the Cotz Face Broad Spectrum Spf 40, which comes in different skin tones but has a lower spf.

I have sensitive dry skin.  I had tried this brand's serum and figured why not?  I don't have many signs of wrinkles yet but do have a few old acne scars, so a ""filling"" cream is something I'm willing to try even if that sounds like an unbelievable claim -- even if it benefits my skin in any way, it'd be worth trying.  I'd only try one other product that claimed to have any filling benefit (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Or-eacute-al-Paris-Revitalift-Volume-Filler-Daily-Volumizing-Moisturizer-1-7-Ounce/dp/B00PFEFHAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Or&eacute;al Paris Revitalift Volume Filler Daily Volumizing Moisturizer, 1.7 Ounce</a>) and it was at least a good moisturizer.

This filler, however, not only didn't have any ""filler"" benefit but also left my skin angry.  At first it did feel like there was something to it... Run my hand over my face and it felt pretty smooth.  Felt tight.  That's always a good feature from anything you're putting on your face.  Within minutes it felt dry and itchy.

May be for some people but for me?  Something in it is not agreeing with my skin.  Any benefit that it might offer isn't worth the reaction I had to it.  There's no ingredient list on the bottle, so I searched them out...  not sure what is bothering my skin, but something is.  Did not have this reaction with their serum so it's definitely something in this product and not necessarily in all of their product line.

3.0,"I don't know if something is wrong with my bottle, but the push button sprayer just will not work.  I press and press and almost have to stand on it to get the sprayer button to go down.  And when the spray button finally does go down a solid stream of liquid comes out.  The sunscreen drips off my arms/legs before I get a chance to rub it in.  Messy.

As for the sunscreen itself  I was always impressed with La Roche-Posys European Mexoryl version of sunscreens.  In the early 2000s I used to order the stuff from Europe because it had UVA protection and none of the US products had UVA components only UVB.  But then Neutrogenas Helioplex came on the market and I started using that.  I never thought the Helioplex was as good as the Mexoryl, but it was easier to get and a lot cheaper.  Now La Roche-Posay is being sold in the US, but it is missing that all important Mexoryl ingredient (which is still not approved by the FDA).  Comparing the two ingredient lists:

La Roche-Posy Anthelios 60 has (Avobenzone 2.68%, Homosalate 9.60%, Octisalate 2.88%, Octocrylene 5.38%, Oxybenzone 3.46%).

Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid has ((Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 7.5%, Oxybenzone 5%).

So almost exactly the same ingredient list with just slightly different percentages, and the La Roche-Posy is about 3 times the price.  Hummmm.  In my research I also discovered how harmful the Oxybenzone is (EWG hazard level of 8 out of 10).  Im so confused.  I think I might try and find some sunscreen with the Mexoryl (EWG hazard level of 2 out of 10).

I personally try to only use the newer chemical sunscreens when I absolutely have no other choice.",1502409600,2017-08-11
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

I hit 10 minutes) and wash off. It comes off easily and only tingles my skin for the first minute. It doesn't leave my skin dry or red. Highly recommended.",1373500800,2013-07-11

The polish went on very smooth {I always were a bottom coat}. I only had to put 2 coats on to achieve the desired color. I loved it!! I am a faithful fan of Essie now, with DJ Play that Song as my most favorite polish color. It is a slight neon purple color, however not to bold. I have it on my toes now and receive tons of compliments.",1375488000,2013-08-03
4.0,"If you've never tried Jane Iredale products you should give them a try. I've yet to try one of her cosmetics I haven't liked. This Lip Balm in buff color is really terrific and I am now use it at night to moisturize as well as during the day,

I like to use it during the day with a nude lip liner because it adds just the slightest color to my lips and makes them stand out yet not look overdone. For this reason it is nice if you just are going out for the day and want a natural look for your lips.  If however, you're looking for something that would really add more color you may want to try one of her other lip color  products. This one works more like a gloss.

Recommended. I'm obviously a big fan. My only critique is that it doesn't moisturize as well as I'd like; a simple chopstick almost works better but this obviously looks better.",1489795200,2017-03-18

5.0,"I am a big fan of the Juice Beauty line.  I am a regular user of the green apple peel as well as those regular facial moisturizer.  I was given a chance to try out this clear skin kit and have had great results with it.

My problem area is my forehead.  I have a tendency to end up with clogged pores on my forehead.  It presents as little bumps.  The bumps aren't pimples and definitely not acne.  They seem to be clogged pores.  After a week of using the Clear Skin Kit, the bumps have disappeared.  I have never been able to get them to completely disappear before, so I am very happy.

Each element of this kit has been easy on my skin.  I am sensitive to odors and the scent from these products is minimal and quickly dissipates.  A small amount of each one goes a long way and I estimate that the items should definitely last a month, if not more.  My only quibble is that it's difficult to get the precise amount of product I want out of the tubes.  I often end up squeezing out more than I need.  I wish that instead of squeeze tubes they used little glass jars or tubes with little pumps.

Overall, I am very happy with this kit.  I have seen nice results.  Lastly, I feel comfortable using Juice Beauty products because they don't test on animals.",1441584000,2015-09-07
5.0,"I have been a connoisseur of shaving with top end shaving creams and using an authentic Badger hair brush. I am picky about my products because I believe shaving is an art. I did not expect to be overly impressed with L'Occitane CADE Shaving Cream but I was. If you are just a squirt from the can kind of guy this may not be for you. There is no doubt that you can rub in in your hands and apply it to your face and get a decent shave, but this cream works best for me when applied directly to my shaving brush after it has been moistened with hot water (before applying the Cream to the moistened brush shake the brush once to eliminate excess water saturation). The amount of Cream squeezed from the tube to the shaving brush should be no more than the length of toothpaste you would squeeze onto your toothbrush. There is no need to spread this Cream on your shaving brush. Instead, working the brush starting on either side of the face using a circular wrist action will begin to work up this cream into a lather as you work he brush on your face. Once you have covered your face by circular motions, use a back and forth motion with your brush to make a consistent, smooth creamy layer on your face. I won't go into shaving technique but I found that this Shaving Cream significantly reduced the nicks I got in the shaving process. I still get nicks but they are few and far between and I don't get nicked every time I shave. To get the most out of your completed shave with L'Occitane CADE Shaving use very warm water to rinse your face and follow up with splashing your rinsed face with cold water.",1418947200,2014-12-19

5.0,"This is the best eye make-up and mascara remover that I've ever tried. It even removes that thick type mascara that goes on in one or two swipes and looks almost like fake eyelashes. The stuff looks pretty great until you go to remove it. You know how even after you think you have mascara all off, you wake up in the morning with fake dark circles under your eyes from leftover residue you didn't notice the night before? Well, this remover will get all of that off with very little effort. It seems to melt all the blackness away. It has a slight oily feeling, but not enough to leave a lot around after you wipe it off. There's just enough to soften the skin around your eyes and provide a little moisture. And it's fragrance free, a great feature in a make-up remover that you use around the eyes.

The product looks just like it does in the picture with 2 layers. I had to shake it pretty hard to make it stay combined long enough to pour some on a tissue to apply it. But it worked perfectly, so who am I to complain?",1489536000,2017-03-15

But, because it takes a lot of product to shampoo and condition thicker hair, the trial sizes won't go far.  I won't be able to eke more than a second shampoo and conditioner application out of them.  I've found that I generally need more than that to do a sound assessment of shampoo:  allergies and sensitivities often don't show up--or recede--until I have used the product for more than ten days.  That's obviously not an option here.  Would I go out and buy the full-sized products just to be able to test the shampoo (etc) adequately?  Maybe, when the product is inexpensive.

5.0,"All Hail the Queen was my first bottle of polish by Butter London. Tired of thin polishes from Essie and not really excited by OPI at the moment, I finally decided to give this brand a try. I've purchased a bottle of Chanel polish before, but $15 for nail color still seems steep to me. I picked this color because it seemed safe lol and I just wanted to try the product line.

I really do like the color. Having brown skin it's not exactly nude but a nice neutral color with a hint of sparkle to break up the monotony. The application reminded me a lot of the Chanel bottle I have. Not just the removable top cover, but the fact that it brushes on neatly. You won't end up with too much on the brush, minimizing clean up and product waste.

The color itself is nice and with a top coat it reminds me a little of those old Sally Hansen prism polishes, minus the color change effect. I do like the texture of the polish and it's wearable with or without a topcoat. This color can also be worn well at one or two coats. The drying time was fast, but I can't speak too much for the longevity yet. I see complaints about chipping polish, which may be solved by making sure your nails are smooth, well buffed and totally clean of all oils. After a day of wear, shampooing my hair etc my polish was still intact, at least. (I used Out the Door topcoat)

I'm not saying I'm a Butter London fan just yet lol, but I did like this polish enough to order a second color. When I saw my polish outdoors the next day, I ordered 3 more bottles of Butter London polish from Amazon lol. While I'm sure other companies out there make a color comparable to this one, I'm happy I finally gave this brand a try.",1386201600,2013-12-05

We tried leaving it on for 2 minutes and 5 minutes and 10 minutes and used it probably 5 times a piece over a two week period.

It has made my skin very soft and smooth.  It also has done a really good job at shrinking my pores.

Let it dry.  (I mean let it dry for hours!!!) then put CND's UV top coat on and marched forward another few days with another new look which was more gray/silver.

Im currently dealing with massive breakage due to over-drying my hair and overuse of a flat iron.  This oil in conjunction with the Lanza Healing Oil Shampoo and Conditioner is bringing hope back to my life.  The combination of these three products has made my hair feel like it hasn't felt in years.  I forgot hair could feel this healthy.  I don't care if its expensive This stuff is worth every penny.  For those who are concerned that its a fake product, I can tell you that mine wasnt.  Ive taken a picture of the bottle I purchased about three months ago at a reputable beauty supply store and the product I received from Amazon yesterday.  They are exactly the same; the text on the bottle, the aroma, the feel of the product.  The exact same.  When I use this product, I usually dry my hair slightly, let it air dry a few minutes, put about a quarter size in my palm and pull it through my hair.  If you put the oil in while your hair is damp, itll speed up the dry time, and then if you want to add a little more at the end for shine, you can do that.  I use it pretty liberally, and its taken me three months to get through half of a bottle.  The only caveat I would have is that I don't love the aroma.  Its hard to describe perhaps a little powdery, a little old-lady perfume-y.  That being said, the product is so good, Im willing to overlook that.  Give your hair a treat!",1497744000,2017-06-18

This works great on my hair, which is fairly long and fine, I would have liked to be able to reduce the heat, since my hair is thin but I didn't seem to have any breakage while I was using it to test it out. For me, I would benefit from having my daughter come over to use this on the back of my hair - which is where I have an issue doing it myself. Somehow, I do manage to get it done with my head upside down and then I got back to the very top for some volume. I like that this comes with a swivel cord, a large barrel, easy on off switch and a glove for holding your hair against the barrel. As I play with it more, I think I will get better with it and may have to do a blow out before I do the waves. It is simple easy to use. And you get instructions to guide you along. You will also need clips to section your hair, since the smallest amounts will work best for a defined curl or wave.",1518134400,2018-02-09

My face feels fresh, smooth and clean!",1412467200,2014-10-05
3.0,"This is an excellent exfoliating cleanser. It definitely does a first rate job; there is really nothing more that you could ask of a cleanser. But almost $40? That is a really high price. I mean, while you won't find a much better exfoliating cleanser, the real question is, do you really need to pay this much for these kind of results? Are there no other affordable products. I tend to be a basics kind of guy. I think in equivalences in certain circumstances. And here I have to think about basic human needs. Do I need enough groceries to eat for a week or do I need an exfoliating cleanser? Even if I have significant skin problems, I simply am not able to pay this much for a skin cleanser. If the notion is that this product, which addresses a real human need, is only targeted at those who can afford to resolve a real human need, then aren't we moving further than ever to a two-tier society? Some people can afford to pay $40 for exfoliating cleanser; most cannot. There are plenty of cleansers that do just as good a job  without the exorbitant price tag.",1486771200,2017-02-11

The neon color applies streaky and when it dries it almost looks like candle wax, even when applying a glossy top coat.

5.0,"I purchased this for my son's girlfriend and I'm so happy she grew to like this. It's perfect for her because she is new to Retinol. It did like it should  with a good retinol have a mild burning sensation which once she used several times it went away. She went through a little peeling process and I don't mean her whole face just areas that are dry is where it peeled which that too is normal for some. After I noticed her face was clear,smooth and healthy looking. What a difference this has made. I'm so greatful to the sellers here on Amazon that are able to offer this at an affordable price to customers. I never question the Authenticity of their products because I have used some products for years and after comparing them to the ones I purchased at my dermatologist I found the two are exactly the same. Only difference is the price. Lucky for us the's sellers can buy in bulk and sell to use much cheaper .will buy the stronger percentage for her once this bottle is gone.",1469836800,2016-07-30

I use it only in my morning routine, so I can see the small bottle will be very generous and is worth the cost. I have sensitive skin, and there has been no irritation.

This serum has a hyaluronic acid (hydrating, plumping) and antioxidants plus mushroom extract. It is tightening and feels good on the skin. A little goes long way.
If your skin is dehydrated definitely it will help to use it under good occlusive moisturizer (after cleanser and toner) that will prevent loosing hydration from epidermis.
Every skin can benefit from this serum as most of us has dehydrated dermis and epidermis. If you need stronger anti aging properties or have a pigment issue or acne you can combine 2 serums or use one in the morning and another at night.",1478390400,2016-11-06
5.0,"My skin is really dry, particularly after a long course of Accutane.  Winter weather can cause a lot of visible skin irritation from shaving, and most men's face washes are not targeted well to my skin type.  However, White Knight has been perfect.  It leaves my skin much more resistant to razor burn than other washes and, while more expensive than I am comfortable with, is recommended to anyone with very dry skin.

If you don't have such dry skin, you may want to try something a bit harsher, as this really doesn't get the dead skin off well.  Shaving is, of course, an extreme exfoliation in itself, but a cleanser this gentle might cause acne or razor bumps in some skin types.",1263427200,2010-01-14

3.0,"I would LOVE this product if it wasn't for the strong scent. I will grant you that the scent isn't unpleasant--who can dislike ""baby"" scent? It is just so strong and persistent that it doesn't fade away and just lingers. As a matter of fact, it seems that the warmth of the skin triggers the scent release because it doesn't seem as strong when you take a whiff of the cream in the tube.

Otherwise, it is great: it applies smoothly, is neither too watery or too thick; it is absorbed promptly allowing you to dress the child without having to wait for the cream to dry first; it does moisturize effectively. Other positive attributes include the ingredient list in which there is nothing to object to and the fact that it has been tested to avoid skin allergic reactions. (Although I wouldn't be surprised if the scent couldn't trigger a respiratory reaction in an asthmatic child!)

Despite its many virtues, I would prefer a less-effective product that is scent-free.",1493596800,2017-05-01

3.0,"I have medium tones of Southeast Asian ethnicity. My skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.

I definitely have use for a concealer for the body, as I have had unsightly bruising and/or small rashes from time to time. However, the trouble I have is matching the skin on my legs or arms to a concealer that will not only thoroughly cover but also last for a long time. I wanted to use the Honey 50C for my legs, as they are very tan with a yellow undertone. Despite the ""Honey"" moniker, this concealer did not have any yellow undertones that I could discern. It was very pink.  It definitely did not match my tan.

As I stated in my other reviews of other shades, this concealer is not as thick as I would prefer for a body concealer. It is thinner and oilier, does not fully cover and definitely doesn't last 16 hours, more like 3-4 hours.",1499558400,2017-07-09

I looked at my photographs from several years ago and noticed that the sun spots I had are gone today. This cream works as well as IPL treatment I used to have. It obviously takes longer to see the results but there is no pain and the cost of the cream compared to that of IPL make it a great investment. I use Nia24 Sun Damage Repair on the rest of my body with equally impressive results. I see no point in taking care of my face and neck while neglecting the rest of my skin.,1417132800,2014-11-28

5.0,"This review is for the complete gift set of 200 ml Micellar solution, and three 15 ml jars of masks (pore purifying clay mask with two mineral clays; double glow peel mask with volcanic rock and AHA; and quenching mineral mask with rare minerals and Vitamin B3). It appears our review is being directed to just one of the masks. Evaluating each part individually, the micellar solution is great for cleaning off makeup--especially eye makeup. Many other micellar waters gave my wife a burning solution around the eyes. This one did not irritate, and had a light, refreshing scent. This is absolutely her favorite brand micellar solution so far. She's never been disappointed with the quality of Vichy products.

Each 15 ml jar has enough masks for 4-5 uses, and my wife personally has an oilier, mixed skin type. The clay mask was her favorite, and seems to control the oil secretions the best. The mineral mask has a refreshing effect and smells like fresh cucumber and maybe a cooling mint sensation? Her least favorite was the peel mask, which smelled and felt nice, but seemed to have the least results, from before to after. It's the only one she would probably not buy again. Overall, she is very satisfied with these Vichy products, especially the micellar water and clay mask. The gift set comes in an attractive tin and would be great for a special lady. The scents might be strong for some who are sensitive, but my wife really liked them.",1504483200,2017-09-04
4.0,"Self-tanners have improved over the years so they're a little more fool proof and easier to apply.  Still it can be hard not to end up with uneven color somewhere, especially for tricky areas like fingers, elbows and knees.  This product is designed to help you blend in mishaps.  Simply get it wet, squeeze out the excess moisture and lightly rub over the problematic parts.  I don't disagree with the previous reviewers that it does feel like a magic eraser or similar products.  But for me the efficacy of this is part the material and part the design.  I really like how the points make it easy to get in between your fingers and toes easily if that is a trouble spot for you.  I will also agree that each of these isn't something you can get terribly many uses out of.  Because of that they're better for people like me who use self tanner very rarely, like for a vacation or a special event.  I could also see them being for someone who applies self tanner nearly flawlessly and likes to have a solution on hand just in case for infrequent mishaps.  However, if you're someone who self tans a lot and frequently makes mistakes you're going to likely need more than two.  For my infrequent purposes, however, they are nice to have on hand.  I also wish I had known about these as a maid of honor because they would have been handy to throw in our basket of day of emergency supplies since often bridesmaids and sometimes even the bride are using self tanner for the first time.",1422144000,2015-01-25

This make up has a medium feel and coverage. A very small amount goes a long way and covers a lot of area. It is not so thick that all you see is the make-up. It has good coverage, but is still transparent enough to see the texture of your skin. Most all quality make-ups these days have UV protection and this one is no different in that respect. This has moderate protection at an SPF of 25. It must be reapplied every 2 hours to maintain that protection if you are sun exposed. This is a nice make-up at a reasonable price.",1498435200,2017-06-26
4.0,"The first great thing I noticed about this cream is its jar. After removing the pull-off top, there is a white disc that covers the product completely. When you push down on it, the correct amount of treatment comes up through the little spout in the center of the disc. When you let go of the white disc, all that is on the white disc is the correct, pre-measured amount of treatment. I love this, because, for one, the entire product is not contaminated each time you scoop some treatment out. Also, this prevents the treatment from drying out, as creams often do. In addition, you get the correct amount each time, with no waste.

This product is very light and is absorbed into the skin as soon as it is applied. Consequently, you have to distribute it around your face quickly. It is free of scent, which lots of women like. Then, it doesnt clash with other cologne, etc. It is great for sensitive skin. I am always so cautious when trying new things, because I am prone to allergies and sensitivities. There was no burning or tingling and no redness or swelling. It was if I didn't even use it, except for the moisturizing on contact. It leaves your face hydrated and smooth and more elastic. It does seem to work. The price may prove a problem for many, however.

I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.",1473292800,2016-09-08

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

I prefer the Anthony's toner as it comes on a pad already but I do like the scent of the Baxter toner.  Neutral on the face wash seems to do the job.  What is nice about the Baxter is the price it does the same job of far pricer options for a fraction of the cost (my Anthonys toner pads were $22 and soap $22 my jack black $27 for $71 vs $45 for the Baxter 1.2.3.).",1389657600,2014-01-14

5.0,"While most of my adult life I have been a ""soap and water"" girl, getting into my late fifties I have become an anti wrinkle cream junkie.  I order my makeup online from Nordstroms or Neiman so I can get all the freebie anti wrinkle skincare samples they include to try.
I have used them all from Chanel, Kiehls, on to the Walgreens or Wamart offerings such as Neutrogena, Ponds Oil of Olay, and of course the pyramid scheming sales of Mary Kay, Arbonne and other up and coming companies your friends are selling as you try to hide and ignore the sales pitches.
I can say very honestly this is a luxury product and feels amazing on my skin.  Gently softens and works out the fine lines near my eyes.  A light sheen when first applied it seems to hold without stretch or drying, just floats on in a light white cream.  Silky smooth and my makeup goes on wonderfully after applied.  No splotches of buildup. Does NOT fade away, your skin feels protected.  You can come back and rinse your face after wearing for hours and you can feel the glide of the product still there, still protecting.  But not heavy you don't feel smothered either.  I just love it.  You also get a very generous amount in this plastic type tube bottle which I find is less wasteful and more sanitary that jar creams.  I squish out a small dab on the back of my hand near my thumb and apply on my face with fingertips from there.  Will keep it from being bumped or accidently wiped off and is a foundation makeup artist trick I have learned.
I am almost 58 and work daily in the outdoors at our horse farm.  I have had too much exposure to the sun through the years but I am watching out now for my skin as I age. I am such a lucky person to have received a chance to try this formula on my skin.  I know now that it is worth the price.  While price is nothing to sneeze at, it is still more affordable than many questionable products sold at large dept stores like Macys, Dillards, Neiman, etc. or that friend with that satchel of fancy marketed products you've been avoiding.",1522886400,2018-04-05

Amazingly, it does work great, which says a lot because I usually have tough skin (combination and sensitive.)  This moisturized my skin great without feeling oily or causing any breakouts. It has practically zero scent to it as well, which kind of annoyed me but if you like that, then this is a good option.  The quality of the ingredients is much better than the cheap stuff, that's for sure, and includes shea butter and avocado.

My reason for taking off a star is that it's FIVE TIMES or more the price of my Oil of Olay daytime cream. Hard to swallow that price tag. If you find other lower quality creams are not working out so well for you, then MAYBE this one would be worth it.  Just not for me.",1487289600,2017-02-17

3.0,"I've never actually used primer before and truthfully don't know it's full purpose. I started putting this on before my moisturizer but have not noticed much of a difference( was I supposed to?) It takes a little while to thoroughly rub into your skin but afterwards it does feel very light and not even noticeable. After I've finished with the moisturizer and a little bit of foundation I hardly notice I've put it on at all.

I like that the ingredients are all natural and it's fragrance-free which is very important for me as I hate harsh scents of any kind. For this price, I'm not sure if I will purchase once I run out of it, especially since I'm not really seeing a difference in my face after wearing it for a few weeks. I'm still optimistic though and will see how things progress.",1401840000,2014-06-04

It comes in five different shades: ivory, light beige, sand, golden beige, honey beige.

Well, Amazon Vine sent this foundation to me in a shade, 04 Honey Beige,  that is too dark for my skin, doesnt look good on me.  They can, of course, hardly be expected to know my skin tone.  The foundation does serve to minimize pores. But: this foundation turns a distinct orange color on my face, and, aside from the current American president, few people want orange skin. Perhaps a more suitable shade might not do this; Ive no way of knowing.  Meanwhile, I agree with other reviewers that youve only got to look at the foundation cross-eyed to get blank spots, holidays, my dad used to call them.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19

5.0,"I used to think buying a wig was my only alternative as a female with alopecia. I started with one little thin spot 20 years ago. Now the entire top of my head is extremely sparse or bald. Nothing worked for me before this. My only problem was that the dark brown was too dark, and the med brown too light. I found out you could pry/twist off the top of the regular size container or larger, and then you could mix colors to get the exact right match.
I attach the sprayer, cover my head in a fine mist, pat, comb. I continue to apply where needed and then spray with the fiber fix (or hairspray, if in a pinch, works fine). My hair is shiny and I am ready to face the world without being embarrassed about my mostly bald head. I now look like I have hair where there is none, or very little.

If you were on the beach with no scissors or knife, you'd probably be up the creek without any sunscreen.

Aside from that, it seems like your typical (albeit pricey) sunscreen. Instructions advise you to put it on 15 minutes before exposure, and to reapply after swimming. At this price, I'm going to use it mostly for my face, and they advise you to squirt it into your hand for that. I like that it pretty much DOES squirt, because you aren't actually supposed to inhale the spray from the cans, which is usually inevitable with a heavy spray like Banana Boat. The fragrance is very light, and it rubs in well without leaving your skin feeling greasy.

My pediatrician advised us to use Blue Lizard, which makes you look like an albino but works super well, and this product has not convinced me to switch. However, Blue Lizard is not available as a spray, so if that's what you're looking for, La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light. will fit the bill.",1446249600,2015-10-31

I thought for sure this was going to leave my eyes super greasy and oily but I was wrong. I had no problems with this makeup remover.

I use this to remove my eyeliner, mascara, and eye shadow. It removed everything pretty quickly. I always hold the wet cotton pad up to my eye and let is sit for a few seconds before swiping everything off. I try to let the cleaner sink in and do its magic before I try to rub everything off and this worked really well. Better than my old remover in fact. I was pretty much in love from the second I got a whiff of the fragrance and the way it cleans just put it way over the top for me.

The thing that always gets me is the price of remover. I mean, dang. I don't use makeup a lot and I'm starting to understand why. I can't afford it.

I guess I really didn't have a ton lines so I wasn't sure if it was doing anything at first. I did look closley today and my eyes look pretty darn good! Plumped & moisturized w/few fine lines. The cream comes in a nice pump that I find easy to control as far as not pumping out too much. You only need a little bit. It is a nice light cream that sinks in well and is very moisturizing.

5.0,"Okay, so by now I've tried a whole range of Dermablend products - mostly good, some meh. But the cover crme is the best of the bunch and truly what I think of and what I want when I think of Dermablend - which is FULL coverage, anywhere, everywhere. If you can only get one product from their line, this is the one to get. If you want the product that made Dermablend its name, this is the product to get. Of course, first you have to match your skin tone. Keep it mind that your skin has different shades from part to part. The skin on my face is different from the skin on my leg or on my hand. You have to have at least two shades, if not three so you can blend to the perfect match to whatever area you want to cover.

I have medium tones of Southeast Asian ethnicity. My skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.

So with that in mind, I chose Yellow Beige Chroma 1 1/2 for my face. It has that yellow undertone that looks best with my skin.

With the jar of product comes a little spatula. Don't lose it!  Scrape a little product with the spatula and put it on the back of your hand. Don't put too much. I made the mistake of putting too much product out the first time and had to discard half of it when I didn't use it. A little truly goes a long way because this is really thick, hence the full coverage. So, just scrape less than what you think you might need. Let the product warm on your hand for a bit and then apply on the skin area in question. I use my index finger. It covers my really dark acne spots and pimples. If it was dark enough for my legs, I would have used it on them for a flawless look. It thoroughly conceals any imperfections. I apply some setting powder, let it set and then brush the excess off and then use a setting spray. It lasts ALL DAY.",1499558400,2017-07-09
5.0,"The Mario Badescu Moisture Magnet SPF 15 Lotion works effectively as a both a facial moisturizer and light sunscreen.  The lotion is very thick, but goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and doesn't feel heavy on the skin.  There is a light scent to it that definitely has a sunscreen smell to it, but it's very subdued so neither you, nor people around you, will smell the lotion on you.  The lotion slightly tinted pink, but the tint does not show up on the skin.  I have normal/dry skin, and found this moisturizer worked well for me during the day.  The dry flaky patches on my face haven't shown up during the day when wearing this product (I use a different moisturizer at night), and the added SPF, while low, works well at protecting my skin while I'm out and about.  Makeup isn't affected when using this moisturizer as a base, and I haven't had any issues with smudging or streaking when using with various makeup products.  This lotion leaves skin feeling and looking matte, and works well when using it by itself.  I have slightly sensitive skin, and I haven't had any issues with breakouts or irritation.

2.0,"This serum is very oily. Too oily for a serum. It's very slick on the skin and goes on more like a layer rather than absorbing right in. It takes quite a while for it to absorb, and actually, I don't feel like it ever fully absorbs no matter how lightly a I apply it. My skin feels oily and slick until I wash it off... such as if I apply it in the morning, it'll stay greasy feeling all the way into the evening/night unless I wash my face sooner than that.

I don't have many wrinkles aside from a few tiny ones at the corner of my eyes, but I didn't see any improvement in those. I didn't think my skin looked better or worse in general, except for the fact that using this serum made me break out in tiny pimples on my upper lip.

Two to three sprays is enough for a nice projection.  People nearby will catch a light whiff when standing within  a couple feet or closer to the wearer.  Thankfully, it's not one of those overwhelmingly strong scents that would make your eyes water from across the room. I love this fragrance on my wife.

3.0,"I was excited to try this product because I have purchased other products from skyn ICELAND and been very satisfied.

When opening the packaging, I was happily surprised with the metal applicator, because it really feels cold and helps to refresh and de-puff the under-eye area. I like to use it without squeezing out any product, and just gently press along the puffy areas. The product itself is good, but leaves a few things to be desired.

First, the formula is smooth and gel-like upon application, but dries down completely. So much so, that I felt I had to remove it before applying concealer. This can be a ""pro"", because it seems like it sucks the puffiness out of the under-eye bag, giving it an almost tight feeling. So, it did deflate my puffy, tired, morning bags. But the ""con"" to it drying down so well is that it leaves the area, well, kind of dry--with a light film. I feel these problems can be lessened by using less of the product. It seems the other reviewers have also said that ""a little dab will do ya"". Take that advice seriously and the results are much better.

In terms of illumination, I did find that it was illuminating, but in a very, very natural way. I didn't think it was obvious at all. It doesn't add anything in terms of actual coverage, so I wouldn't get by using this alone.

I also want to mention that this is no eye cream, and doesn't claim to be. I expected it to be somewhat moisturizing because most under-eye products are, but it won't replace your moisturizer by any means. As I said above, it is actually slightly drying (and I have oily skin). If you have very dry skin and dry under-eyes, I wouldn't buy this. I will continue to use this over eye cream, and only the smallest amount. If you actually apply it from the applicator, you'll likely use too much. I will continue to use this but just squeeze a very small amount out and tap it under my eyes with my fingers, then go over it in a pressing motion with the metal tip.",1477612800,2016-10-28
5.0,"Reading the experiences of other reviewers on Amazon is almost always helpful. So when I applied this product, I used a mitt and rubbed it in well. I also applied very little cream at a time, so I got a thin, smooth layer that did not sit on top of my skin. The tint in the self-tanner was helpful for getting an even application. I applied so little that it was dry in fifteen minutes  You also need to know that I have naturally dry skin that just drinks up creams and lotions. I also do a weekly glycolic acid peel in hopes of removing skin discolorations and stimulating collagen, so this tanner doesn't ever go onto unprepared skin. My results were great. The process did not take a long time (again, that dry, thirsty skin). There was no streaking AT ALL, which is new to me. And I love the scent. I have not been able to tolerate the smell of other self-tanners except Xen-Tan products. The tanning chemical, dihydroxyacetone, which is in every self-tanner I've ever used, has always produced an overwhelmingly nauseating smell on my skin, but not Xen-Tan products, even though they also contain it. On my blue-white skin, this Moroccan Tan Ultra produced a wonderful tan color . It seemed to me that the color was just a bit warmer and richer than the tan I got from a different Xen-Tan product (the Dark Lotion Absolute Luxe) a few weeks ago. So I later applied them side by side on a hidden part of my body and found this is true. I prefer the Moroccan Tan Ultra color but that may be because I have no natural warmth to my skin tone without a tan -- and I never allow my skin to tan in the sun any more. I consistently use sunscreen every day because I'm outdoors for hours every day. If you already have a warm skin color, you may prefer the Dark Lotion Absolute Luxe, but in either case it's interesting that Xen-Tan has developed the technology to create different tones, neither of which run toward the orange of older faux tanners. I highly recommend this product but for myself will use it sparingly given the expense. The 8 ounce tube goes a long way and it needs to at this price!",1445558400,2015-10-23

3.0,"For a $50 cream I expected something better. The box says the cream was tested for sensitive skin, but there is no way this product is a sensitive skin-friendly. It is not extremely irritating, but after just a couple of uses I noticed the familiar itchiness. I am pretty sure I won't be using it again as I expect a few more uses will deliver enough chemicals into my skin for a full breakout.

Sad. I wanted to like it. Looks very luxurious and candy.",1454025600,2016-01-29

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29
4.0,"The La Roche-Posay Respectissime Soft Eyeliner Pencil for Sensitive Eyes works fairly well.

I found this eyeliner to apply smoothly without the need to go over any one section multiple times. I applied this to both my upper and lower lash line before applying my mascara as recommended. The line I get is very smooth and not smudgy in any way.

When worn, I found it to fade after several hours. It took nothing but a quick redo to refreshen the look I desired to have. I feel this is best worn when it's dryer out and not when it's rainy all the time since this is not water-proof.

I had zero discomfort or dryness to my eyes after wearing for a long time. It has no smell that I can detect.

I like how easy it is to apply. The only issue I ran into was when I first received it and the huge pain it was to remove the packaging on the lid. Once this packing is removed the plastic top is easy off and on but not so easy that it will just come off if tossed in a makeup bag or purse.

I found the black color to be a true black which is exactly what I wanted. It was no problem to remove with my favorite makeup removing wipes.

I plan on wearing this more in the Summertime since I found it to wear off quicker and feel the damp season had something to do with that.",1514851200,2018-01-02

3.0,"The color was darker than I expected. I know it's hard to tell on the computer what a product will look like in person, but I thought this would be a lighter shade than it turned out to be (not what I expected a ""honey beige"" to be). I like that it is fragrance free. The product claims to be ""hydrating"", however I did not find that it did any difference in terms of hydration than my current foundation. I have very dry skin, so maybe it will work better for someone who is not starting out with dry skin to begin with. It's a small (1 fl oz) squeeze tube, that would be good for traveling, but it's pricey for a foundation.  I suggest that you take a look at the shades of this product in a store to see which one is right for you, then you can go back online to compare pricing.",1524614400,2018-04-25

This came with the product already out of the box and the cap off. It seem to have came out of the packaging during transit. It took a few pumps and then the product came out.

I have done a couple WTG passes and it's a closer shave than my Edwin Jagger DE89 (which is also an awesome tool) gives when I add XTG and ATG passes. With the 37c, you really need to be careful under your nose and around your upper lip. If you're not careful, you can get bit badly. I use Personna Red and Gillette 7 O'Clock (Green and Yellow) blades in this razor.

5.0,This is a tiny miracle bottle.  It contains salicylic acid which is a leader in skin care for blemishes.  It comes in a small bottle but a tiny drop lathers and goes a long way.  The smell is strong as if you can feel it working.  I think it is clearing my skin daily the more I use it.  RECOMMENDED.,1486080000,2017-02-03
3.0,"The clipper, nail file, and tweezers are a nice stainless steel. The slanted tweezers work well.  They grasp the hair and pull it from the root instead of just breaking it.  The nail file is wonderful.  One side is coarse and the other side is fine.  Both sides work extremely well to shape and seal nails.

The nail clipper, on the other hand, is a bit flimsy and hard to open.  It's also made of stainless steel, but it's so thin that its difficult to cut your nails. Unfortunately, the design is great but it falls short on functionality.  I find that it slips out of place.  I have long nails and I bent one of them when the nail clipper slipped out of position.  I won't be using it again.  I'll stick with my Trim nail clipper.

That said, under foundation it looks amazing The glitter effect fades and it just brightens the skin tone. My makeup looks fresh all day, which is a big deal for me since I usually have a bad case of shiny face by lunchtime. The pump dispenser is nice, and a tiny bit goes a long way.

I'd kill for a whole line of products that smell just like it. It will be good for dry and sensitive skin, even without the usual sort of granules (the bits of almond are to few and far between to do much) it seems to do some mild exfoliating without irritating.

All I seem to ever smell is black licorice when I spray this, which is cool at first but then starts to give me a Jagerbomb kind of headache. I bought the 1 oz bottle which is great to have in my perfume collection, but I don't spray this too often and would never buy it again.",1407628800,2014-08-10
1.0,"This hairspray reeks terribly of cheap cologne scent.  I don't think I'll be attracting any women with it either. It's terribly overpowering. So bad I had to actually jump back into the shower to wash it off. I only used two short sprays and it stunk up the entire bathroom.

I've had functionally bad hairspray but I would gladly use those over this one.  I would not use this hairspray under ANY condition given the unbearable scent. It would be such a huge turn off and I suspect it will most certainly irritate anyone within a whiff of.

I have never used a hairspray that smelled this strong, easily twice as strong as AXE body spray.",1477094400,2016-10-22
5.0,"I'm ""blessed"" with the combination of aging skin and acne, so I've become pretty fussy about my toners. I stay away from most of the regular drugstore selections, because they dry out my skin and some of them cause flaking and irritation. My go-to choices have been some of the MUAC line. I'm very happy to report that this Effaclar Clarifying Solution has found a place in my regular routine.

I've been using this regularly for a couple weeks now -- I felt I had to give it a good trial to make sure it wasn't going to irritate my skin or cause breakouts. It hasn't done either; in fact it's helped to clear my skin, which was in the midst of breaking out when I started using the Effaiclar. I actually use it to remove my (light) makeup at the end of the day. After a couple cotton pads of this stuff, my skin is clean and toned, and treated with salicylic acid (and some glycolic acid as well, a skin-renewing treatment I have used in my MUAC treatments with excellent success).

I can't conclude this review without mentioning one more thing I liked about this toner: The packaging. The look is very clean and medicinal, as you would expect from a high-end, unscented acne/aging treatment. It's all business, no foolin' around. And I love the dispenser top. It's such a small thing, but so many cosmetics have cutesy and/or annoying dispensers. This is a simple flip-top that dispenses in easy-to-control quantities, a drop at a time (unless you squeeze firmly). That's a helpful thing with a toner like this, which is both powerful and costly; you don't want to blorp out huge, wasteful quantities.

Overall, this is a very well-thought-out toner that's far higher quality than most of what you'll find on a typical drugstore shelf. Highly recommended as a brightener and anti-breakout treatment for folks like me, who are still suffering from acne even as our skin begins to show its age.",1457049600,2016-03-04

5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20

The jar is very tiny - it almost looks like a sample but since you only use a little this should last at least a month.

5.0,"I didn't expect much more than a typical mask or peel....but this stuff is terrific. It doesn't have an Apple or juice (as in citrus) scent, but it's light and appealing. The texture is like a thin pudding that you apply by smearing a thin layer over what you need it. I was worried about irritation because it does contain lemon juice and the warning says some tingling may occur, and to test a small area before using. Ok, well, I didn't do that.

The peel did dry out and wasn't tight....more like it firmed up and lost the shine (moisture), but I didn't get that horrible right mask feeling. It's pleasant.  I was worried because I have very dry skin and rosacea. The end result was great! I was really surprised! It rinsed off easily and I was left with smoother skin and no dryness or tightness. Very happy and impressed with this product.",1415491200,2014-11-09

For starters, definitely take the advice of cutting the pads in half... half a pad is plenty for face, neck and even chest.  I've been using this along with the serum and after 2 months have noticed significant improvement in the appearance of sun spots and the ability of my skin to resist irritation.  I've also noticed an unexpected reduction in blackheads, maybe due to this exfoliating my skin?  I also only use this product a night and that seems to be plenty.",1377129600,2013-08-22
4.0,"First, the packaging is great. Since this stuff is super precious, I appreciate the precision pump that puts out just the right amount. I'm pretty sparing, so I can usually get both eyes with one squirt. I am always concerned about getting every last drop of product out, so I'll have to see how that goes once the pump fails to provide.

Another great thing is that this doesn't have some of the crazy, scary ingredients that other similar products have and there is minimal fragrance. I'm hypersensitive to smells, so this makes the difference between usable and not.

I've been using this for a while now and while I can't really see any big difference in wrinkles/fine lines, I love the high level of moisture it provides without ever being heavy or looking greasy. Even days that I skip it, my sensitive eye skin feels soft and moisturized. With that said, I'm not entirely sure that it is worth the incredibly high price tag, but that's a decision I'll have to make at the end of the jar...I would definitely repurchase if I can find a decent sale though.",1427414400,2015-03-27
4.0,"There is a catch 22 with this C-Serum.  It is different than what I am used to.  The first ingredient is Propylene Glycol, which is a form of mineral oil.  The other C-serums I have used in the past had water or aloe as the first ingredient and those provide a completely different feel than this one does.  This one gives the impression of being oily during application. Concerned, I went in search of information on this and discovered that Propylene Glycol helps the vitamin c penetrate further into your skin.  However, my initial concern abated when it absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling very soft.  It didn't result in any breakout nor did I experience any irritation (I have been using Vitamin C for years).  I expected somewhat of a sting but got none, which is also unlike most of the serums I have used in the past.  I would recommend this for women with dryer skin.",1485129600,2017-01-23

5.0,"I have always thought the decanter holding the precious liquid was pretty but I was unprepared how gorgeous and mesmerizing this scent was going to be. From the moment I rubbed the tester from a magazine my nose was in love. Five minutes later I ordered a big bottle off the internet and it arrived a few days ago, and I still cannot part with the scent. I even spray it on to go to bed, the sheer fact how warm and softly scented my sheets are in the morning makes it hard to get up to work. This scent melts into the skin, the musky crme brulee base is topped with juicy crimson watermelon, glowing mandarin, apples, fresh aquatic hyacinth, royal smelling lily and precious woods that give it a soft and spun like quality to the scent. I often find myself inhaling the aroma through the day, catching whiffs of my warm body and they escape up and away.

This fragrance is truly delectable with a softly scented melange of fruit and musky vanillas that really smells delicious and not like a fruit cake that so often is the result of perfumers going on a sugar coated overload. The scent is almost an aphrodisiac, a meteor shower raining down the inky sky with fluorescent flavors. This is my favorite new fragrance along with Estee Lauder's Beyond Paradise and I wear it from morning after my shower until the stars spear the sky and I lull myself to sleep. It's breathtakingly beautiful and so fragrant that my nose might never get over it, no wonder this perfume is so hard to find!

I can't say that it made my hair more shiny or manageable than any of the drugstore shampoos I normally use (I normally rotate Pantene with Avalon Organics). It didn't strip my hair, it didn't weigh it down, it didn't cause dandruff, it smelled terrific. The mint provides a nice, brief tingle, which is great during summer months. However, for less than half the price, I get the same results from drugstore shampoos, so I can't really justify using this again.",1442966400,2015-09-23

4.0,"I have had mixed reactions to the StrivectinLABS Extreme Cream. It is very nicely packaged, and has a very light lemony fragrance. The cream itself feels silky and smooth. It spreads on evenly, and absorbs quickly.

I used this on my face, neck and upper chest, as I do every other cream I have ever used. This was at night, before bed. When I woke the next morning, I glanced at my reflection as I entered my bathroom, and I noticed my face looked a little red. I thought I needed coffee! No, seriously, I thought it was from sleeping. About half an hour later, when I went to take a shower, my face was still red, like a light sunburn. Then I saw my neck, and my chest. Guys, I was lobster red. Like first-sun-exposure-of-the-year red. 5 days later, after multiple showers, I am still red. And now it itches.

To give the cream credit, though, all of the wrinkles on my chest were gone. Not on my face, though. Still have laugh lines, and those lovely grooves at the side of the mouth.

I have used the cream lightly on my face for the last 5 days. I still have a light reddishness on my face, but nothing like my chest, and no itching. At this point, I think I am going to discontinue use, because I am not seeing any real effect on my face, and I am kind of afraid my face is going to eventually do the same thing my chest did.

Bottom line - The pluses of the product do not outweigh the negative for me. I would recommend trying a sample of the product on a small inconspicuous area to see if you have a reaction, as at least one other review I read mentions getting a rash.

About a week ago, I had run out of my regular moisturizer, and the StriVectin was all I had on hand. I decided to try it again, using sparing amounts. So for the last 6 days, I have done this. My skin looks different. The laugh lines are starting to fade, which thrills me. On the negative side, I have about 5 small red spots, maybe 2cm in diameter, on different areas of my face. Not sure the two are connected, as I have been noticing some skin discoloration before using the StriVectin. Anyway, my makeup seems to be applying more smoothly, and the skin on my face is soft and supple. I will continue use, and update this review as warranted.",1415491200,2014-11-09

5.0,"My wife is much more expressive than I am so she tends to form lines on her forehead when she's feeling extreme stress. As a teacher she has been under more stress lately with the year ending and everything wrapping up.

She started using Dr. Brandt's Needles No More and instantly saw a result on her forehead the next morning. The lines were already very faint but she's already seeing results there that show they've gone down considerably. She mentioned that continued use has caused her lines to become fainter and her skin feels smoother. She loves the product and thinks it's one of the few beauty products she'll subscribe to keep buying despite its large cost.

Finish looks like skin, it is smooth and slightly glowy but not at all oily. It doesnt accentuate lines, pores or peach fuzz. You don't have to set it.

4.0,"H2O plus water bright Illuminating night cream is gentle and clean, delivering well rounded moisture to my face and neck It is  fully absorbed by my skin without leaving it dry even after several hours or after skin exposure to dry, windy weather. I have tried several creams, toners and oils to help help brighten and even out my skin tone  as well as eliminate dark spots and I have found that this cream does a better job than many others. I particularly like its non greasy feel, that although most moisturizers with similar price tags promise they many times do not deliver. I also am pleased with its sweet aroma, as it is not overpowering or intoxicating, and seems to be delivered by its natural ingredients of snowflake flower and pomelo extracts. I would recommend it as a standard nightly moisturizer as it shows noticeable results within weeks' time even without the commended usage of the same brand's day serum. The only drawback that I found was in the design of the container as I found myself taking off the pump and the lid at the same time because  they seem to stick to each other and are not easily distinguishable.",1479081600,2016-11-14
5.0,This makeup goes on very smoothly and a little goes a long ways.  It covers evenly and should hide blemishes and tattoos.  I wrote on the back of my hand with a black Sharpie and was completely hidden by the cover creme.

If you apply it at points where your clothing comes into contact with it your clothing will get stained since it's not permanent.  It is a beautiful chocolate brown color tone.,1499212800,2017-07-05

It has a nice moisturizing balm feel to it and you don't see the tint or any color once you put it on, though in the tube it looks like a dark tan. It doesn't have a ton of sheen, so I can use it above my top lip where I have melasma and it doesn't get all shiny or greasy. I just tap or rub it in a little in that area and it's just as good as using a regular sunscreen there. It's not as dry or matte as most of the other sunscreen balms I've used and that's one of the reasons I like it so much. It actually softens and moisturizes your lips while using it. It is light and smooth and gets the job done perfectly. Sort of amazing with such a great spf level.",1504656000,2017-09-06

4.0,"This is a good product for what it is. I don't normally use a setting spray for street (everyday) makeup but it does hold your look very well. The spray isn't sticky, dries quickly, and isn't irritating to the skin. It held my eye makeup even better than I expected. I didn't have eyeshadow in the creases like I normally do after 8 hours of wear. And the scent was pleasant and faded quickly.

I think the bottle itself could use a little redesign though. I think it sprays too wide. It got into my hair and on my shirt just from a quick spray directed at the middle of my face. I think it would benefit from a slightly smaller spread.

Other than that, it works very well. I will keep it to use for special occasion makeup and when I do stage makeup.",1415750400,2014-11-12

This does seem to be far more expensive than some very similar products that are creamy and remove makeup without drying your skin.  I haven't experienced any break outs or irritation, which is a plus.  It is creamy during use, rinses completely and leaves my skin feeling soft without an oily residue.

5.0,"I just finished using my first bottle of dr brandt's LaserFX Perfect Serum, and I have to admit, this serum is really great stuff.
Over the weeks that I used Laser FX, initially my skin began to feel smoother and look brighter/healthier, then I found the little lines around my eyes diminishing, and finally my ""squint"" line started to go away. I also noticed overall a more even complexion. My skin feels younger - very smooth, soft, and supple - like it did 10 years ago. I'm not quite sure how to describe it ... for me, my skin was firmer and yet at the same time it feels smoother. The feeling of my skin as well as the look is definitely improved after using this product for almost 4 weeks.

Knowing that only 20% of the aging process in my skin is biological, it made sense to me that you can influence the aging process with how I treat and protect my skin. With 80% of the aging process coming from the environment, using products to protect and care for my skin has become a priority for me as I age. Ive also talked to our daughters about how they care for their skin, and even though they're both young, they are subject to everyday stresses and aren't always in the most beneficial environment for their skin - sun, swimming, or around smoke. I know the natural biological defenses in our skin breaks down with aging, and thats where the biologically engineered skin care products come into play - they enhance and support the biological defenses..

There are a lot of ingredients in Laser FX, but the primary 3 are:
1. Heptapeptides  - peptide are forms of proteins and have many benefits. There are many different types of peptides and all have various functions. Peptides deliver the proteins to the undermost layer of the skins ability to increase the collagen.
2. Biomimetic Peptides - One of the reason aging skin becomes less firm and loses elasticity and the ability to bounce back is because the dermis and epidermis lose the ability to function well together. Biomimetic Peptides help the skin by replicating the function of more youthful skin, enabling it to regain some of its ability to produce collagen and stave off the visible signs of aging - wrinkles, skin tone, and sagging.

3. This ingredient was of particular interest to me. Im really into Ayurvedic herbs, and Centella Asiatica, better known as Gotu Kola, and also Indian Pennywort, has been used in the Orient, as well as in India for thousands of years, and is listed in Indias ancient medical text.  Centella Asiatica has skin enhancing properties when used topically in the form of ointments - including helping with eczema, leprosy, lupus, varicose ulcers, eczema, and psoriasis. It has good skin healing properties, and decreases the inflammatory response when used topically, as well as taken internally, and comes in tablet, capsule, tincture, extract, and tea form. It  is used to fight the oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Oxidative stress contributes to aging in general and various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. There has been a great deal of interest in this herb in recent years, and many studies done on its beneficial uses - particularly in the West as a neuroprotectant.

The effect of Centella Asiatica for cosmetic is the calming anti inflammatory effect of this herb - it has been considered the best home remedy for skin disorders such as chronic ulcers and persistent eczema. Centella Asiatica has incredible tonifying properties for the entire body. Its just one more medicinal herb thats been used in Asian and Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years, and fortunately allopathic medicine is coming around, and finally doing research to prove the benefits of these herbs and herbal formuls. Gotu Kola was one I hadnt read up on too much, and thankfully it came up as the third primary ingredient in dr brandt Laser FX Perfect Serum.

Application of the product is specific - as I found out with another product, not dr brandt, but  they recommend applying it in a particular manner - it was an expensive neck cream. I didn't find out how I was supposed to apply it until I was more than  done with the cream. I checked the website for dr brandt and it also recommends applying it in a particular manner - which I did. I don't know if that helped or not, but I did get a good effect.

There are three serums in the Dr. Brandt Laser FX Series: Lift, Perfect, and Bright. Each serum is designed to target a different skin care concern. I only tried the Perfect, but at some point Id like to try them together because I have a feeling they're synergistic - working together for the best effect on the skin. At $78 it is pricey, but I don't think you'll get the same effects from a drug store brand.

I would definitely recommend dr brandt Laser FX Perfect Serum for those concerned with skin beginning to show the signs of aging.",1426118400,2015-03-12
4.0,"I've been using this product for almost two weeks at both night and morning, and I believe that it's a solid option for a daily use serum.

This may be a reaction to my toner or cleanser, though.  I've tried similar, more expensive products that work better, quite honestly.

5.0,"Recently I started applying oils to mu skin.  I started off with the face and I am not expanding on moisturizing neck and chest area.  I really like this trio.  It comes in a small attractive packaging and it has three options: nourishing oil, smoothing oil and lifting oil.  I am applying lifting oil to my neck, nourishing oil around the eyes and lips are and smoothing oil to the rest of my face.  I recently purchased on Amazon sonic facial cleanser.  So my skin routine for the extended weekend ritual included cleansing the skin with sonic cleanser, toning it with facial toner, and then applying oils for extended moisturizing effect.  I like to leave this oil overnight on my skin and I have noticed that my skin is visibly softer to the touch and yet firm.

Really nice product that can be applied to any skin type.  The other nice thing about the product is that it is non-greasy.  It absorbs quickly so if you sleep with it, it will not mess up your pillow cases.  Although bottles may look too small, only a small amount of product is needed for application.  I believe that this product will enhance anyone's skin, regardless of the age.  Also it is suitable for both men and women.",1465948800,2016-06-15

I used the tiniest dab I could and spread it evenly through my damp hair, then blew it out like always and wow! I never knew my hair could look this good. My hair has shine like never before. It holds a soft wave. Every drop of frizz is gone and that's a miracle because I have very damaged dry sun baked hair. My hair is now perfection.

I can't even feel this on my hands after rubbing it on them to style my hair. It has zero scent. I used a dab half the size of a pea, so this should last for a year. The only con to this is that it didn't come in a box and has no ingredient list. I like to know what chemicals I'm using on my hair and skin. But the results are better with this than anything I've yet to use and that's quite a statement coming from an absolute product junkie.

What really impresses me the most about this is the way my hair doesn't get greasy from it.  I went for two days without washing my hair after I used this and my hair never felt greasy or weighted down.  The only way I could tell something was in it was the way it stayed smooth and shiny and controlled.

This is a gentle hold that smooths and shines. It's for men but women can use it too. It won't replace a super hold gel. But this is perfection for my needs.",1393977600,2014-03-05

5.0,"I first tried this foundation on a day that was extremely humid and 94 degrees Fahrenheit.  Heat index was 104.  The product worked great, working more like my own skin, than a coverage on it. It is very lightweight and applies smoothly and effortlessly.  I got ""Buff"", and was surprised to see that it matched my skin tone perfectly (more on the color later).

I sprayed on my usual toner with witch hazel; let that dry, while I gave this foundation a good shake-up (holding down the button on top to allow all the foundation to re-mix).  The lid unscrews and releasing the button on top sucks foundation up into the dropper.  The foundation applies a little lighter than what you would expect, but the ""whiteness"" disappeared while I was lightly blending it in.

Hot and humid as it was that day (still is....) that I almost decided to not ride my bike around the campground.  But I did.  And it was a great trial for this foundation from Bliss.  It allowed my skin to breathe normally.  Sweat did not ooze or hover underneath the coverage.  Felt like I was not wearing anything.  Sweat dripping down my face did not sting my eyes.

Is the SPF 20 strong enough?  For me, yes.  I tan easily and very seldom burn--haven't burned in years and years because I usually wear something that has SPF 20 in it.

How does the color compare with what I've been using?  My usual foundation are two Bare Minerals products:  Bareskin (lighter weight for summertime and SPF 20) and Complexion Rescue (a bit richer for the colder, drier months and SPF 30).  This ""Buff"" color of this Bliss product compares nicely to the Bareskin Bare Natural 07 and the Complexion Rescue Suede 04.  This Bliss Buff color is a very nice balance of tint:  Not too much orange, not too much yellow, not too much pink.  I can't do too much orange, yellow or pink pigment.  Buff works well for me.

The color shown on the product page is very much the way it actually is.",1467590400,2016-07-04

At night after washing my face with Image ageless I apply Image Retinol and a thin layer of this over it and the results are amazing. My complexion in the morning is better my face has a natural bright color .I don't wear anything but lipstick and mascara. I don't feel I need it and I'm in my 40s. This combination works wonders for me and leaves my face smooth. I much rather save money by buying here than at any spa .This I have no doubt it is Authentic.

It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

But no, it looks great on me, too, very subtle.  I would say it adds a bit of luminosity rather than shimmer, just brightens up the face.  The color is very natural looking and even though I use about half as much as I would my regular blush, it goes on smoothly, super easy to apply, and stays on well.

Viva La Juicy Gold Couture has a vanilla-caramel scent.  I don't get much honeysuckle, amber, or wild berry, but this could be giving the fragrance just enough complexity that I'm not overwhelmed by the sweetness.

I find that a couple of light spritzes will get me going in the morning.  I don't like a fragrance that announces me or that remains in a room after I leave.  Viva La Juicy Gold Couture stays close, so only those who get near will know I'm wearing it.

I used a sponge to apply this and blend it for a nice even coverage, you could use your fingers, however if you are prone to breakouts or skin irritations then a sponge seems a better option for less oil and dirt.

5.0,"All Hail the Queen was my first bottle of polish by Butter London. Tired of thin polishes from Essie and not really excited by OPI at the moment, I finally decided to give this brand a try. I've purchased a bottle of Chanel polish before, but $15 for nail color still seems steep to me. I picked this color because it seemed safe lol and I just wanted to try the product line.

I really do like the color. Having brown skin it's not exactly nude but a nice neutral color with a hint of sparkle to break up the monotony. The application reminded me a lot of the Chanel bottle I have. Not just the removable top cover, but the fact that it brushes on neatly. You won't end up with too much on the brush, minimizing clean up and product waste.

The color itself is nice and with a top coat it reminds me a little of those old Sally Hansen prism polishes, minus the color change effect. I do like the texture of the polish and it's wearable with or without a topcoat. This color can also be worn well at one or two coats. The drying time was fast, but I can't speak too much for the longevity yet. I see complaints about chipping polish, which may be solved by making sure your nails are smooth, well buffed and totally clean of all oils. After a day of wear, shampooing my hair etc my polish was still intact, at least. (I used Out the Door topcoat)

I'm not saying I'm a Butter London fan just yet lol, but I did like this polish enough to order a second color. When I saw my polish outdoors the next day, I ordered 3 more bottles of Butter London polish from Amazon lol. While I'm sure other companies out there make a color comparable to this one, I'm happy I finally gave this brand a try.",1386201600,2013-12-05

5.0,"This review will be from a makeup artist's perspective.  I have had the opportunity to use MANY gel liners and I have learned to use them for a variety of purposes in makeup.  I plan to update this review with photos if I am able to, but for now, a brief summary is how I am going to start.

WHAT IS THIS PRODUCT LIKE?
If you are used to using other gel liners like Buxom or MAC Fluidline, for example, this gel liner might be a challenge for you.  It is a brilliant bronze gold color and the consistency is very mousse like.  It is so light that it can be a challenge to apply well.  The particles are glittery, but when put in a line you don't see them.

HOW TO BEST APPLY THIS PRODUCT
For this liner you are going to need a liner brush that is densely packed and quite stiff with just a little give to it.  You are best to dip the brush into the gel liner and then work the product evenly into the bristles and THEN apply a line.  Test it on your hand first until you get the hang of it.  I prefer to use a slanted brush with this, but I also have a densely packed liner brush which is not an angled brush and that applies well too.

HOW WELL DOES IT WEAR
I have found that if applied well the first time (working the product into the bristles evenly) that this will stay in place all day on lids that are not excessively oily.  I have only had to apply once and it is fine for the day, especially if set with powder or shadow on top.

ANOTHER USE
If you use a good eye cream which soaks into the lid quickly and well, you can apply to your lid, then use a synthetic flat brush with rounded tip.  It is designed for cream eyeshadow.  You can quickly apply to the lids as an eyeshadow as well and when the cream has set, so will the shadow and stay in place all day long.  The cream on the lid gives you time to work, and gives that ability to do a wash effect and not look patchy.

THE BOTTOM LINE
This is a bit of a tricky gel liner to use, but once you get the hang of it, it is beautiful metallic liner.  It stays in place all day.  If you are careful to follow a few steps you can also use this as an eyeshadow on the lids.  A little goes a long way.  If you keep this covered at all times even while using, it will last quite some time.

FIVE STARS for now.  I will update as I have more experience with it should the information contribute to the overall evaluation of the product. I also plan to add a photo or two if I am able to as well.",1482796800,2016-12-27

4.0,"Skin feel: This moisturizer feels cool and pleasant on the skin.

Smell: When I first put this on, the smell seems refreshing, but it is a lasting fragrance that is slightly strong for my tastes. If you want an idea of how this smells on the skin, it is similar to the Watkins brand green tea and aloe scented line of products.

Composition and effectiveness: Many of the ingredients are organic and nature-based, which is a big selling point for me compared to many of the drugstore and department store products. The ingredients include antioxidants that should help prevent signs of aging. Experiences are very subjective, but I will try to update this as I use this product over time.

Conclusion: This is a moisturizer that is a little heavy for a day cream, but works well at night. The fragrance is a little strong and lasting. The inclusion of organic ingredients and antioxidants is a major selling point, in my opinion.",1415232000,2014-11-06

While it does go on white it quickly rubs clearly into the skin with no tint or color. There is no scent, and it did not irritate my face nor my eight year old son's face. You need very little so the small bottle will last a while. This is so light on the skin I do see how you could put your makeup over this product. The best factor I found about this sunscreen is that since it is light it absorbs very quickly and you can get in the pool and it indeed seemed very waterproof as it never ran into my eyes and I did not burn. This is very expensive but it works so well I would highly recommend this sunscreen.",1501891200,2017-08-05
4.0,"Ok- I'm gonna ""tell it like it is""

I think Jack black is a good line, but not a GREAT line, and is overpriced in general.

My personal skin care regimen:
1. Billy Jealousy shave cream- cheaper than jack black and in my opinion better
2. Billy jealousy shaved ice after shave healer- the jack black is pretty good too, but I like the billy jealousy better.
3. Jack Black facial moisturizer- I do like this product a lot
4. I used the protein booster skin serum- saw no real difference, and for as much as it costs, you could find better options.
5. I do like the jack black eye serum.

In general, Jack black is considered more of an ""anti-aging"" line, hence the higher price point.

I am not saying their products are bad in any way, I just think there are better products out there for the money.
One line I'm going to look into is the ""menscience"" line of products.

This toner has number 2 because toner is always used after cleanser.  This toner comes in a generous 6.7oz size.  It is enclosed in a sturdy white plastic bottle and well protected from sun rays so it can last for a long tine.  I use this toner daily in the morning and in the evening after cleansing the skin and before applying skin serum.  I apply toner on a cotton pad to apply it on my skin.  Toner is light blue color.  Ingredients are very soothing for any skin type: purified water, witch hazel water, aloe vera leaf juice, panthenol (vitamin B  which has healing benefits), allantoin (vitamin A), glycerin (great for softening the skin), sage leaf extract, borago extract, calendula flower extract (calming properties), fragrance (parfum).

It very common for scented products to give me a migraine but this one didn't.

5.0,"This Solid Setting Powder was used by a friend who has beautiful olive colored skin with minor imperfections in conjunction with Dermablend Cover Creme Foundation. She was attending an outside summer gathering in very warm conditions so was especially concerned her skin, which tends to be oily and prone to breakouts with some products, might appear shiny or makeup might run and need to be reapplied as the afternoon wore on. She had never tried a setting powder before and was surprised that though the product is white it went on completely invisibly. She applied it only once and buffed it with a makeup brush. She said it has an effect of seeming to absorb any oils without any caking and still felt weightless. This was a free product in exchange for a fair and honest review, but she reported that she will definitely now include it in her normal daily makeup routine and will purchase it when this sample supply is exhausted.",1503360000,2017-08-22

4.0,"'Fragrant Water' is a misleading label. I assumed it was basically a fancy name for 'body spray', which is probably fairly accurate, but it's much stronger than I'd expect. I normally get my body sprays from places like Bath & Body Works, and am used to using multiple sprays to get a strong, pleasant scent that fades quickly. This fragrant water requires 1 spray and lasts at least 5x longer (I have not done any scientific testing here, so I error on the side of caution in this estimate).
I like the scent well enough. It has a very perfumy smell, i.e. it smells nice, but I can not identify any real smells in it. I wish they offered it in different scents. It comes in a nice bottle (I really liked the lid).
I would call this a perfume rather than 'fragrant water'.",1467072000,2016-06-28

3.0,"It is hard to find the shade/s that match and complement your skin.  What is especially tricky is figuring out now the rosy-undertones (or yellow-undertones) affect how, ultimately, a particular shade looks on one's skin.  I wound up having to blend too different shades, which I don't view as a viable path forward.

The good quality of this make-up really is off-set by the quirkiness of the shades.",1498435200,2017-06-26
5.0,"I am always thrilled to find a high quality beauty product that is paraben free. And this is the only one I have run across that is formulated for POST menopausal women.  I also love the texture of the cream--silky. As to some of the other youth-i-fy-ing claims, I'm never that convinced with any product. It is certainly as good--and may over time be better--than many I've tried at a higher price.

I should mention that the packaging is nice. It has a subtle feminine aura punctuated with a little shine, a little luxury. I'm not sure, but I think that kind of thing could add to the placebo affect. If nothing more, it looks nice on my makeup counter when I forget to put it back in my makeup drawer.",1460160000,2016-04-09
5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17
5.0,"This stuff is amazing. There's no other word for it. I purchased this because my skin has been completely going off the rails lately and my chin has been breaking out yet has been extremely dry, flaky, and has been peeling and irritated, almost like its chapped. It's been quite painful and I've used every oil, every moisturizer with healing/calming benefits I can get my hands on and nothing has worked to moisturize and calm my skin until this.

This spray smells amazing. It smells just like fresh roses. It is not oily or greasy, yet my skin drinks it in and has become softer, less irritated and the peeling and flakiness have completely subsided. My breakouts are reduced by half and are no longer painful and red. My skin is really starting to normalize and it's only been a day and a half! Everything I've used on my skin lately has stung except for this spray. I can't even begin to explain the relief I've experienced since my first spray.

This spray does not make your skin feel taught or dry after it dries like some setting/facial mists I have tried in the past. It leaves your skin plump, moisturized and comfortable.

I can't wait to continue using this spray and see what effects it continues to have on my skin and how it works with makeup. I haven't been able to wear makeup in the last few weeks because of my skin issue, and I'm going to wait a few more days to attempt it, but I'm anticipating a lot of good things.

This spray says once you try it you won't want to be without it...well, that couldn't be more accurate. This spray is one of the best skincare products I have found in recent memory and definitely worth the time and investment. Couldn't be happier and neither could me skin.",1476057600,2016-10-10
4.0,"Good product, easy to apply, has great coverage. It goes on smooth and can be applied multiple times to get desired coverage. Product is a bit thick but doesn't feel heavy or cause fine lines and wrinkles to stand out more. I like the fact that the applicator sponge has a separate compartment away from the product. Small and compact, easy to carry around in a small purse or bag. I finished it off with a loose powder and was happy with the results.

2.0,"The ultimate test for any facial cleanser I use is - will it remove my waterproof eye makeup fairly easily and without too much rubbing? Unfortunately, this water facial cleanser did not pass that particular test. I applied on a cotton pad as directed and tried to wipe off my waterproof eye makeup.  It took three minutes of too-vigorous rubbing to get it to completely come off.

However, if you don't have waterproof makeup then this gentle cleanser might be for you. My skin did not react negatively to it after a couple weeks of use.  There is no smell, no dye. It feels and looks ...like water.

Even with just regular makeup, however, I felt that I need a more substantial cleanser than ""water"" because my skin still felt dirty. I would use another regular cleanser after this and indeed picked up quite a bit of makeup on my washcloth.",1477526400,2016-10-27
5.0,"I wash my hair everyday and it was suggested to me by stylist that I give this a try.

I am using other Oribe products also such as Shampoo Conditioner and sprays etc I love them This has been good so far has not weighed  my hair down and I have noticed it has helped my hair not to be so dry .

2.0,"A little goes a long way, but how it ends up is the issue. The feeling is Very greasy and heavy, and my pores looked and felt very clogged with this. It cannot be used alone without looking rather strange. It covers pretty well, which means that you have to add back shading to look like a real person instead of a plastic toy. When you add powder (I used this same brand to try and follow suggested use), it gets rather muddy and cakey, looking very thick.

I took it off after a very short while because of how yucky it felt. I didn't care for this product, but in good news, it does help block sun.",1499558400,2017-07-09
5.0,"It's a very pretty color, and it has smooth application.  I put 3 very thin coats on and my nails look flawless.  In sunlight, the silver shimmer is very beautiful, but still subtle.  It's a very summery feminine polish. The color looks like a shimmery less pastel version of Coral Reef by Sally Hansen.  I painted my nails with Sunday Funday last night and they haven't chipped 24 hours later.  Usually I chip polishes fast because my nails are in awful condition from school, work, guitar, and piano.  But it's held up so far with a top coat.  Definitely in my top 5 favorite polishes out of the 50-something I have.

On a side note, the polish arrived very fast, a day before the shipment stated.  The polish was properly wrapped in bubble wrap and then put into paper packaging that was encased with bubble wrap as well.",1374710400,2013-07-25

I've switched to using it at night before bed, but I actually still prefer my Solar Oil, which sinks in right away.

3.0,"This peel comes in 2 tubes, both 50 ml/1.7 oz (so it is a fairly large size with sufficient product to use for months).  The directions said 1-2 times per week.  My wife gets monthly facials, and uses retinol and Hydroquinone skin bleaching creams (she is 52 and has age spots due to sun damage), so her skin is used to harsh peeling agents.  This product requires application of Step 1, the detoxifying primer (a thick cream) that you leave on for one minute, and then Step 2, the AHA Activator (glycolic and other AHA acids to slough away dead skin cells), which is a gel that you leave on between 3-5 minutes.  The product carefully warns users to never use either Step 1 or Step 2 alone - always together.  My wife followed the directions carefully.  It is easy to apply, although time consuming.  She left it on for 5 full minutes (in light of her skin that is used to peels), and  - Nothing.  No tingling.  No exfoliation.  Nothing.  It has a pleasant odor, and feels fine on the skin, but in the end my wife did not notice any difference.  For a product this expensive, you would hope for something; however, I acknowledge that my wife does a lot of peels that are medical grade, and perhaps if you don't do that your skin would be more susceptible to this peel.",1428192000,2015-04-05

4.0,"I have been a fan of this product line for awhile, problem being is that the American version is not nearly as good as the European version. I don't know why this would matter but I'm guessing that inferior ingrediants are used in the US whereas the EU version has higher quality ingrediants.

This doesnt mean it doesn't work, just not as well. Since I've recently spent a lot time in Europe and have all these same products in the EU version and have been using them for a long time, I know I like them.

The facewash is very cleansing and not drying, the clarifying solution is gentle yet cleans off any residual makeup and then my favorite is the dual action treatment -- a daily staple. Using this system along with some Juice Beauty products has really calmed my stress-related breakouts! Give it a shot, you might be surprised!",1445472000,2015-10-22

I spray it on after washing my face and let it dry on its own. After about a week, my skin tone seemed more even, less splotchy, and less dry.

4.0,"I haven't seen a product like this before, so it's a little hard to compare to anything. Essentially it feels like very-slightly-thickened water, with some mild, pleasant fragrance and a faint blue tint. The application directions are a little vague, but you put it on your face after washing and before further steps, like moisturizing. I just use my hands, because I feel like a cotton ball would just absorb it all.

It definitely seems to smooth and hydrate. Moisturizer spreads more easily and seems to soak in better after using this.

Is that an important function? I'm not sure. But I do kind of like it, and Vichy has nice products overall. Worth a try, especially if you're in a dry climate, or have dry skin.",1484697600,2017-01-18

I have also recommended to my friends and family. Just a few days ago I had really dry skin all over my chin, cheeks, nose, and forehead. I tried everything I could think of with the products that I had already, and nothing was working. I decided to try this after a youtube blogger friend of my recommended it. It only took a couple days for my skin so look amazing. It think after using this my skin looks better than it did before.

5.0,"A few years ago I bought a lotion that used a ""milk"" fragrance in it. It was called milk and honey and was used as a soothing aroma to help one sleep. It wasn't a fragrance that I immediately loved. Instead it grew on me over time. I've had 2 or 3 lotions from various companies that use the ""milk"" fragrance to it, and they all have a few subtle similarities. This one by L'Occitane also has some of the same notes, but is definitely different than the milk lotions from other companies.

For one, the scent is stronger. Most lotions that say they are a ""milk"" fragrance, tend to be very subtle. You have to virtually hold your nose up to your skin to smell it. Not with L'Occitane's lotion. I put just a few dabs of it on my hands and while working at my desk, typing on my keyboard, I smell the lotion.

The L'Occitane version is sweeter than others. It's like milk mixed with something super sweet smelling, that I can't put my finger on. It's a clean yet sweet fragrance.

It comes packaged in a beautiful heavy glass jar with a silver-tone twisting lid on the top. Because the fragrance in the lotion is so concentrated, one jar will last a long time. It wears almost like a sweet perfume, because the scent lasts so long. And actually because of the strong scent, I prefer to wear it on the body more than my hands and arms.",1418169600,2014-12-10

5.0,"Per the wife: I have the NuFace Microcurrent device (both full size and mini). These products are incredible in toning your skin and have gotten rid of my jowls. I am 53 (soon to be 54) and have not had botox or surgery. I am always trying new facial devices and serums (and masks, etc.) looking for the best that is out there.  I get a facial every 6 weeks. I have been very impressed with the NuFace products. These serums are travel/sampler size, not the full product, and if you are expecting a full sized product, you will be very disappointed. Each is .25, whereas individually, these run around $85 for 1 oz.  These can be used individually or layers.  If you own a light therapy or microcurrent device (I own both) these are used to optimize your treatment. These go on easily and are quickly absorbed into the skin.
The Nourisher Superfruit Stem Cell Serum (promotes cell renewal) goes on first after washing and toning. It is an anti-inflammatory. You apply 4-5 drops on face and neck.  The ingredients are: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture (Apple Stem Cell), Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Algae Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Vitis Vinifera Fruit Cell Extract (Grape Stem Cells), Isomalt, Sodium Benzoate, Rhododendron Ferrugineum Leaf Cell Culture Extract (Alpine Rose Stem Cells), Lactic Acid, Phenoxyethanol , Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Pichia/Resveratrol Ferment Extract.  You will note that it says ""s1"" on the bottle - this tells you that it is the first to be applied.
The second serum is the Smoother Infusion Serum (1 fl oz) - Smooth fine lines & wrinkles with 6 powerful anti-aging peptides.  Peptides are the key to relaxing wrinkles and fine lines. This serum says ""s2"" on the bottle, so you know that it is applied second (following the superfruit). Again, apply 4-5 drops to the face and neck.  The ingredients are: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Polyglyceryl Methacrylate, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4 (Matrixyl), Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 (Argireline), Hydrolyzed Rice Bran Protein , Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein , Oxido Reductases (Regu-age), Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone , Steareth-20, Dipeptide-2, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7 (Eyeliss), Algae Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate (Syn-Ake), Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol , Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Pichia/Resveratrol Ferment Extract.  Note - no parabens or other harmful ingredients. It delivers instant wrinkle reduction results.
The third serum is the Lifter (life and hydration).  It says ""s3"" - so you know that it is applied third following serums 1 and 2. Lifter Serum Ingredients are:tWater (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitol, PEG-8/ SMDI Copolymer, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Dimethicone, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Zinc Sulfate, Sodium Hydroxide, Xanthan Gum, Pyridoxine Dipalmitate, Disodium EDTA, Ergothioneine, Allantoin.
These can be used individually or layered.
If you are using these with your microcurrent device, Cleanse the skin with an oil-free cleanser, then - Optional: Apply preferred NuFACE serum (so one of these three) by tapping into your skin with your fingertips. Then apply NuFACE Gel Primer in a mask-like layer to one area at a time, beginning with the left cheek. After using the device, you can finish by apply serum of your choice and follow your regular skincare routine.
I really love these serums. They are high quality ingredients and work great with the NuFace microcurrent device or alone as part of a regular skincare regime.
I plan to buy the full sized products, and also want to try the NuFace collagen booster.",1465084800,2016-06-05
4.0,"I am familiar with Bliss products both from our local spa and from using their great Body Butter. The Body Butter is the greatest for adding moisture to really dry skin, but not for getting rid of wrinkles, creases or crepiness. This Bliss fabgirl leave it to cleavage says you'll notice a difference in one day.

To see if there is a difference in only one day, I applied the cream on one half of my chest, up to the neck following their directions. The next morning, I did not see any difference, but I did feel a difference. My skin felt way smoother, silkier and tighter, but the creases were still there. So, I used it again every night and on the fourth night, when I went to apply the cream, there was a noticeable difference on the deepest creases.

I was very impressed that in only three applications, the deepest creases on my upper chest were actually less deep. Since then, I have applied it for a full week and I do see a visible difference in the really deep crease lines. They not only look less deep, but my skin feels silky smooth. I see no difference in any wrinkles or crepiness, only in the deep chest creases. The cream itself is silky light, not greasy with a slight perfume smell. I will be using this every night, as lessening deep creases is a huge nice improvement, but I have yet to find anything that helps get rid of the crepe skin in the upper chest /neck area, that I had been hoping for.",1463011200,2016-05-12

This is a little different then I imagined - comes out almost mousse like though not quite as formed. So, you spray it at your roots but it leaves a white foamy trail that needs to be worked, or combed, in - not a problem but I had imagined a clear liquid like some other root sprays I've used.

5.0,"The Vichy Aqualia Thermal Facial Essence Water works very well as a supplement to my usual facial moisturizer.  Apparently designed to ""add an extra layer of hydration"" to skin, I did find that this water was effective at keeping my usually dry patches on my face moisturized.  I have combination normal/dry skin, and often when I use moisturizers, my normal patches get a bit greasy feeling while my dry patches show no significant change (aka, my skin is still dry and flaky).  After using the Essence Water for a few weeks now, I've noticed that my entire face is well moisturized without being oily in some patches and flaky on others.  It's really helped simplify my facial routine, and the results are overall positive.

The Essence Water has a consistency of water, so it would be prudent to either use a cotton pad to apply, or to put this into a spray bottle.  Why Vichy didn't put it into a spray bottle to begin with is a bit confusing to me since using one really makes application much easier.  The Essence Water has a light floral scent to it which vanishes quite quickly.  I used it with my normal moisturizer and found that the scents paired well and didn't conflict with each other.  I did try using this water by itself, but it wasn't moisturizing enough for my skin, so keep in mind that this works best as a supplement.  I would likely buy this Essence Water in the future simply because seems to work, and gives my skin that extra little boost it needs.  Overall, it was the missing piece I've been looking for in my skincare routine - it's a simple, but good light moisturizer.",1484697600,2017-01-18
4.0,"My first time trying out Scott-Vincent Borba brand, which is featured on HSN, where you can see clips featuring the makeup artist behind the brand.  The packaging is beautiful, with much care and attention to details, explaining how to use.

I find the brush very soft and designed well for application of the powder.  The compact contains an inner piece you twist to grind just the amount of powder you need for your application.  I found the first time using that I had a bit more of the treatment than the makeup and my initial thoughts after applying was that I had a much lighter tone than my own.  Within a few minutes the powder matched up to my complexion and the look was smooth, bright and I felt like it was very natural.  I only wish there was a shade between the light and medium, as I found the light a little too light for me, especially as summer approaches.  I am a big fan of liquid foundation but would use this product when I feel like changing it up, especially in the warmer weather when a liquid base feels too heavy.

I found the powder did not irritate my skin, which can be slightly sensitive and can get a bit flushed -- no redness after using or breakouts.  Application with the included brush is easy and I can see this brush being excellent for bronzer as well.  The benefit of a dosage of skincare to your foundation with a high SPF (29) is a pleasant combo and I recommend for anyone looking for sun protection in a natural foundation.

Update: I've been playing around with this product and find it gives a beautiful finish over my usual liquid foundation.  It beautifully tones down the shine from liquid base, without being too matte or chalky.  It photographs well and I find I just need a light touch, so this compact should last quite some time used this way.",1430697600,2015-05-04

This gift set comes in a reusable metal tin and is a good way to sample this line of products. If you're already a fan, they are ideal for travel. Just note that these are very small in size.

 The cleanser with micellar water is probably my favorite of this set. It's an excellent makeup remover -- effective, while being gentle at the same time. The serum and cream are non-greasy and make the face feel plump and dewy.

The body lotion is just ok. I use a fantastic inexpensive one that I like better than this lotion by Vichy.

I have dry lips and this is one of the few longwear lip products that doesn't make them uncomfortably dry. I was also able to dab on a bit of lip balm over the lipstick once in awhile to keep my lips hydrated without the color coming off.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19

4.0,"Since reaching my 40s, I've begun noticing that my neck has begun to look more dry and crepe-y than I remember it being. I've long used my daily/nightly moisturizer (La Mer and Algenist, respectively) on my neck, but it no longer seems to be enough. Enter this neck moisturizer. It's an extremely thick, rich cream, about as thick as La Mer creme, so it's nice to feel like you're not getting watered-down moisturizer. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. There's no residue or tackiness at all. As for results, my neck actually looks much tighter and less dry. I also use it on my decollete during the day, and have noticed improved texture of the skin there, too.

I can't say whether it firms - I don't have any sagging yet - but it's genuinely excellent at giving my neck a more supple look without any crepiness (sp?) at all. Another plus is that it has caused no breakouts or irritation of any kind (yes, I'm dealing with both wrinkles and acne).

My only reservation is the fragrance. It's a light, clean smell that reminds me of Fresh brand products, but it's very noticeable. It's not strong and lingering like, say, Clarins or L'Occitane, but it *does* linger. I notice it less after a couple of hours, but if you're sensitive to fragrances this might irritate you. Otherwise, I'd recommend this cream for anyone looking for extra moisture on the neck and decollete.",1430784000,2015-05-05

5.0,"I have heard of Burberry but never tried their perfume lines. I do wear perfume daily and lotions.

This is a very mature scent. I would not think a teenager would wear it but a business/mature woman.  I have seen it listed as such on certain websites. I was able to try the lotion and must say it is divine! It smells light but yet enough that you can wear it alone for a few hours and it will emit enough fragrant off of your skin. I noticed it seems to last 4 to 6 hours before it fades.

It reminds me of Juicy Couture. It has a distinct scent to it and that was the first one I thought of. I also have a sherbet I use with my Juicy Couture; the texture is very much the same. I love the milk (lotion) it glides on easily but yet is not greasy. It smells so good I was hoping I would not fall in love with it but I have. Now I need to buy the perfume so I have a matching set.

I have worn this lotion alone and it is strong enough for people to smell it. I have worn it out for dinner or drinks. I think if you are going out for the evening and want a scent to last; this is one I would choose.

Very lovely! Everyone that has smelled it on me loves it. Again, your own body chemistry will be the deciding factor. My body seems to agree with it so off I go to buy the perfume for it!",1407801600,2014-08-12

5.0,"I normally use an eye lash curler by Revlon (not expensive).  I have just kept using it, because it is simple to just buy new refills and keep using the same one.  I curl my eye lashes a LOT.  I mean probably 4 or 5 times each eye before I'm satisfied.  I have medium length lashes, but they are blond and very fine.  It's difficult to get mascara on them without clumping or weighing them down.

When I first tried the Georgie Beauty curler, I was disappointed, because it doesn't open very wide. This makes you take an extra couple of seconds to get your eye lashes in place correctly.  I was going to rate this curler a 4 because of this.  However, they curl my lashes so much better than my previous curler!!  They LOOK very similar, but these curl better. I don't know that it is because of the pad or not, but something works better.  I now curl each eye 2 or 3 times instead of 4/5 times. One time would probably be fine, but I will have to let go of my thought process that I HAVE to do it more than once.  I'm extremely happy that I can cut off a little time in the mornings.

5.0,"As a DE shaving fanatic, this is absolutely the top of the line. I've shaved with a half-dozen blade razors, I've used a ton of brushes and soaps, and I've settled into a routine over the years. It was finally time to step up to my ""forever"" razor, and this is definitely it. Note to newbies: Don't be scared! Wet shaving isn't that scary. You can find a ton of videos online, and a good starter razor (such as cheaper razors in the Merkur line) can be gotten for a fraction of this price if you'd prefer to learn before you jump in here.

Pros:

Perfect finish. The shiny chrome is just perfect for me, it's gorgeous and functional. Grip is fine, after a couple of uses I haven't had any issues whatsoever.

Perfect action. I didn't realize the cap of the razor ""pops"" off, which is a bit unusual, but I'm sure I'll get used to it and it looks built to last. Bottom line, putting a blade on is quick and easy. Twisting the handle to select your ""aggressiveness"" is easy, higher number is harsher.

Perfect shave. I started off with a 1 to quickly knock off some hair, and it was easily the most gentle DE shave I've ever had. Lovely. Higher settings go as high as I ever want to go, as my favorite Feather blades are plenty sharp as always.

Cons:

High initial investment. Actually in recent years, the common razors make DE look cheaper than ever. As of writing, you can get this beautiful razor that will last longer than your lifetime for less than the cost of a few months' worth of the popular top-of-the-line disposable alternative. It's barely even a choice- switch to DE, save money.

Weird loading. Although the action of the cap is smooth, it's weird to ""pop off"" the top. My last razor had the ""butterfly"" open, which feels much more solid, with much less possibility for injury. Look up a video before you do this with a real blade.

Reference (my kit):

I put Feather blades in my razor, the ""samurai swords"" of the shaving world. My brush is a cheap but effective Tweezerman, and my shave soap alternates between handmade soaps and VanDerHagen. My current stand and bowl are actually from a VdH kit.

Overall, I can't recommend this razor highly enough. Merkur is like the Mercedes Benz of shaving. Generally sleek, stylish, technically wonderful. My only note would be- throw the included blade in the trash, or use it for projects. Merkur blades are usually garbage. I recommend Derby HD blades for beginners, and Feathers for pros.",1454284800,2016-02-01

4.0,"I was excited to try this because typically my lipsticks have always come in a thicker bullet and this thinner lipstick seemed like it would be easier to apply without a lip brush.  Functionally, I liked this lipstick.  It does apply easily straight from the tube.  It feels moisturizing and it's forgiving - I find it doesn't call attention to lip dryness or lines (probably due to the demi-matte finish).  And it wears well.  It's pretty opaque and lasts through eating an drinking.

But the color...that I wasn't a fan of.  I feel the need to mention that I generally LOVE bold lip colors.  My collection has various purples, a blue lipstick, funky oranges, metallics, etc.  I'm very open to color as long as it's flattering.  But this just wasn't.  I couldn't find many real life swatches of this color before ordering so I had no idea what to expect.  I thought the shade on Amazon looked nice -- a very neutral red, almost rose.  But it's clearly simulated because the real life color looks NOTHING like that.  It's more of a true/bright red, but not one that was particularly flattering with my light/medium neutral-toned skin, ashy blonde hair, and gray eyes.  Generally because my skin is pretty neutral I can pull off both warm and cool colors and don't find that many lipsticks just seem off, but for whatever reason this did.

I'm torn on how to rate this because the formula is 5 stars in my book, but the color is just not for me and is not accurately represented here.  I wish there were more real life swatches available because I do think this lipstick is excellent, it's just a matter of finding the color that's right for you.",1483747200,2017-01-07

5.0,"JOUER ESSENTIAL LIP ENHANCER claims to increase lip fullness and decrease fine lines  and it appears to live up its claims.  For best results, Jouer recommends applying the lip enhancer 3 times daily for 29 straight days.  While this product has not yet been used for the recommended 29 days, it has already yielded noticeably positive results.

POSITIVE

- This lip enhancer leaves lip feeling soft and moist with a nice, natural sheen.  It has an excellent conditioning quality to it.

- The product does eventually wear off, so the 3 daily applications are necessary to maintain the desired effect throughout the day.

- The cream is thin, non-greasy and applies evenly.  There was no noticeable fragrance or flavor to it.

NEGATIVE

- Jouer is a high-end product offered by a few select retailers common only to large market areas.  My wife felt this was a problem in that she prefers the experience of discussing potential cosmetic purchases with in-store consultants.

Bottom line, my wife was very impressed with the JOUER ESSENTIAL LIP ENHANCER and believes it to be superior to other lip balms/moisturizers shes used in the past.  She states her lips feel fuller and the glossy appearance enhances the fullness.  Having spent a good amount of money over the years buying such products, she states Jouer is now her go-to lip enhancer.",1399680000,2014-05-10
4.0,"UPDATE - 06/03/2015. I also just tried a Feather blade with this razor. The first shave was great and very smooth, the second - not so much. I am thinking that the Feathers are a one-shave blade. But if you are afraid that this razor + Feather = suicide - relax, you'll be fine :)

I decided to give 4 stars, because it is more expensive and I don't see why - the machines don't care whether it's slanted or straight. The configuration gets 5 stars, but the overall value - 4.

I started getting into straight edge shaving a couple of years ago, but because it takes a bit of time and care still fell back on cartridge razors when I was in a hurry or traveling. Then I switched to DE and never went back. My first razor was a Van Der Hagen from Target. It's just fine and if you can get it cheap it's great. It was the perfect compromise between convenience, portability and quality - much better shave than cartridge and much easier/faster than straight edge.

Then I needed something for thicker beard. I usually shave on Mondays and Saturdays, and recently had an even longer beard, so I tried the SLANT.  Wow! It mowed right through on the first pass. I only did additional passes afterwards to make it feel smooth to touch in all directions.

I don't know if I have a great technique, but it felt almost no different than a regular DE. Mind you, I read the scare stories and was being careful, but about as careful as I am with a regular DE anyway. They do take a touch more attention than cartridge, but that's about it.

FWIW I used Proraso pre shave cream, then Proraso shaving soap with Astra SP blades, finished with alum and then aftershave lotion. NO irritation, no bumps, no razor burn, no nicks, no cuts - best shave I ever got! (I can't say that I've perfected the straight edge).

You may be a ""newbie"" or a ""beginner"" with double edge, but you are not a child. This may be the last razor you need. But I know it won't stop you from having several, guys like to have a ""collection"" (or a fleet, as the case may be).

(Occasionally I read comments where guys have cut themselves a lot and blaming either the razor or the blade or the soap. Yes, it may be a razor/blade combination, though I have yet to experience problems with that, but it can also be trying to use a blade beyond its useful life or not using the right angle. I did notice that my very first blade started getting a tad harsh after a few nice shaves - I just have to adjust to the idea of replacing them more often.

5.0,"I am so particular about my mascara wands. I know that the super large, full bristle mascara brushes are in vogue, but I can't use them. They just leave my eye lids messy and my lashes lackluster.
While I'm not into the injection molded wands either, (I've found many to be too 'sharp' and 'pokey'), I decided to give mad lash a try since it was the only gently curved one.
Oh my. The brush is not sharp, doesn't poke, and deposits perfectly rich black pigment over each and every lash. The curve is gentle, and the brush head itself seems to flex with my lid. Amazing.
The formula is not dry, yet not too 'wet' either. It applies easily, and dries very quicky. My lashes don't feel brittle, and it does not flake or run. I'm able to apply a touch up coat mid day or evening without clumping.
Totally worth the price. I love it!",1463529600,2016-05-18

5.0,"This product line was recommended to me via a medi-spa when I had an IPL facial. As a 38 year old female with combination acne prone sensitive skin, I was scared to try a product I thought might either make me break out or react negatively. I had tried other products in the past from the drug store (Neutrogena) or beauty counter (Clinique), or online (Paula Begoun) all with mixed mediocre results.

The price was a little steep, but the three week trial kit this came in let me test drive it. I used each product in the trial kit as directed. After the three weeks had passed, my skin was clearing and managing the retinol very well! The brightness, tone and texture of my skin improved daily with very visible results! I decided to invest in all the full size versions of the products in the kit, and though it was pricey, it was completely worthwhile.

After two months of use, my skin is possibly the best it has ever been.  I have very minimal to no breakouts. I don't have to wear much makeup at all beyond a little foundation or concealer to even out my color.  Lines by my eyes and mouth are reduced. Redness is gone.  Old acne scars and discolorations are fading. the texture is GREAT.  I have gotten compliments on my skin lately. (You look healthy / are glowing! / look so young! You can't be 38!) I almost wish I had taken before and after photos. I cant believe it, but I actually threw out all the other non-PCA skin care products in my cabinet without hesitation.

Anyway, PCA Skin is an awesome line.  It does not disappoint. It is gentle yet effective. No greasiness or icky perfumes.

1.0,"I wet shave every time. I've been using straight razors and safety razors (double edge) razors for years. I ordered this because their wasn't much to choose from this last time. I now wish I'd ordered a bag of cookies or something. This stuff is like a soft version of Noxzema. The smell is medicine like and the shave was not very comfortable or close, and it doesn't build a very good lather. I was going to throw it away, but my wife may give it a go on her legs in the shower. Don't waste your money on this. If you want a good shave go with Colonel Conk glycerin shave soap. It comes in several different, pleasant aromas, and gives a superior shave to any canned or tub type cremes. I almost feel violated after using this product, compared to what I'm used to. I prefer using ""Edge"" to this if you have to go the easy route. Nothing beats the lather you get from a quality shave soap once you learn the technique of how to build a good lather. This stuff took handfuls to get enough to get a less than adequate lather, and the shave was not close, and my face is raw, like I almost didn't use any lather. Might be a good cold creme for removing makeup on women, but it's lousy for removing a beard.",1375660800,2013-08-05

Signs of aging aren't going to be smoothed away but the skin can be made healthier through exfoliation and for some the moisturizing is an excellent second step. As far as I can see, the innovation this product represents is that it's a 2-step process.

The products have a light citrus scent. They don't have SPF protection. They're not exclusively directed to people with ""crepey"" skin, since of course exfoliation and moisturizing are good for non-crepey skin.

I have medium thickness wavy hair and I'm able to get it all straightened in less than 10 minutes. I like the fact that it is thin so it allows me to flip the ends of my hair or even use it as a curling iron.

This is made to cover imperfections, marks, etc. I have a few minor acne scars and some redness and even with minimal coverage this foundation covered them up nicely. I used my finger to carefully dap on the areas I wanted to cover and in a few seconds it settled smoothly on my skin. I did use a primer beforehand(which is a must, IMO) and the foundation never clogged my pores. I did notice however, many hours later, that it started to almost dry up on my face in certain spots, like if I had a blemish or for some reason at the top of my cheekbones. I have naturally very oily skin so I found it odd that it would look this dry.

NUXE is a reputable French company which has been producing ""cosmetics of natural origin"" for some time.  Their Anti-Fatigue Moisturizing Eye Cream is used by my wife and she loves it.  The cream makes the skin under and around her eyes taut and thus reduces wrinkles while moisturizing.  The container is small at .05 ounces but only a small pea sized amount is needed per application.  The scent is pleasant like that of faint almonds and the creme is absorbed rapidly in the skin.  My wife swears that any former dark  circles under her eyes are now gone.  Great product at five stars.",1441929600,2015-09-11

I've had the luxury of trying both on my husband, and ""Aqua"" is so mellow.  This original Eternity is very nice, with a blend of mandarin, lavender, green botanics Midnotes  basil, geranium, sage Basenotes  woody combination of sandalwood, rosewood, amber.

It is a matter of taste, though; I like relaxing scents, and if you like brisk then you will like this better.  Aqua is more mellow.  I love them both, and please only squirt in the air and walk into it, because these are quite effective colognes.  1 spray on the skin can last 2 days.  You get your money's worth.

As far as after-effects, Calvin Klein ETERNITY ""AQUA"" is far more subtle, and that is how I love my men - clean, understated and relaxing. :=)

I've been using the daily moisturizer, the blemish peel and the sensitive skin peel for several weeks now and my ""fair sensitive breaks out over everything"" skin looks outstanding.

This kit includes an ""age defy serum"" which goes on like a light gel and is worn under your moisturizer.  I have noticed in the last two weeks my skin has felt really dry and tight, this has made a big difference.  I wish they made all over body serum like this!

I think this would make a great gift for someone who would appreciate a higher end skin product, but I took off one star because the sizes you get with this are small sample size, not full size and I think that they are priced too high for it to be a good deal.

4.0,"Beautifully packaged. The smooth, rectangular tube weighs twice as much as Wet 'n Wild cheap packaging on its sometimes very good quality but miserably packaged lipsticks. I often buy inexpensive lip products, so this finer packaging really feels luxurious to me. The color, Lucky, is similar to many of the neutral's on Colourpop's site. I just bought a bunch of those, so they're easy to compare. I'd say Lucky is just a bit pinker than CP's Magic Wand, quite a bit pinker than CP's Chi (my favorite). It is matte, but a touch shinier than I expected, which I actually like. It moisturizes nicely, which I expected from the ingredients. What surprised me was the amount of fragrance and plumping ingredients. The primary plumping ingredient is the Menthoxypropanediol. Its penetration is enhanced by the Tribehenin. It's the Menthoxypropanediol that gives the slightest menthol scent. I did experience some tingling from these and saw the slightest bit of lip plumping, but only when I applied the lipstick somewhat more thickly than usual. I also tested the lipstick by applying a ColourPop Ultra Matte to one side of my lips and this to the other side and definitely saw plumping. Supposedly, lip plumping ingredients often cause irritation, but I haven't had that problem from this product or any other. I do like it.",1469232000,2016-07-23

I haven't had any major chipping concerns, but I do use Seche Vite top coat. Only con is that it's rather messy to remove and can stain a bit, but it's so beautiful that it's worth it.

This ICELAND illuminator is exactly what I have been searching for. You only need to use the tiniest little bit of this stuff because a little goes a long way. I dab a little on my pinky finger and put little dots of this under my eyes. Then I use my pinky finger to smooth it under my eyes very gently so as to not pull or stretch the delicate skin under my eyes.

Illuminator helps reflect the light under my  eyes so they appear brighter and less tired. When I am doing a full face of makeup I put the liquid foundation on first, then illuminator, then an ever so light dusting of powder just so it sets. I usually do not wear illuminator if I am using a pressed compact alone, but I guess it could work the same way as when using the liquid.

I bought other major shaving creams to test and I have found myself going back to Proraso. The more and item cost the better it is. That is not true when comparing Proraso with the expensive  brands.

I do like the little nub at the end of the pencil so you can smudge it to your liking (good for the smoky eye look) but I wouldn't use that feature, personally.

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

For as wonderful as the Oribe shampoos have been, this product is worse than dippity do..for those of you old enough to remember. It makes my hair stiff and heavy and sticky, like I've used a ton of hair spray. In fact..hair spray works better if you flip your hair over your head and lightly spray the underside, it will give more volume, and far less heavy stickiness. I don't apply a lot of product to my hair, but this stuff, it seems that ANY is too much! I had to wash it out of my hair the next day because I couldn't stand the way it felt. If you want your hair to feel like your wearing a helmet, then this is for you! Otherwise, steer clear. It is one of the absolute worst products I've ever used.

5.0,"I've never used a cream blush and usually wear very little, if any, make-up.  I decided to give this product a try though and am happy with the results.  My first try, I ended up putting way too much on and it looked like I had gotten a sun burn.  The next try, I used a just a small dab and it worked much better, giving me a little color without making me look sun burnt.  I like that the application is easy.  I can't use powder based make up because they typically contain corn products and I'm allergic to corn, so breathing in the little corn dust in powders is not good for me.  I don't know if this product is comprised of corn, but since I can't breathe it in, I don't get sick from using it.

I did a little research on the Jane Iredale company and was happy to learn that they are cruelty free and don't allow their products to be sold in China.  Any company that sells make up or food products in China is required to either test their products on animals themselves or pay for a Chinese company to do the testing.

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

It seems expensive for what it actually does, and I have not noticed any noticeable effects (though it recommends 3X daily for 29 days to see improvement, and I don't like it enough to use it that much).

5.0,I am a believer. I bought this polish and applied it as instructed and it lasted a 10 days. I work with my hands and wear gloves on and off all day. I also do dishes at least three times a week. There was some very small minor chipping at the tips but because my nails also grew out I just filed them down and the chipping was gone and the polish looked new. On one of the nails where it chipped in the corner I just applied some more polish to that tip corner and it was fine after that.  I am very happy with my purchase. Any new color I want I will check and see if it is offered in Vinylux before I purchase another brand. It is easy to apply and dries quickly which is great. My nails feel stronger. The polish feels thicker than normal polish and is very strong once dried. I haven't tried to take it off yet so I don't know how easy that is but it has to be easier than gel. I like gel polish but I get bored with the color after a week and want a new color.

5.0,"Burberry Body Tender Milk is like a light lotion, packaged in a beautiful glass bottle with a apple/floral, slightly spicy fragrance with some subtle musky undertones. I like it because it isn't a sweet scent. I love the smell of some sweet perfumes on other people, but they don't seem to react the same with my body oils and seem overwhelming after a very short time. This one stays fresh smelling even after wearing it for hours. It doesn't seem to last all day, but perhaps that's because I grew accustomed to smelling it and don't notice it as much after a while.

The glass bottle looks luxurious on my dressing table. It has a pump type applicator that dispenses a drop or two of this scent at a time which is the perfect amount. The scent is light and rather delicate and never seems overwhelming. It seems sophisticated, a scent suitable for business or formal wear. That's partly because it isn't too strong. I think a person would have to be standing close to smell it rather than noticing it when you walked into a room. This is the type of fragrance I like.",1408233600,2014-08-17

3.0,"""Sensual. Vibrant. Captivating."" That's what the advertisement is selling, but I have to be honest, upon my first sniff I had to check and make sure it was indeed a men's fragrance. Perhaps it was the floral overtones that caught my attention, or the way it reminded me of cotton candy the longer I lingered over my husband's neck where he'd sprayed it, but this scent wasn't what I'd expected when I read the those three little words.

The scent is musky with a hint of spice, but sweet. I'd say it would be perfect for a tween, teen or twenty-something, but might be a little too soft for older gents. It's a youthful scent that while not off-putting; it's clean and fresh, isn't particularly sexy to my olfactories. Obviously scent is a subjective thing though, and while it may not be my cup of tea.

My husband initially liked the scent, but said over the course of a few hours of wearing it he began to find the scent off putting. He said it smelled like 'food' to him. I asked him to describe the 'food' in question and he said he couldn't. I asked him if he'd dribbled some food on his shirt.  Rolling his eyes he assured me it was the 'Reveal'.  We decided that for us - this scent was not good.

Fragrances work differently with each person's body chemistry to produce unique scents - that's why there are so many!  I give this 3 out of 5 stars (on the Amazon rating scale that's 'It's OK'...) based upon the experience my husband and I have had with this scent.  It's not bad, but it's definitely not for either of us. However by looking at other reviews I guess our experience puts us in the minority.  Take this into account before buying this product.

My advice regarding purchasing ANY scent  you've not yet tried: Go to a local department store that carries it to spray some on and wander around for a few hours first. I think that's the only true way to know if a fragrance is for you.

'Sweet. Clean. Unpredictable.'  These would be the three words I'd use to describe 'Reveal' after experiencing it first hand. Test drive before you buy. If you try it out, you'll have the best chance at enjoying it and not being disappointed... or hungry.",1444608000,2015-10-12
3.0,"I like this product's cooling sensation, but as a Botox substitute you can expect only so much. There is no expectation that this product is going to last for months let alone days. I applied this and waited five minutes.....no change. Ten minutes and my target points looked more relaxed but really there was no miraculous improvement. My skin looks pretty good because I use a lot of moisturizers and see a dermatologist on a regular basis. The flaws I see on a regular basis are apparently insignificant or non-existent because I get a lot of compliments about my fresh looking skin and lack of laugh lines, crows feet, and wrinkles.
Anyway this product didn't perform miracles and didn't make me instantly 30 again. The effects lasted a few hours. The next morning I went back to being me.
Try this if you will. The results may be better, it does have a great cooling feeling, but it is only a temporary topical fix and not a Botox substitute.",1433548800,2015-06-06
5.0,"It's funny, so many cheaper brands of facial lotion fail because they try to do so much. They try to be the deepest moisturizer ever, or get rid of wrinkles, or for some unknown reason think it's a good idea to heavily perfume their lotion so we'll feel luxurious or something.

What I love about this straightforward and simple face cream is that it does exactly what it says and nothing more. It moisturizes my combination skin perfectly, not too heavy, not too light, and the sun protective factor works great. I can't smell it at all, which is perfect.

On most days, I spent about 1 to 2 hours out in the sunshine gardening. If I forget to use sunscreen, I definitely feel some soreness on my face and neck. So having sunscreen included in my normal daily facial moisturizer is great.

I was also really impressed that the pump dispenser dispenses an accurate amount to cover my face. When I first used it, I snickered at how little it gave me and I pumped out three globs of it and started covering my face. I quickly realized that this facial lotion goes farther than most brands do, so one pump was actually perfect for my face, and I'll use a second pump for my ears, neck, and back of my neck. Given how little you need to use for effective coverage, this actually seems like a pretty good deal as well as being an effective product.",1371600000,2013-06-19

2.0,"I wanted to love this. The description sounded just like something Id like and i hoped that the toilette parfum would be light enough to wear to work and not offend anyone. Plus I have used other products from Crabtree and Evelyn and been pleased. Alas, it was not to be. I have a sensitive nose, overly sensitive probably. But this was all kinds of no. No with a capital NUH uh. The was to lavender as banana popsicles are to bananas. I adore a good fresh lavender but this was not a clear astringent lavender, it was a chemical maelstrom of lavender. It has a heavy alcohol top note, which is to be expected with a toilette water but it hung on much longer than I wanted, but the powdery middle note was just odd and it lasted much too long in that middle range of too strong to be two hours old. Then the bottom note is too much Grandmas hankie drawer for me, though it was more in the muted range I expected.

My advice if you want to try it because you like that old fashioned type of scent is to apply it properly- spray into the air and walk through it, never apply directly to the skin. Or try using it as a light room spray or closet spray. I don't want to preach here but gone are the days of women wearing heavy scents into work and getting away with it. So many of us are crammed into more reconditioned air and we all need to be sensitive to the noses of our coworkers. No one wants to be remembered as that strongly stinky person in the office.

It looks just like it is pictured in the bottle - pinkish purple. I tried to take pics after applying but my camera wouldn't capture the real color. I tried in sun/shade/indoors/lights.. but didn't work. The color is really pretty to naked eye.

Saturday Disco Fever is a bright pure orange color. This is not a very blazing neon, so I am able to wear it to work. It looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors. I felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in Summer. I was a little apprehensive at first because I personally don't like Yellow/Orange shades. But this color worked for me. It is more red-toned than yellow-toned. This dark Orange looks good on nails too.

The formula on both the polishes is great. Two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish. They dry quickly but dry matty-ish. So top coat is a must for me.

3.0,"This lipstick was like a little, elegant present when I opened it, although the color wasn't what I expected. This is my first experience with the butter LONDON brand of cosmetics. The lipstick feels wonderful and the packaging takes it up a few more notches.  I can easily see this lipstick given as bridesmaids gifts or stocking stuffers. However, you'll want to be careful with the color choice. Despite the luxurious feel and the beautiful packaging, this lipstick did not live up to its promises when I used it, so I'm on the line with my opinion.

I received the Lucky color and it looked beautiful in the tube. The color is described as mauve pink, but I thought it ran closer to a nude than a pink. When I put it on, it took on a brownish tint that disappointed me. Almost like a pale spice or cinnamon. The lipstick is also looks a little sheer and pearlized when on.

This lipstick is supposed to plump your lips, or at least slightly fill out the lines. I felt a slight tingling and cooling, similar to a mentholated cream, but very faint. The company says 100% of users noticed an immediate increase in lip fullness. I applied the lipstick to one side of my lips and compared sides after 10 minutes and again after an hour. I did not notice any difference in lip fullness or the lines. Maybe it's just me? I'm 54, if that matters.

The packaging is gorgeous! The box is black with floral design, and it has an envelope style closure. When you open it, you are presented with a gorgeous floral on black print that reminds me of English garden art. The glossy black tube has weight to it, and it's shaped like a stick of butter. This makes it easy to grip and remove the lid. The lid is magnetized, so it slips back on quickly and securely, without twisting.

Warning: Mine arrived after traveling in very high heat. The lipstick was not melted, but it was not stable in the tube. I was too anxious and decided to try it right away and it wobbled a little. I set it aside until the next day so it could cool properly, but it never regained stability. I highly suggest waiting until you use it.

My overall impression of this lipstick is that it's okay. I like it, but I won't replace it when it's gone. The color was too brown for me, so I blended it on my lips with a little bit of tarte cosmetics lipstick that was too pink. The result was gorgeous, but that's a lot of trouble to go through for such a pricey lipstick. It also did not have the plumping or line filling effect as claimed. It didn't last any longer on my lips than products half the price. If you are sure of the color are are not expecting any other frills, the packaging is spectacular and it would make a nice gift.",1469145600,2016-07-22

Both did a great job of removing make up, including mascara, gently and completely but neither could remove lip stain.  Both did an excellent job of removing sweat and grime post workout.  The only difference I noticed was the Vichy water left my face feeling a little tacky.  Not a lot, but when I lightly drag my fingertips across my cheeks, I can feel a slight pulling on the Vichy side. The tachy feeling diminishes with time and after about 10 minutes,  both sides felt the same.

So, while I like Vichy products I'm not sure I like this one enough to switch.  Especially when the product I'm using does an equally good job for less money.",1447200000,2015-11-11

4.0,"I tried Proraso and Col. Conk shaving soap side by side.  I prefer Proraso.  It lathers very well, the lather makes shaving effortless, and proraso has a nice cooling effect.  It is quite a bit more expensive than Col. Conk, but I think it is worth it.",1329091200,2012-02-13
4.0,"You get 4 masks in this box and with it being recommended to use once a week, the box will last about a month. I'm not sure its worth $30 for a month of masks, especially when you can get masks so much cheaper. The product is neat though in the sense that its two pieces that you just apply to your face and let sit for 10 minutes. So if you don't like dipping your hands in mud to rub onto your face this product is definitely less messy. I feel it made my skin feel smooth and clean but similar to other cheaper masks. It did fit my face, its one size fits all, but it didn't completely form to my face and I kept pushing it down into place. Lightweight product and washes off easily. I haven't noticed anything with my pores or skin glowing yet, but it did feel better than just washing with soap.",1470528000,2016-08-07
3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

The cream is thick but easy to apply. Only couple pea size of cream is able to cover the hands well. The best part is you can feel a nice and thick cover on your hands but it gets absorbed very quickly so there is no such oily touch. Usually I only use hand cream in the very dry days but with this I have no problem using it every day. Also the smell is really good, not intensive just a light and elegant smell.

The three small bottles of serum bottles arrive to you neatly packaged. I have attached some pictures for your review. For each application, you use approximately 4 drops.  I used the drops alone, to test the basics. Fragrance wasn't an issue and after using for a week, I experienced no breakouts. The Smoother was actually neat. Your skin looks and feels hydrated.  At the price point, I can't get excited over it though. Perhaps with the facial trainer, the serum would give more miraculous results?",1465948800,2016-06-15

5.0,"VENeffect Anti-Aging Lip Treatment, 0.34 fl. oz. is top of the line  product. It is not like a chapstick or other lip balm. It does not go on waxy or leave a residue. It feels nice after being applied and has a light pleasant scent.

This is all natural and made in the USA. It is an expensive product so using this is for sure a luxury, but for someone who has a serious problem with dry lips to the point they are hurting, it would be worth the expense. It would really work where other products simply won't. The container is small but a little bit goes a long way. Use some type of applicator as opposed to a finger when administering the product and you will reduce waste. Start with small amounts, it goes on very easy.

This product is truly a high end item. You can of course buy cheaper lip treatments, but with this it is one of the rare cases where the quality matches the price. VENeffect Anti-Aging Lip Treatment, 0.34 fl. oz. highly recommended for those with bad lips that need help.",1457827200,2016-03-13

I was pretty amazed at the difference in the rough, crocodile skin of my hands, made worse by my constant washing while I had the flu. The scent is almonds with a light, floral undertone.

4.0,I really do love these Thermoblend products. Great makeup. This 'camo' is easy to apply and covers all skin imperfections (i.e. I have some skin damage from the sun with age spots). I did deduct one star simply because I thought this was a little lighter than I was expecting. I ended up smoothing it out and covering it with my standard foundation so the lightness blended easily away. I do recommend Thermoblend overall because of the way my skin looks (virtually flawless) after using these products.,1499472000,2017-07-08

The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.,1467331200,2016-07-01
5.0,"Calvin Klein Eternity Eau de Parfum has a fascinating product description: white flowers and creamy woods. Topnotes  freesia, mandarin, sage Midnotes  muguet, white lily, marigold, narcissus Basenotes  sandalwood, patchouli, amber. Upon initial application, I can smell the floral topnotes along with just a passing hint of sage. That dissipates within a few minutes, revealing midnotes that are floral but without being either cloying or overwhelming. With the passage of 30 minutes or so, the basenotes predominate with an enticing mixture of sandalwood, amber and patchouli. The basenotes will linger, making them Eternity's signature aroma and for which it will be best remembered. Very pleasing in all respects, everyone that I introduced to Eternity Eau de Parfum enjoyed its subtle mixture of floral, wood and spice elements. A single application lasts for 3-4 hours. This is a subtle and elegant perfume.",1431043200,2015-05-08
5.0,"This is a great protein free mask that will cure dry hair completely.  It's really hydrating and leaves my hair soft, shiny and feeling very healthy.  I use it for about an hour with heat and it works like a charm.  It's super thick and rich and it makes my hair very smooth.  It also smells amazing.  It's very thick so a little bit goes a long way.  I've also used it overnight and it works just as well that way.  If you have dry hair, this is the perfect remedy.  Although it's very moisturizing, it's not heavy and my hair is still bouncy and full of body afterward.  I use it about once every two weeks, even once a month, and it keeps my hair in great condition.  I also use the Agadir moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, which are really great and super nourishing.  These three products have cured my dry hair completely.  I no longer have a fuzzy halo but now have very smooth, silky strands instead.  Although this product does contain some silicone, it's the water soluble type and there's no build up or residue.  They do help with the smoothness and don't seem to interfere with the hydration.  This is by far the best moisturizing mask I've ever used and I recommend it for anyone with dry hair.  You can also use it in place of regular conditioner if your hair needs extra attention.  It will work well in 15-20 minutes if you decide to use it this way.  I think Agadir products are much better than Moroccan Oil and are much more reasonably priced on Amazon.  My stylist charges $40 for the mask and $20 apiece for the shampoo and conditioner.  I also use the Agadir serum which eliminates frizz completely and adds healthy shine and also protects really well against heated styling tools.  The serum is $40 in the salon but is $15 on Amazon so my stylist is definitely not getting my $$, lol!  Right now, I'm loving all of these Agadir products and am thinking about trying the volumizing shampoo and conditioner, which my girlfriend uses and loves.  I'm definitely telling all my friends about this great brand.  The results have been nothing short of miraculous for me.",1447804800,2015-11-18

She found this serum was great for removing the redness and that it even seemed to retexture the skin of her nose  and made large pores less prominent.  She found it to be a great product but was alarmed by the price of about $70 for just one ounce.

4.0,"This is a pretty good golden eyeliner.  I am not the best at applying eyeliner.  I tend to have problems with skipping and wavy lines.  This liner was actually quite easy to apply.  I used an eyeliner brush, and it swept on with no problems.  I did find that putting the liner on the brush was more of a production than I expected.  I dipped my brush in, but the texture of the liner meant that my brush seemed to resist it- it didn't pick up color like I hoped.  I ended up having to swirl my brush around in the product and really load it up.  I was afraid that this would lead to a mess on my eyes.  Thankfully it did not, but it is a bit annoying to get the product on your brush.  That said, this liner drew a fool-proof line on my eyes.  The color was lighter than I expected, which means that with one coat you can use this for daytime.  For evening I would build up multiple coats to get a more obvious flashy gold.  I would definitely recommend putting down an eye base before using this liner.  It is not waterproof, and it does tend to wear off.  Removal is easy with pretty much any cosmetic remover.  Also, this eyeliner did not irritate my eyes, which I appreciated, though I only used it on my top lid.  Overall, this is not a bad metallic liner.",1498348800,2017-06-25

4.0,"This is neither a cleaner, nor a moisturizer.  Serums have a specialized use. This serum claims to soften fine lines and wrinkles, to even skin tone, and give a glow. Im at the age, mid 50s, where wrinkles are starting to pop out everywhere. This smells nice, slightly like oranges, goes on easy, nice and smooth, not greasy. For my skin, I can see immediate improvement in the evenness of the skin tone and an overall healthy look. My foundation has moisturizer in it, so I put Bliss Serum on and then my foundation. At night I use the Serum and then a moisturizer, not of this brand.  It seems like I am holding back more wrinkles, hard to say if its this serum, the moisturizer, or the cleaner, or the combination of all.  I do like what it does right away to my face, I've found myself wearing foundation less because of it.

Its a serum which is a relatively new term in cosmetics.  Wikipedia (Nov 2015) defines serum as a buzzword for lotion in the cosmetic market.  A few cosmetic sites say there is no formal definition, but cosmetic serums are rapidly absorbed and highly potent. They are the cousins of lotions and moisturizers. They typically focus on one of these areas: dry skin, aging, dark spots.  My concern because it does absorb into your skin so fast is with the ingredients of which I am not qualified to speak to and will watch for others opinions on this.",1448755200,2015-11-29

5.0,"There are very few personal items one can buy these days and know that they will last beyond the lifetime of the user.  This five piece grooming set is one of them.  I have one of my own that I received as a child from my Grandfather and it is as good as the day it was bought.  Considering that that was in 1951 (when they were given to me) and this is 2015 (well you do the math).  One of my sons has this exact set he purchased a while back.  All three were made by J.A. Henckel and as far as I can tell they've only improved the product this time around.  The clippers are now the thinnest folding ones you can buy (the originals were not folding back then but they are still sharp as a tack) The other tools appear to be about the same and of the same fine quality a little sleeker and a little slimmer but still sturdy and finely made.  I got this for my son to use as I don't plan on dying anytime soon and the upgrade will make it possible to pass along both sets to his two boys.  The price is up there for a personal grooming kit but the cut and the quality of the tools involved and considering they will be used month in and month out make them more than worth it.  Just be careful to keep them together in their leather pouch and don't leave them laying about when you're done.

It's good to see something just as well made now as it was a hundred years ago in this hurried world of ours.  If you're looking for a gift that will indeed become an heirloom passed on long after you're gone then you have found it.  Zwilling grooming tools are world famous for just that quality.
And considering the lifetimes they'll be in use the price is a pittance to pay.

I recommend this personal grooming kit without a shadow of a hesitation.  Hope you and yours enjoy it as long and as well as we have.",1433116800,2015-06-01

This goes on easily Nd absorbs quickly with no irritation which has been a common problem for me in the past. I might add that i sometimes get spotty patches of eczema in this are, but so far there has been no recurrence

5.0,"Mustela has been making skincare for babies and their mommies since 1950, and are committed to using natural products that are safe. Most of the ingredients they use are plant based.

This kit comes with 2 products:  one 150 ml squeeze tube of Stretch Mark Prevention Cream, and one 75 ml squeeze tube of bust firming serum.  They are both in easy to apply bottles with pop style tops.
They both have a strong fragrance that I find to be pleasant and feminine.  Quite luxurious after a hot bath.

The Stretch Marks Prevention cream is created to help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy and is made from 3 principle ingredients: Galactorabinan, Avocado Peptides, and Shea butter.  The Bust firming serum is made with  3 key ingredients which are centella asiatica, elastoregulator, and avocado peptides.  The ingredients are created by Mustela Labs, and again, are plant based, natural, and safe. There are other ingredients in both products, like water and binding properties, but the key ingredients for skin softening are as listed above.

Hypoallergenic, safe for breast feeding mothers, and created with the environment in mind, I think this set makes a great baby shower gift.  The sooner a mother to be can begin applying the stretch mark prevention cream, the better.  (Of course, lots of people get stretch marks during growth spurts, so this cream can be used for anybody, you don't have to be expecting).

The instructions on the box recommend starting the cream by the 8th month of pregnancy.

Just based on the ingredients, the reputation and longevity of the company, and the wonderful fragrance of the products, I like this set.  It would be ideal as part of a bridal shower gift basket.

As far as results, the Mustela company had clinical studies that are quite favorable.  In their studies, 26 expectant mothers used the stretch mark prevention cream and 96% of them developed no stretch marks.  Those are positive results!",1490486400,2017-03-26
5.0,"I got this for my girlfriend to try because she loves the various Shea Butter hand creams that L'Occitane makes. Each year for Christmas I get her one of their sets with lots of different scents in it and she never seems to use anything else.

This seemed like a natural, but she was hesitant at first as it apparently has very little Shea Butter in it but she still thought it might be too oily as she doesn't have dry skin. However, she thinks it works just fine, cleans without drying her face, and she was pleased that it washes away easily and doesn't seem to leave any oil.",1428537600,2015-04-09
3.0,"I find it hard to color match online, but this one was pretty close to my skin color.  Every now and then you have a cut, bruise or something on your body that you want to cover up.  This brand is great for concealer, so I thought I would check out the body foundation.  There is a lot of info online for tips and tricks to get good coverage.  This does work well, but you have to set it after for sure.  I know people who have used this type of product to cover tattoos, or scars and they work well.",1515456000,2018-01-09
2.0,"This grooming kit comes in a nice, supple leather case.  However, it seems quite overpriced for what it is.  You get 1) a metal file and nail cleaner; 2) a manual nose and ear hair trimmer; and 3) a cleverly designed set of clippers with a retractable lever.  After using the set, I think the clippers are the only element that reflects typical Henckels standards and quality.

The file is fine for what it is, but it's nothing special.  It's a stainless steel nail file with a decent finish.

The real downfall of this kit is the rotary trimmer.  It is a manually operated trimmer (i.e., you have to hold the mid-barrel piece and spin the cutting shaft assembly by hand).  And it does not cut hair so much as it pulls it out.  It was an unpleasant experience to use it on nose hairs as some of them are growing from highly sensitive areas.  In the past, I have used a Panasonic battery-powered trimmer and never had a similar problem; the Panasonic cut the hairs with a rapidly spinning blade.  This trimmer, on the other hand, is difficult to operate because you cannot hold it perfectly still while also spinning the cutting shaft assembly with your other hand.  Sure, it isn't going to cut your flesh, and it feels substantial.  But unfortunately it appears to have been designed for masochists.  There is a small brush inside the base of the trimmer to help wipe away the follicles the trimmer pulls out with the hairs.  This device appears to be the principal reason the kit costs so much, and it ruins the value of the kit.

The nail clipper is fine and sharp.  You operate it by pulling the lever to extend it from the body of the trimmer and then, once it pops up, by pushing it forward to put it into position to generate leverage.  The clippers are sharp and work well on fingernails.  But they alone are not worth the price of admission for this kit.

If I were to receive this as a gift, I would suspect that the giver was trying to punish me for some (imagined) slight.  Better than being sealed behind a brick wall perhaps, but only just.

Not recommended.",1442102400,2015-09-13
5.0,"I've struggled with acne for years, as a teen, as well as an adult. In my experience, salicylic acid treatments work better on oily skin or teen acne, while adult acne (or more troublesome acne) is better treated by benzoyl peroxide. Because of my long history with these products, I didn't expect to be too impressed by this product because it is a salicylic acid treatment.

I get recurring acne on the left side of my face in a very localized area. Sometimes the acne will disappear for months, but it always comes back, and it usually lingers for awhile. When I started getting acne again after a long period of not having any, I decided to try this. I used it as a spot treatment on the few pimples that had popped up overnight. To my surprise, I only needed to apply it once, and the acne hasn't returned. I don't know if I would call it a miracle--perhaps I got lucky--but I am seriously impressed. Maybe it is the inclusion of hyaluronic acid that made the difference?

I have now been acne free for about a week. When my acne returns (because it always does) I will try this again, and if I don't have the same results, I will update this review.

If other acne sufferers are looking for an alternative or natural cure, I would like to mention that neem and zinc (in combination) have worked well for me in the cast.",1512604800,2017-12-07

5.0,"My wife has beautiful curls in her hair, but sometimes she likes to straighten it to achieve different looks.  Therefore, I knew she would enjoy the Luma Bella Cool Mist Straightener, especially since it features the ceramic plates that she prefers.  According to my wife, ""I like how soft and smooth my hair feels after I use it.  Although I don't have to use the cool mist feature, I like the added shine I get on my hair when I do choose to use it.  (There are two tubes of LunaBellar Macadamia Conditioning Treatment included, but she can also fill the straightener's reservoir with distilled water.)  I also like the protective guard around the floating ceramic plates, because they keep me from burning myself.  However, it does make the straightener a little awkward to use, especially with my shorter hair.  I am getting used to it the more I use it, so it's not a major problem.""  After reviewing the manual enclosed, I also tested the safety features such as the temperature control and lock, indicator lights to know when the device has reached the desired temperature for your hair type, automatic safety shut-off after approximately one hour, and a hinge lock to keep the blades closed when in storage.  Thus far this has proven to be a very well designed and functional straightener, but I'll update this review if we find some issues with it in the future.",1469577600,2016-07-27
5.0,"I love the Clarisonic facial cleansing system, and the brush heads are a large part of it.  This set of four provides a good introduction to the different kinds and is especially useful if you don't yet know which brush you prefer.  The only brush I hadn't tried before receiving this assortment was the cashmere; its bristles are about twice as long as the regular and are incredibly soft.  I almost hated putting soap on the cashmere head to use for the first time.  This set also includes a Sensitive Skin, Radiance, and Deep Pore Cleansing heads.  My favorite and go-to brush is the Radiance, but Clarisonic makes it so easy to change from one to another that I use the Deep Pore one once a week.  Even though I have sensitive skin, I feel that that head is unnecessary, although maybe I would if I were younger.  Of course, the cashmere one is also unnecessary, but it feels so luxurious that it's worth trying at least through one brush head.

This would make a great gift set, particularly as a companion to one of Clarisonics devices.  Yes, the brush heads are expensive -- the whole system is -- but it makes sense to buy them in a pack like this that offers a little savings rather than buying them individually.

4.0,"Useless History: I started growing a mustache in senior year of high school - back in the day when doing such things would get you a trip to the principal's office. My favorite photo is a shot of me was taken at the HS senior prom - me in a white tux carrying a cocktail glass, smoking a cheap cigar and sporting an embarrassingly thin bit of fuzz on my upper lip. That was long enough ago that I would plead the 5th if asked the date that picture was taken. Back then, I quickly learned that simply lathering up my face and shaving everything smooth was fast and simple - in ad-speak, ""low maintenance"". However, because I was stubborn (then as now), I refused to give up on growing facial hair and by mid freshman year in college, I had a decent mustache. That's when I learned that these things required ""high maintenance"". The first indication was when I had my first bowl of creamy New England clam chowder and had to use a pile of napkins to keep my clearly-too-long whiskers clean. My solution - a trip into NYC to buy a really nice pair of Hoffitz scissors to trim my luxuriant facial hair. As a fun gift, my girl friend gave me a tiny mustache maintenance kit that consisted of a small mirror and a tiny comb - all neatly packaged in a plastic tube. Those items made staying groomed properly easier. In fact, a history professor pulled me aside after class one day and asked how I kept my ""stash"" so neat. Alas, that cool little mustache comb disappeared over the years but when I saw the Baxter beard comb, I had a flash back to my salad days. Naturally, I had to have it.

Hands On: Getting the tiny comb out of the tiny, shrink-wrapped box required the aid of a pocket knife. Trust me, it's definitely worth the effort because, holding it in your hand, you realize that you have a remarkable work of art in front of you. The plastic material is highly polished (rather than molded) and the teeth hand cut - again, not molded. The overall length is just a smidgen over 3 inches so it's pretty small. But the size makes working in the tight space under my nose easy. Call it right-sized.

Recommendation: Duck Dynasty stars aside, If you have a mustache and beard, you will need to trim them. How you do that is as personal as the style, size and shape of your facial hair. I still have a high quality pair of scissors secreted away so that it doesn't get used for anything other than hair grooming and now, I have a wonderful little gem of a comb keeping it company to use while I do this all important grooming task.

Final Thoughts: If you don't have facial hair - move on. Else, give this neat little comb a look.",1391040000,2014-01-30
5.0,"My tan-complection Filipina wife LOVES Dermablend.

She has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  It turns out fantastic the way she does it.  I wish I could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  I've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful SPF to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).

She's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the USA and has tried many products to stop them.  The only thing that has worked was going back to Philippines for 3 months.  We have no idea if it's something in the ingredients of something she eats here, or some sort of spray on the vegetables... but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of Dermablend products.

She has 5 different creams, a couple of powders and 2 sticks, varying shades of tan.  She can apply them very quickly now, but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such.  I'm pleased that Dermablend is available for people like her, though it's a little expensive for the amount you get (my frugal opinion).

She's worth it!

Afternote:  I asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they don't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion YouTube tutorials.",1499990400,2017-07-14

I have been using and exploring skin care for quite some time now, so I have had a chance to use many different brands at a wide variety of price points.  Let's see how Vichy Neovadiol Compensating Complex compares to the creams I have used.

WHAT TYPES OF CREAMS HAVE I USED
Some of the creams that I have used are as follows
Lancome Absolue
Lancome Renergie Multi Action
Algenist Firm and Lift
Algenist Genius
Loreal Vitalift
Yes to Blueberries
L'Occitane
SKII
L'Oreal Genesis
LaPrarie
Clarins
Christian Dior (variety of them)
Chanel
Shiseido

The above list only reflects some of the brands I have had a chance to explore and test out.  Keeping this in mind, I will compare this cream for effectiveness and what results it achieves.

WHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?
Vichy Neovadiol Compensating Complex is indicated to be for mature skin that is post menopausal.  That means that the targets are for plumping skin, shrinking pores, radiance, making skin feel denser (thus more youthful), contours, and more of an even tone to skin.  This cream does not have SPF in it which I am THRILLED about.  If you want to use SPF, then you can put it on yourself.

The jar is glass another feature that I like.  It has a tight fitting cap with an inner seal which helps the cream from drying out.  The color is a beautiful iridescent peach color glass and the cream inside is an icy peachy pink color.  It is a bit thicker than the night version of this cream&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vichy-Neovadiol-Replenishing-Care-Night-Cream-1-69-fl-oz/dp/B017R8MYGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vichy Neovadiol Replenishing Care Night Cream, 1.69 fl. oz.</a>.

HOW DOES THIS CREAM PERFORM?
When applying this cream, it is extremely lightweight- not at all thick and sticky like you might expect.  It goes on easily and absorbs VERY quickly into the skin.  The best way to put it on is to dot about a lentil to pea sized dot on each quadrant of the face and then spread it into the skin.  There is a very heavy scent to this, which I have to be honest at first with the night cream made me want to retch, but I quickly got used to it.  Many people would probably find it pleasant, but at first it was hard to get used to.

I have used this with the night cream at night so the combination of the action is to be considered.  I find that the cream leaves my skin very plump, glowy, moisturized for 12 hours until I use the night cream, and there is absolutely no sticky residue.  I find that it does seem to work best when I apply&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/99-Natural-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serum-1-fl-oz-29-6-ml-Liquid/dp/B008PPXBA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">99% Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1 fl oz (29.6 ml) Liquid</a>&nbsp;on BEFORE any moisturizer and after cleansing the skin.  I use this with all skin care as it improves performance greatly.

This skin care line will enable you to have a much better canvas to use makeup on for older women.  I do makeup on older women quite often and one of the biggest problems is not using really good skin care first.  This skin care (along with the night cream) will greatly improve the skin so that makeup application will be much nicer and less apt to look caked on.

I would say that this is an excellent skin care line for mature skin if you can tolerate the fragrance.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CREAM
Excellent price for what you get
Glass jar
A little goes a long way
It is not sticky
Absorbs quickly
Differences begin quickly
Does what it promises

WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS CREAM
Fragrance is a bit overbearing.

THE BOTTOM LINE
I have to say compared to the other lines of skin care that I have tried over the years on myself and on others whose skin I work on, this line of Neovadiol Compensating Complex is a serious contender for performance with good price range compared to high end.  I would put it in the same ball park as some of Lancome, Algenist, Dior, SKII, and I find it even better than some Chanel, Shiseido, Clarins, and L'Oreal (although this company appears to have ties with L'Oreal).  I really do not like the heavy scent, but I did get used to it.  It does not make my eyes water, and it fades away quick enough to be able to use it.  For the price vs performance, compared to other lines, I have to say this is a five star, although I am tempted to give it four stars due to the fragrance.

If you or someone you know has mature skin this would be a great cream to try out to improve makeup application and skin appearance.",1460246400,2016-04-10

5.0,Great product!,1446336000,2015-11-01
3.0,"I am used to paying premium prices for premium cosmetics and perfume, if it is worth the cost. While I like the look and feel of this product, I feel it is priced well above what it delivers for the amount you receive.  It made my skin feel smooth and look more uniform, but I would spend my money on POREfessional rather than buy this product. Putting half on one side of my face and half of the VL on the other, POREfessional has better muting qualities and can be worn solo for a more even skin tone without a full face of foundation.  Under BB cream and foundation they were tied as a base layer.

There are a lot of great primers out there and I think it is VITAL that a gal go to the department store or Sephora and try them on in person before purchasing online.  Every formula is different and testing many makes a big difference in finding the perfect one for your skin.  I used to work a cosmetics counter in college and I can recommend updating your whole routine every few years because your skin changes as you age and what worked great for you at 27 may not be the best any more at 33.

Tip: To create a flattering finish on your face after applying all your cosmetics, spray a miro-fine mist of water on your face. You can buy a can of aerosol Evian, or you can get a travel-sized bottle for hairspray and fill it from your Britta or other filtered water.  This makes your face look more youthful by putting a microscopic dew layer on the surface that is present in young skin, in the light your skin and face will look fresher and more natural.",1392681600,2014-02-18
1.0,"I wanted to like this, I really did.  The description sounded intriguing, and I love scents with pepper and sandalwood as notes.  The bottle is interestingly shaped, and holds a generous amount of scent.

I open the package, remove the rounded square bottle, take off the cap and spray lightly in the air, walking through the mist.  I smell nothing but generic CK scent-vaguely artificial and synthetic.  A few minutes later I begin to get a headache.  I try again the next day, and the same thing happens.  It lingers on clothing and the skin, lasting through a shower, or several days in the closet (some spray got on a sweater).  I let my daughter try it, and thank goodness she went to school shortly after, as even on someone else it was triggering a headache.

I am glad that so many people like this scent, it just is not for me.  I cannot give it to my daughter to use, unless I want to move out of my house.  I will dispose of this as soon as I am able.",1424476800,2015-02-21

4.0,"This review is for the Dermablend Intense Powder Camo Powder Foundation. This product is marketed as a blendable and buildable powder foundation that is not cakey. This pressed powder features Camo Pigments, a high level of pigment that gives a full-coverage finish. You can apply the powder by using a beauty sponge or with a powder brush. Personally, I like to use my Elf kabuki powder brush to buff the powder on my face. You can finish by using a beauty sponge in the places where you need more coverage.

I typically wear liquid foundation everyday but wanted something more light for the summertime that can provide all-day wear. It went on smoothly, has fantastic coverage, and left a gorgeous natural finish. This powder lives up to its name. It is the most full-coverage powder foundation that I own. If you have acne, discoloration, birth marks, etc. that you want to cover up, then this is the product for you. It lasted the whole day and covered my hyperpigmentation. I would highly recommend this product.",1500249600,2017-07-17

4.0,"(PLEASE SEE UPDATE AT END)
Over time, I have had the opportunity to try out many different skin care items, a good amount of them very high end.  Some are good, others are excellent and once in a while there is a remarkable find.  For the most part, however, I find many to be of a good nature, but nothing remarkable.  This serum when used alone seems to fall into that area, but extended longer use might bring other changes, although I usually see results in this amount of time that I have had this product.

WHAT IS THIS SERUM LIKE?
Truffle Therapy is an interesting serum.  First of all, I was asked to try out the serum only, without the moisturizer.  The serum is designed to go with the moisturizer as a set, so that in itself does tend to make the serum at a disadvantage.  The bottle is a nice glass bottle which has a tight fitting metal cap on it.  The pump is a good pump which allows for a small amount of serum to be dispensed should you desire that.  It is not permanent on the bottle, it can be unscrewed.  The bottle is darkened to protect the serum from light.  You can still see through it slightly to tell how much is left, or you can unscrew the top if you desire.

The serum itself is a creamy white color.  It is not watery, but thick enough to put some on your fingertip and then apply.  It is not too watery.  The serum has a unique fragrance.  It seems to remind most of us of coconut with Hawaiin Sandalwood with a twist of something else slightly smoky (perhaps truffle?)

DOES THIS HAVE SUNSCREEN?
I want to point out that this serum does not have SPF in it which I LOVE.  If I want to wear sunscreen, I would rather use what I want to.  I often react poorly to many different sunscreens so this is a big plus for me.

HOW DOES THIS SERUM PERFORM?
Again, this is designed to go with the matching moisturizer but on its own, the serum is easy to apply quickly.  One pump of the cap will cover my entire face.  You have to work quickly, however, because it does absorb into the skin right away.  It does not leave a residue, sticky feeling, or any kind of greasy feeling.  In fact, once soaked in, the skin feels almost drier than when started, if that makes sense.

As for appearance, I have not seen much difference in creases/wrinkles after using it a while.  I do see a glow to the skin and a tighter feeling, however, so that is as promised on the box.  The fragrance is borderline irritating to me- it is quite strong and can make me feel like I wish it was not so strong some days.  It does fade, but takes some time.  If you are sensitive to smells, that could be an issue.  I don't dislike it, but at times, it feels a bit overpowering.

What I am still not sure about is how this serum makes my face feel tighter and almost drier than before I applied it.  That is a strange feeling to me after using a serum.  When combined with a natural moisturizer (not this one) it does counteract that feeling, however.  Using a moisturizer does seem to enhance the glow of the skin. but moisturizers do that on their own somewhat anyway.

THE BOTTOM LINE
This serum was given me to test alone, but with a moisturizer it does seem to give a nice glow to the skin and make it feel tighter.  Alone it feels like it almost makes my skin feel drier than before I applied it.  The fragrance is a bit intense which could be a concern if you happen to not like it much.  It takes some time to fade.  It is reminiscent of the coconut smell at a crowded beach.

This seems to be a good serum, but for the price, I am thinking that I will give it four cautious stars- really being more like three and a half.  I realize that truffles are expensive and since that is what is supposed to be the ingredient that is a main feature of the serum, the price is expected to be higher.  I will continue to use up the bottle and see if I have any other experiences to add to this review.  If I do, I will update.  In all fairness, some serums or skin care products do take a bit more time than others to show dramatic changes.  If I experience any, I will adjust my review accordingly.

UPDATE
I have had the opportunity to test out this serum once again with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skin-and-Co-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Cream-1-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B00GB2CNJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skin and Co Roma Truffle Therapy Cream, 1 Fluid Ounce</a>.  I must say that this completely changes the performance of this serum.  Used together, the effects are much better and I like it a lot more.  This makes a great duo for summer as it absorbs quickly but leaves skin moisturized and very smooth and ready for makeup.

The combination would be great for all skin types in summer and probably more for normal to oily in the winter.

4.0,"I am really enjoying this little guy! I have been looking for something smaller than the average urban decay naked palette ( size wise) to travel with. I would give is 5 stars but for me 5/5 would be my perfect palette, and this is not. The quality is amazing (as to be expected). They are very buttery, blend well and highly pigmented. But for me this isn't the only palette I would have to bring with me if I were traveling (which is why I wanted this palette.) For me personally it is messing a shimmery taupe grey and a golden champagne shade. I find traveling wish a massive palette a waste of space and always on the hunt for a smaller palette that meets all my needs. This is as close as I have come. I do not regret this purchase at all, perfected for those that love that golden/glowing goddess look. Which I myself love. And for a high end brand this was a steal at only 15$!",1412035200,2014-09-30
3.0,"This is a hydrating oil that contains, along with some good quality ingredients like rosehip seed oil, squalene (not sure if vegetable source or not), and jojoba ""esters,"" also has a few emulsifiers and known irritants, including parfum (meaning it is synthetic scent, not an essential oil). Since I am very well acquainted with the properties and costs of high-end skin care and essential oils, I can give my opinion that the produce is quite over-priced. The Vitamin C and some of the ingredients can help create a softer skin surface. The fragrance is strong to me and not unpleasant (like floral shampoo), but doesn't seem at all a natural scent and lingers. I have to cut it to not find it annoying, as I do not use any artificial fragrances other than what are in a few of my very selectively chosen niche perfumes (that do not smell like shampoo).  I am not sure why so many chemical ingredients were deemed necessary in a serum of this sort, and feel that for the money, one would be much better off with a high-quality organic CO2 rosehip seed oil, which I have seen work miracles! For extra boost, you can add other known skin-saving oils like prickly pear seed, argan, marula, olive oil squalene, pomegranate seed oil and many essential oils which are known to benefit skin, and which I would recommend over this formula.",1483142400,2016-12-31

5.0,"Don't let the packaging turn you away - Jack Black Epic Moisture Clean Cream Body Wash may be aimed at men, but it has such a delightfully gender neutral scent that anyway can use it. It smells faintly of ginger and lemon in a deliciously subtle way. Not overpoweringly cologne-esque like some men's products.

But beyond smelling great, it also works great. I felt fresh and clean but my skin felt moisturized and refreshed, not tight and dry. I didn't even feel the intense need to apply lotion after stepping out of the shower like I normally do. I love finding products that my husband and I can share - I think it is absurd to have to have gendered cleaning products, but that's the economy we live in - but I'm willing to have separate products if they work particularly well.

4.0,"I'm a huge Bliss Spa fan.  I've been using their heavenly Lemon + Sage Body Butter for years and recently discovered the Incredi-Peel Glycolic Pads (which easily rival Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel Pads for almost fifty percent less).  So I'm surprised it took them so long to release a line of color cosmetics.  Naturally, I was eager to give them a go.

Although I'm not a big user of bronzer, I'm also not very outdoorsy.  So sometimes it's nice to have a little color during the summer when everyone else has gotten a rosy glow from a day at the beach.  I've never tried the gold-standard of bronzers - Guerlain's Terracotta (which is a perpetual fixture on every magazine's annual ""Best Of"" list) because I wouldn't get enough use out of it to justify spending upwards of $50.  I have tried Physician's Formula (too dry and frosted) and Sephora's Sun Disk (too matte and orange), so I have those to compare this against.

This product creates an attractive, subtle glow.  It isn't too brown (which can read as dirt), nor too orange (otherwise known as the Lohan/Trump-effect), but has a natural rosy undertone that makes it flattering on my fair skin (with yellow undertones).  It goes on very smooth and almost creamy, similar to mineral foundations.  The only thing that was a bit startling is that, in lieu of frost, it actually has little bits of sparkle.  When first applied, they appear quite obvious which, for someone my age, is not particularly desirable.  However, after it settled into my skin, the sparkles were nearly invisible.  Still, I'd recommend a judicious application, because the sparkle/glitter effect looked okay on my cheekbones, nose ridge and over my forehead, but kind of weird above my lip.

Overall, I'd say this lives up to the Bliss reputation.  An easy way to create that healthy summer glow.",1468195200,2016-07-11

5.0,"I'm not a huge wearer of fragrance. The last time I bought perfume was way back when Cherry Vanilla was popular about 15 years ago and I still have some left. And it smells just as good today as it did the day I bought it. I am very sensitive to fragrances. Especially cloyingly sweet or musky fragrances. If I am near someone wearing a strong musky fragrance, I have to move away or I will get nausea and a headache. I really hate when you can smell someone whi is a good 10 feet away from you and they smell like they have not showered byt instead layered perfume on them layer over layer over layer. Yuck. Not all fragrances bother me, though. I like light citrusy scents. And a light floral scent as long as it isn't too heavy.

I decided to try this because it is Eau de Toilette, which is usually lighter than Eau de Parfum, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did.

This Burberry Brit Sheer has a light floral fragrance that isn't at all overpowering and I find that I can wear it without any ill effects. The scent is floral, yet fruity, but not cloyingly sweet or musky. I very much enjoy the fragrance and wore it to my allergy doctor appointment today and was complimented on it.

As I said, I rarely have occasion to wear fragrance, so this bottle should last me another 15 years or so. It's a very nice fragrance and I'm glad I decided to try it.",1445558400,2015-10-23

5.0,"I am not big on foundation, and I don't usually wear a lot of makeup. Japonesque Velvet Touch Foundation (shade 05) was a near perfect match for my skintone and texture from the beginning.  This foundation goes on smoothly, blends easily and you don't feel like you are wearing makeup at all.  Almost always I brush a translucent powder over any foundation that I wear. I didn't need to do t is with the Japoneseque Velvet Touch foundation.

The look is flawless and it stayed all day even under conditions such as under tv studio lighting which can be really harsh.  I would definitely recommend it.",1415491200,2014-11-09
5.0,"Really love this.  It is a white whipped cream the consistency of Noxema.  Very generous jar this is no sampler size!  Has a light, very fresh clean scent, barely there.  Goes on silky smooth with leaving a healthy glow, not a greasy shiny look.  Gives a very slight tingly fresh feeling to your face and neck that lasts a very long time. Does not pull or tighten.  Softens lines and gives your face a healthy clean feeling and sheen.  I'm not expecting a face-lift, at age 55 I just want my wrinkles to relax and soften and to help my dry skin.  This product absolutely performs!",1453161600,2016-01-19
2.0,"At first spritz, the scent is a weak citrus that didn't really impress me.  It just didn't seem to have any depth, just a single, non-descript citrus note which I couldn't identify as lemon, lime, orange or grapefruit.  Immediately after spraying, I asked my husband, sitting 2 feet away, how he liked it and he said he couldn't smell anything at all.  After 30 minutes, the scent was completely undetectable even while inhaling deeply from my wrist.  Good thing I didn't really care for the scent in the first place.",1491264000,2017-04-04
5.0,"I originally came across this product while living in canada and was so excited when I discovered it here on Amazon. I have very dry skin and this is a great cream. Not heavy at all, a very light fragrance that i enjoy and it is great as a foundation primer.",1471564800,2016-08-19
5.0,"I use this shampoo, along with the matching conditioner, and these two products have absolutely transformed my hair.  My hair is highlighted, color treated with permanent color and I also heat style several times a week, so dryness and breakage are always an issue.  This formula has stopped the breakage and has definitely made my hair more resilient.  It has also helped with the dryness because it contains oils and emollients that hydrate really nicely.  If your hair is weak and damaged from chemical processing and/or heat styling, you can't do better than Strength Cure.  It also smells amazing, although the scent dissipates quickly.  My colorist has definitely noticed a difference in the condition of my hair and when I told him what I was using, he agreed that this formula is awesomely wonderful.  He said he can always tell when his clients use Pureology.  I was using the Essential Repair formula but it was discontinued and Strength Cure is the replacement formula.  It's just as great as Essential Repair perhaps even better.  My hair is soft, strong and shiny now when before it was dry, frizzy and wouldn't respond well to my styling efforts.  It looks amazing now and I get compliments on it all the time.  This formula is color safe and a little goes a long way, so these bottles last a lot longer than you might think at first glance.  Yes, it's expensive but it's so worth it.  I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS that I've wasted countless dollars on.  So I have no problem paying  a premium price for something that actually lives up to its claims.  And this Pureology formula does just that.  If you have damaged hair, this is the perfect formula that can remedy that situation and transform your hair into something gorgeous and beautiful.  It worked its magic for me and it can do the same for you.  I highly recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.  They work beautifully together.  However, I wouldn't purchase these products on Amazon, where fakes abound.  Buy them at Ulta or somewhere else where you can return them if you don't like them.  There are too many unscrupulous people on Amazon who are desperately trying to make a buck by ripping off unsuspecting people.  Don't take the chance.  Buy these products from a reputable online store or from a salon.  You will have no recourse if you receive a fake you've bought on Amazon.  Don't waste your money.  Saving a few bucks is not worth it if you receive a counterfeit product.",1462838400,2016-05-10
4.0,"I'm 42 years old and have some light wrinkles and the occasional dark circles. I have used this for 2 weeks now and I can't really see any difference. I have decided to pass this on to mom who is 65 and see if she falls in love. For now, I have given it a 3 star review for it being a natural choice in a world full of chemicals in a bottle and for its unique applicator tip that keeps me from having to buy other things to apply it with.

Update 11/22/14: I never passed it on to mom (sorry Mom!).  After using it awhile longer, I have raised my star rating to a 4. I can see some small improvements in the fine wrinkles around the outer edges of my eyes. It is not dramatic, but it is something. I will keep using it and update my review again. I am more hopeful now!",1415232000,2014-11-06
3.0,"This Zwilling J.A. Henckels 5-Piece Grooming Set comes packaged in a nice heavy black box with minimal markings on the outside. The inside of the box looks remarkably like the cover of a romance novel, perhaps one with vampires. That was unusual, and surprising. I guess it adds some interest, but I think the packaging would be classier looking without it.

Inside the box you will find first a lightweight pouch with a flap protecting a very nice looking leather zipper case. These are described as tools for men, but I'm not sure why. Each and every one of the five tools inside can be used by women as well. The tools are nice looking and a most of them are a good weight. The nail clippers are different from any that I have seen before, and frankly they seem to be not only the tool most often used, but they don't seem to be sturdy enough to last long. I may be wrong, but they are lightweight and fold flat. That is a nice feature, but it is also what makes me a bit leery about their long term use. They are also rather small for a man's hand in my opinion.

All in all, I think this is a nice set. It would make a nice gift for anyone who travels, or who likes to have nice looking grooming tools. Perhaps I am missing something, but aside from the case, I don't feel that these are much different from grooming tools that you can purchase almost anywhere. I am certain of one thing, you will be paying mostly for branding here.",1432771200,2015-05-28
4.0,"I tested some of this self tanner on my arm. It has been about an hour and I can only see where my skin has plumped from the moisturizer. The color looks brighter where I applied the tanner. I like the smell of the product, it has a much nicer smell than most self-tanners. Since this is a gradual tanner, I most likely won't see too much change in color until it has been used for a week or two. I am not a tanner, in fact, I burn quite easily and am prone to skin cancer. This product does not have sunscreen, so if you go outdoors, you will still need that protection applied. I do love the smell and how nicely it applies and how where it is applied, the skin looks better",1493510400,2017-04-30

Their other products have really impressed me but this face wash burned my eyes so badly  even without getting it directly in them, just in the normal course of washing my face.  It also left my skin really really clean which may sound great but I couldn't help but feel it was stripping my skin of every single bit of moisture.  I swear my skin would make a squeaking noise when I rubbed my finger over it after using this.
So, no thank you, I would like to keep my moisture barrier.",1486684800,2017-02-10

4.0,"This is very good makeup. It's not great makeup, but it has a large palette with many varieties, and most would enjoy it.

Pros:
- Like the more tame colors. They spread easily, and work pretty well.
- It's a bit powdery, so not as good as better makeup. For the price, however, it is very competitive.

Cons:
- The sparkly ones are a bit too sparkly. If you're 21 and going out - they'd be a better fit than for a career woman.

Overall, good, but not as good as Urban Decay.",1445299200,2015-10-20
4.0,"Dermablend Quick-Fix is a quick way to hide blemishes or tattoos. It is perfect for occasional use when you need temporary coverage. Application is easy with the lipstick style stick - just apply with light-to-medium pressure and blend lightly with your finger till it matches the surrounding skin. You can add an additional application if required. Without the powder, for normal skin, expect to re-apply about twice in an 8 hour day. On the go application is not an issue with the compact stick.

3.0,"I was originally introduced to makeup setting spray when I was having my makeup done by a professional for an event. She used Urban Decay's All Nighter and made me enough of a believer to go out and buy it for myself.  For everyday makeup application I don't use it because I am acne prone and try to use as few products on my face as possible, but for special events it is fantastic and really does increase the longevity of my makeup.  (Which I appreciate because I have very dry skin and even with primer for both my skin and eyelids, makeup never seems to last as long on me as other people.)  Unfortunately I don't like this product as much.  It does seem to feel similar on my skin once applied but the biggest difference to me is in the kind of mist.  With the All Nighter the mist is very fine and seems to just lightly coat my skin.  With this, unless I hold this quite far away from my face it seems like a very strong mist.  (And if I hold it further away from my face, it's harder to control it from going in my hair.  I don't hate this and it's possible I might be fine with it had I not tried the Urban Decay version first, but I personally prefer that version.  This is especially true since both seem similarly priced.  I do though wish with both products they were more transparent about whether it is okay for acne prone skin.",1415232000,2014-11-06

5.0,"I was skeptical about the vanilla scent and the ""juicy"" descriptive name. But it's a fine perfume. It's actually a sexy perfume, and that's not something I'd say about many perfumes.

This complex scent hints of a sophisticated female vampire. It's not like female pheromones but rather a seductive foreign physical presence combined with an undead voice - really messes with one's head. I don't know if one is meant to be consumed by the wearer or if it's the other way around.",1457308800,2016-03-07
4.0,"This is an opaque light pink polish that isn't sheer.  It requires two coats. The first coat didn't go on very smoothly, I would have preferred a bigger brush, but the second coat evened it out.  I have another Butter London polish, a purple orchid shade, that went on much easier than this one.  However, it does last quite a while without chipping.  I don't think this formula is in any way superior to Essie polish though, and Essie is almost half the price.  The color is very pretty, perfect for spring and summer.  I wear it with a gold confetti topcoat, which helps the polish last nearly a full week without a chip.  When I do get a chip, I simply add another layer of the confetti polish, without removing the pink base coast underneath.  I didn't want a sheer look this time and this polish certainly delivered an opaque finish.  It's also quite shiny.  I used the Seche Vita topcoat, which not only dries the polish quickly, it helps it last longer.  I apply the clear topcoat every few days.which keeps the finish shiny and the chips to a minimum.  All in all, I'm giving this polish four stars because the first coat was rather spotty, although the second one delivered a flawless finish..",1430956800,2015-05-07

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.

3.0,"I must admit that I do have baldness which is pretty obvious. I have thinning of hair in the back of the head as well as in the center. When I got the opportunity to try this review sample I was excited that *May be* I might see some new life to my rather sparse hair on my head. I started using this product as directed and noticed that each day I used it I started getting headache so I had to stop. I am certainly having some reaction to the ingredients and did not want to take any risk further. Reading the reviews from others here on Amazon it does not seem to indicate anyone else is having headache issues? Anyways, I have decided that I will give couple of weeks of break before I attempt this product again.

Just like another reviewer here on Amazon I too experienced the same rattling sound wherein when this rather attractive box arrived and I first opened it the tiny vials were scattered all over the inside of the box. Surely the manufacturer must consider taking this feedback and review the packaging style. Maybe provide a smaller box or a foam insert to secure the vials in the box. Luckily for me none of the vials were broken.

I am force to rate this with three stars based on the experiences that I encountered. I am willing to give this another try in couple of weeks and revise my rating.",1502064000,2017-08-07
3.0,"I've used this for a month, and given that my skin is in bad shape from swimming and outdoor abuse in winter, I was curious to see if this could help clean things up. It certainly is a good moisturizer, and there was no odor or irritation that went on from the application. The cream itself isn't thick and absorbed in rather nicely to my skin. My better half recognized that my skin was getting better, so that felt good (it's always nice to have them notice without being prompted.)

So I like this. A lot. But the price...

I generally have no problems spending money to get a quality product, but at $100/oz, it is a luxury I can't really justify. When compared to my normal moisturizers (Neutrogena is what I've normally used off and on), I just can't notice the difference. If I did notice a difference, I'd definitely consider it (but the ""feel good"" to cost ratio would have to scale accordingly.) Bottom line: if you can afford this regularly, then go for it. If you're trying to mind your wallet, there are a lot cheaper alternatives that come close to doing the job.",1486944000,2017-02-13
5.0,"For anyone who knows about the best high end kitchen knives, you will know the name of Zwilling/ J.A. Henckels. Zwilling knives are the best knives I know of, that last a life time and beyond. Zwilling is German for Gemini- the twins- named for Henckel's twin edge blades that could slice through a single hair when they were first made in the 1700's. These knives and other kitchen utensils and personal grooming sets are still being made today with the high quality and standards that Zwilling has always been known for. The only difference is very few of their pieces are actually made in Germany now like in the beginning when Peter Henckels first starting making kitchen utensils and straight edge razors in 1731 in Germany.

This Twinox Mountain stainless steel 3 piece grooming set contains personal grooming scissors with curved tips to avoid injuries, nail clippers in a sleek award winning design, a nail file and a leather case to keep them all neatly put away. Having the case is a big plus for travel. The grooming scissors have a nice tight close cutting edge and a screw if they ever get loose for tightening. The nail clippers are the sleekest, flattest I have ever seen. The compact flat design won a European Award, and I can see why, as it's design is very unique. To open the clippers, you pull back on the ridges, lift the bar and push it forward. It's now ready to clip and you will have to get used to a different cut with these clippers. Unlike the curved nail clippers that I have always used, these are much flatter and straight- making you clip in smaller segments. The huge plus after you get used to cutting different than the curved clippers, is the nail clippings don't fly all over the room, they actually stay inside the clippers- that you can tap out into a waste can. It's a whole different nail clipping experience.

The nail file has a nice pointed end- though not a sharp point and the 2 sides have different textures for filing- one side is rough, the other finer- like rough and fine sand paper. All 3 pieces are made of stainless steel, so even if they get wet after you shower and use these- no rust! Every piece has the Zwilling (twin) trademark, even the nice leather case that snaps closed and has a slot for each of the 3 pieces. The thin 4"" x 2"" case is ideal for travel. The box says the pieces are made in Germany, Italy, India and China, so I contacted Zwilling and asked which country these pieces are made from and they said- all of them. The scissors- Germany, nail file- Italy, clippers- China and case- India. Once you get used to the very different flatter nail clipper, you will like not having to pick up nail clippings all over the room. Like the Zwilling high end kitchen knives, this 5 STAR three piece personal grooming kit will last a long time with it's high end materials and for travel it can't be beat.",1451692800,2016-01-02
3.0,"I have tried the Juice Beauty Clearing Serum before and one of my sons used it regularly. We both loved it. So it was with great eagerness to try out this whole kit. The only thing we both like out of this entire kit is the clearing serum. That hasn't changed. The other stuff? It's ok. The moisturizer tends to be too watery for me. He says he likes it. He really likes the cleanser as well, but the moisturizer isn't all that special for him. He didn't try the peel, but I did and along with the moisturizer, the peel tends to make my skin burn a little bit.

It did help prevent acne from getting worse though neither one of us have acne, just sensitive skin. It smells great. It feels great and for the price, it is a good deal. I just think the moisturizer needs to be a bit thicker rather than runny. The peel? I can do without.

It is a good kit price and it might work for some people but we really like the serum and the cleanser the best. It does leave your face feeling clean.",1440547200,2015-08-26

I ordered some for myself to get rid of the brown spot on my cheek.

Day 1- applied it using a brush morning and night. felt a slight sting both times and area turned red. i put the gel on after i toned and moisturized my skin

day 2-applied morning at night again. stung a bit more and turned red. again kept my daily skin routine

day 3- spot was dark red when i woke up and slightly sensitive. applied morning at night. stung. again still cleansed and moisturized my face (you put the gel on after all of that)

day 4- woke up to a nasty dark scab on my check. kinda of panicked but continued to use it twice a day. it burned

day 5-woke up convinced i was scarred for life. the patch was dry and dark and very hard to cover with make-up. i applied it once more at night and only left it on for twenty minutes.

day 6-no more using the gel. kept my same routine and put vitamin E oil on it twice a day. it was so dark and i ended up calling a dermatologist convinced i made it worst.

day 7- more vitmain E and cover up. no using gel. almost cried looking in the mirror

day 8-dark patch super dry. looked closely in the mirror and realized it was starting to flake. applied more vitamin E

day 9- the scab came off and the spot was 80% lighter. omg the heavens opened up and i was sparred. still applying vitamin E though. So thankful. listen to your skin and be careful",1456876800,2016-03-02
4.0,"It actually works somehow!  We tested it by peeling an orange by hand, and even rubbing our hands in the Orange peels before washing. We did a before and after ""sniff"" test.  To use it, pretend it is a bar of soap, and rub it between your hands and fingers for 30-40 seconds under running water. After 30 seconds, we could still smell some orange, but we ran it for another ten seconds, and the odor was gone!  Only the slightest hint of orange lingered on our hands. The stainless steel ""soap bar"" smelled the way it did when it was first taken out of the box.  I am not sure how this works, but it does. There was no residue or any indication that the ""bar"" had been treated with anything, or that it released any liquid, etc.  It appears to just be a blob of stainless steel shaped to look like a bar of soap, but it works at taking away odors from hands!",1418169600,2014-12-10
1.0,"The description says ""can be used with or without water,"" so I tried it both ways.  Without water left my skin feeling greasy, so I began rinsing it off.  Unfortunately, neither method was good for my skin.  Shortly after I began using this cleanser, my skin broke out--a lot.  I then began using the 3-in-1 simply as a makeup remover and then using my regular skincare regimen after.  That's how I discovered that this cleanser was actually leaving a lot of makeup behind which is probably why I was breaking out so much.  Although I like the milky feel when putting it on, this product simply doesn't work for my skin.",1455148800,2016-02-11

4.0,I found this product to be just fine. I love the brush and product in one applicator idea but found it hard to control the product at first. The dot that comes out on the applicator just kind of globbed in one spot but a little practice with the built in applicator distributed the illuminator right where I wanted it. I used moisturizer to thin it out and I also used foundation on another area. Both worked but defeated the ease of the one step application. Used alone as intended a light touch works best. When I used this on myself I did not see a big difference perhaps because I was in bright bathroom light and critically looking for a difference. When I tried it on my daughter and then saw her in normal light across a room at a party she glowed.,1449792000,2015-12-11

3.0,"The concealer itself is nice and easy to use. Like other La Roche-Posay products I've used, when I first see it I'm sure it's too dark for my light skin color, but once applied it evens out and blends in very well. The consistency is a bit thick. I don't like the brush application. You have to twist it to get it to come out, and I got way too much out on the first try, and trying to brush it on with the small little brush didn't work well for me at all. I ended up blending it in with my fingers and then it worked well. I like La Roche-Posay products overall, but the pen doesn't work well for me",1492732800,2017-04-21
5.0,"This gives a cover that really does 'blur' on the skin. The texture is somewhere between a very soft and smooth sand, and silicon. It lays on your skin  instead of staining it. If you use any other cosmetic products, I think this should go above and not below. I have olive, slightly tanned skin and this gives a nice blurred highlight to my skin and then, over time, seems to fade back a bit. There is no scent and a very little goes a very long way. You do not need much. I think there is just a bit more pigment in this product than the norm for BB creams. Overall a good product.",1445904000,2015-10-27
4.0,Excellent product; would buy again. I use a lot of Perricone products & found this moisturizer to be very good.

4.0,"This polish is a bright true orange with the perfect balance of red and yellow.  It is a classic summer shade and looks very nice either for a manicure or pedicure.  The first coat went on rather streaky and the second was a little less so, but still not perfect.  So I ended up having to do three coats (in addition to a base coat).  I did use a quick dry top coat but it still took a full 30 minutes before I felt free to resume normal movement, lol!  This brand of polish wears pretty well.  It's been 5 days since my manicure and I only have some minimal wear on the tips, but no chips.  I was lucky enough to purchase this color at TJ Maxx for $5, a true bargain.  I have other Butter London polishes I have paid full price for, so I was happy to find it so cheaply.  I know that this formula is free of a number of traditional nail polish chemicals, and that's fine, as long as it doesn't effect the hardiness of the polish in general.  I have no issues with the health of my nails, and I wear them short and neat, so I'm not too terribly concerned about it. I have an extensive nail polish collection but didn't have a bright true orange so I'm glad I was able to pick this one up.  It looks great with summer clothing.  I'm giving this polish four stars because the first two coats were so streaky.  But by the third coat, the look was smooth and shiny and in general, the polish has worn well.  I definitely recommend this color and Butter London in general.  However, if you're not concerned about the chemical factor, Essie polish wears just as well for half the price.",1434499200,2015-06-17

5.0,"The LOreal Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  They earn being in a high-end category in my opinion. They do not seem to be scented or too chemical. The jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups. I have many favorites among them, yet I believe they all stand very well on their own.

I hope it is going to be efficient to review all of the ones I know of here, and including compatible products along the way. Respectively:

1. DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF):
2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF):
3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF):

5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO (NO SPF):

7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25):
8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)

I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.

I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

1. DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CR&Egrave;ME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF):
This is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.

My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have sun spots. Now I get it.  This particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  It is lovely.

If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when I apply it with dab it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.

The other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.  She has said that even in my home with shades closed I am exposing my skin to potential damage.  I score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

The two colors I have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored LOreal Dermablend Pro products with them.

Ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF):
needed. The wonderful cr&egrave;mes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the cr&egrave;me, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using them together:

 Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose. A. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of cr&egrave;me I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr&egrave;me and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000 for me.

I have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself.
Pick your poison, as I have purchased some powder and cr&egrave;me blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.

I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.
One thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.

3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF):
These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple.

4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION!! (25 SPF):
This a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the variable built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Cr&egrave;me, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

Not only can I variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. This shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the cr&egrave;me, and the powders, I may experiment with altering the look as in 2A.  Win-Win-Win.  I also may add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.

5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF):
This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  I do know that is stretching it. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!

6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY!! (NO SPF):
Wow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have!  Double win!

This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which I won't feel shy about adding puffs of Dermablend Professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and I will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2A.  This is a lovely product.  I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. Love.

7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25):
It is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.

8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)
This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn.  It covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000, and very smart.

Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!",1499040000,2017-07-03
5.0,"DJ Play That Song is a semi-neon purple color with red undertones. I say semi because it's not a blazing neon. It can be worn to work. It looks just like it is pictured in the bottle - pinkish purple. I tried to take pics after applying but my camera wouldn't capture the real color. I tried in sun/shade/indoors/lights.. but didn't work. The color is really pretty to naked eye.

Saturday Disco Fever is a bright pure orange color. This is not a very blazing neon, so I am able to wear it to work. It looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors. I felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in Summer. I was a little apprehensive at first because I personally don't like Yellow/Orange shades. But this color worked for me. It is more red-toned than yellow-toned. This dark Orange looks good on nails too.

The formula on both the polishes is great. Two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish. They dry quickly but dry matty-ish. So top coat is a must for me. I applied a base coat (OPI Base Coat), 2 coats of polish and a top coat (OPI Top Coat). They lasted more than a week on me which is rare :-).",1371600000,2013-06-19

2.0,"I purchased this item directly from the manufacturer, so I know it was genuine. I was super excited to try this product bc it looked so exciting and different. I also loved the potential anti-aging effects with this item. BUT...the big but is whether or not it cleans better than my Clarisonic Mia. It doesn't. I alternated using the Mia one night and the Luna the next night, several nights in a row. Whenever I used my Luna, my face still had grime on it - it was not as clean as the nights I used my Mia.

Also, I find it an oddly shaped and designed device for the face - it's hard to get it to fit everywhere. It's basically like taking a flat-ish rock and trying to clean your face with the tip of that rock. Not always a good fit.

For now, I'm sticking with my Mia and will be returning the Luna until the design is much improved....they should've waited to bring this product to market, in my opinion; it's just not up to par as the excellent face-cleaner that it's meant to be and marketed as.",1455667200,2016-02-17

5.0,"A few minutes ago, as I was preparing to sit down to write this review, my husband admitted to me that he was curious about these products and had used the breast firming cream on the loose skin under his chin.  He's impressed!  I've been using it as well - mostly in the areas of my d&eacute;colletage  and we have both noticed the firming up of that skin.  It's a cool gel that goes on with little fragrance.  I use a single pump on my neck and collar area and work it in until it has fully absorbed.  You can even feel a tightening sensation.  I would recommend the ""breast serum"" very highly to anyone who is interested in toning up those tender skin areas under the chin.  It would also benefit those who have recently lost weight and have a little bit of extra skin to contend with every day.  I give this half of the review 5+ stars.

The Stretch Mark Prevention cream is very nice too - but I don't know how revolutionary it is.  It has a stronger fragrance than the bust cream and goes on smoothly with fast absorption.  It doesn't make your hands feel greasy.  The fragrance is a bit much when used on the top part of the body - it's easier to take if you keep in the belly, saddle and upper thigh area.  It contains agents that help promote your skin to manufacture collagen and encourages elasticity.  It also has shea butter in it to moisturize the skin.  A regular routine using high quality ingredients like these should help reduce or eliminate stretch marks.  I would give this product 4 stars on its own.

Overall, this is a great set that would make a wonderful gift to a newly expectant mother.",1491091200,2017-04-02

5.0,"I tried this product after success with other pca products. I use this cleanser in the morning and I use the pigment bar in the evenings. I have done this for 6 weeks now and I can truly see a difference in my complexion. My skin is less oily and much clearer. I like this combination because it seems to combat my acne along with scaring from older scars. I say this is a good first step into the PCA product line.

5.0,"I thought I'd be scarred for life by the self tanning experiences of my tween and teen years (90's to early 00's).  I have a distinct memory of a Bath & Body Works self-tanner turning me into a streaky orange mess.  Thankfully self-tanners have evolved A LOT since then with easier application and more natural results.

Prior to receiving this I'd tried (and liked) Vita Liberata's Fabulous Self Tanning Gradual Lotion but was more excited to try this variety because I like quicker results and find tinted mousses to be the most user friendly from an application perspective.

To apply this, you first cleanse and exfoliate your skin.  (I also like to shave my legs first.)  But you DON'T use any in-shower moisturizers or apply any lotions, creams or moisturizers after showering.  You towel dry your skin.  Then, you apply to your skin with a mit (not included) in long circular motions, going easy around the elbows, knees, hands and feet.  The foam is tinted which makes it easier to make sure you don't miss a spot.  (Though I still like help from someone else to get between my shoulders and to my mid-back and make sure I'm even all over where I can't see.)  You then need to wait 4-8 hours for your tan to develop, though the mousse dries pretty quickly lessening the chances it rubs off.  (Though whenever possible I still like to wear dark, loose fitting clothing and eschew undergarments whenever I can just to be safe.)

I will say that nailing self tanner is a combo of technique + formula and I've product-agnostic I've definitely gotten better at this the more I've gotten a feel for it.  That said, I do think this product is pretty great.  It glides on smoothly and evenly and without a strong odor.  It dries quickly as advertised and develops into a beautiful, natural glow that makes my permanently pasty skin beach ready.  As someone who is more pale I would prefer a lighter color for winter use (this particular line doesn't come in light/fair, though their phenomenal line does and their gradual line allows for a light glow as it is buildable), but I like this for the summer time.  I also find as long as I take good care of my skin while using this (minimizing the number of hot showers I take, limiting pool time and patting my skin dry vs. rubbing) I do get 5-7 days of wear out of one tan.

I'm a fan!",1470614400,2016-08-08

4.0,"I'm fair/cool and normally when I select a new foundation to try I pick the shade next to the lightest of all shades, and it's almost always a good match.  Not with this shade, Cream 10N. It's like I've transformed into a vampire unless I put a light dusting of bronzer over it. Otherwise it's a good foundation. It's a neutral tone and not too yellow, not too pink. I use a slightly damp Takelon make-up brush but I put it on so sparingly I'm not sure if I'm getting the full effects of the SPF 25. I'm sensitive to scent and there is none. It covers my freckles across my cheeks & nose and a couple darker age spots with ease. I recommend going a shade darker than you normally do...maybe even 2 shades. I have slightly dry skin in the summer, and while this isn't moisturizing, it's not too drying either.

3.0,"Ok, I'm 57 years old. Maybe this foundation is for younger women. That said, I had higher hopes for it. It is illuminating, but with sparkles, which I didn't want (thought they were not noticeable on my face, I saw them on my forearms, where I had checked the color.) And not anywhere near enough coverage for my blotchy spots. And considering how thin the product is, it did stick on dry areas more than expected--but not more so than some (especially drugstore) foundations.

The color 20W was nice for my fair, but not pale, neutral (but on the cool side) coloring.

About the scent, it seemed off--or something. Don't know why that is, but I was a little concerned.

Will be returning. Still, I can see that this may be a great foundation for other skin and age types, and maybe the off-smell was a fluke for this particular order.",1446422400,2015-11-02
5.0,"I don't ever like feeling like I wasted money. I mean, I don't mind spending on lovely shoes or clothes if you get things like leather soles, fine details on seams, etc. Cosmetics can be tricky. I often do choose more costly makeup if the quality of it is superior to drug store brands (but lately the cheaper brands have been indeed upping their game!) They just apply more easily and last so much longer with less product than the cheaper stuff. I still will try anything, but won't rebuy unless it deserves it!

Lotions have never thrilled me. I mean they are fine and feel nice, but one rarely seemed to outperform another. So I just keep trying different ones thinking that ""maybe someday I will find the one."" I have tried things from La Mer all the way down to plain old petroleum jelly. Then, I usually feel stupid for spending what I did when I don't love the item.

Anyway, I didn't have any expectations that this was going to be any better than anything else. I must say though, that I was very surprised at how much I like this! It is a thick consistency. That quality is nice in a more expensive cream as you don't need as much product. I use less than a pea size for my whole face and neck, just tapping it in. It does not have a greasy consistency at all, you don't feel any sort of film on your skin with this. That is especially nice if you put it on before make up. I had something recently that would sort of peel off like bits of glue when my primer or foundation hit it. I retired that stuff for use on my hands and legs (yeah, I am still too cheap to pitch it! ha ha!!)

It isn't a big jar, and it the actual container is a smaller pot molded inside a larger jar, so look at the actual amount. 1.7 ounces. I would guess that the area of the cream is about the size 2 stacked oreos (sorry for the weird reference!) although the outside jar seems bigger. Still, you need only a little. I just sort of glide my finger over it, not ""dip"" into it. I could see this lasting for a long time...3 months if I had to guess, but I use it sparingly 2 times a day.

So for what you actually use, it isn't super expensive. I kind of wish it came in a prettier jar, so I could just leave it out on my vanity, but it has lots of writing and stuff all over it. I will sometimes use a stick of some kind to dip into cream if it gets lower in the jar. I don't like wasting it by getting it under my fingernail. Even the opposite end of a thin makeup brush makes an easy applicator. I have tiny makeup spatula that I use to scrape the last bits of product out of jars. Even sephora sometimes has little sticks and things that you can keep after testing something in a store. Those McDonald stirrers are also nice!

I am not sure if any lotion is truly ""anti"" aging. I mean, it still is just cream. But I really love the way it makes my skin feel (especially under my no-longer-25-year-old eyes and neck) and the way it absorbs so nicely in my skin. I imagine different types of skin could feel differently, but it is wonderful on mine. If I do notice some miraculous turnaround in my skin, I will definitely update my review. For now though, the smoothness of my skin and the absorption is something that I do love and that will make me buy again.

I really wish that I loved a 10 dollar cream as much! I think I have actually found a product that I will repurchase!",1524355200,2018-04-22

Im just not sure what it does, considering after the toner is used, I use the moisturizer (or serum, or peptide complex).  I couldn't tell a huge difference on days when I skipped the toner - though I could tell a difference when I skipped the moisturizer, serum, peptide complex, etc.  Anyway, if you like to use a toner, this is a good one - Im just not sold considering the price tag.",1487548800,2017-02-20

5.0,"I was flabbergasted at how this product works. I'd just come home after weeks in a physical rehab facility. Since my movement was impaired, I depended on the staff for washing with the hospital-like products there. As a result, my face had dried out terribly.

When I came home, I had this product waiting for me. After washing my face with my usual face soap, I dried it and applied it. It  was very strange. I was so dry that what I considered an amount that should spread all over one cheek was practically absorbed on contact. I kept rubbing and little rolls of dry skin formed. My dress looked as if I'd been caught in a shower of some weird little white worms. I repeated this process all over my face and was amazed at how soft it felt and how well it absorbed the moisturizer that I applied afterwards. I've never had a product that produced such results so quickly. The dead skin literally rolled off and fresh new skin was exposed. My skin feels so soft I frequently touch my face just to make sure I'm not imagining things.

The product advertises itself as a skin ""brightener."" I'm not exactly sure what brightening is, but as far as cleansing, cleaning, renewing, and softening this is certainly the best and fastest I have ever seen.

EDIT: No reflection on the product and I have not changed my mind on any of the above BUT there was a problem with the delivery mechanism whereby the pump no longer pumped up any product. I ended up having to (literally) cut up the bottle (Not easy--trust me--it's very hard plastic) but I didn't want to waste what felt like about half the contents. I don't know how this is supposed to work (some sort of vacuum action or something?) but there wasn't a tube and pumping did nothing. I got everything out using kitchen tools and so on, but there should be a dependable delivery system to make sure that you get out every last drop.",1511222400,2017-11-21
3.0,"For a product this expensive, there are some serious qualms I have, the first being the design flaws. When I spend $70 on a product, I expect a certain quality of packaging. The label is nociably faded on the pack, which is always an indication of future problems with a product. Aesthetics aside, let's get to the issue of the dropper and lid. Upon opening, a LOT of product spilled out. That was a bummer. I tried to use it again the next day and had a similar issue. I ended up transferring the product to a different glass bottle with a better dropper.

The second issue would be that I've been using this product for about 3/4 weeks now, and unfortunately I don't see a marked improvement in my skin. It smells really nice, and does create a nice base layer for my skincare routine, but my skin doesn't look any brighter or more plump than normal.

Maybe I need to keep using it longer, though I think 4-6 weeks is a fair amount of time to determine the efficacy of a product.

With products this expensive, people really try to convince themselves that they see a difference to justify the price. If it makes you feel better to use a high end product, go for it. If you want real results, perhaps look elsewhere.",1486857600,2017-02-12

I've tried expensive products (like Smashbox) and $10 and under drug store products (Cover Girl, Maybelline, etc.). I'd say this product is comparable in quality to a drug store product with the price of an expensive brand.

The product does go on very smoothly, and I think it will last a long time--a little bit goes a long way. But as far as coverage goes, it doesn't last through the day. For the last several days, I've applied my Cover Girl stick under one eye and the em cover up under the other eye. The em has a more yellow tinge, but once I put my foundation over it, the yellow disappears. By noon, the dark circles are completely back. I've come to expect it from a cheap product, but from a product that's nearly $20? That's unacceptable. Why would I pay twice the price to have the same result?

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

My 17 year old son just just finished Claravis, and his acne is clear, but his skin is still extremely reactive, scarred, and a mixture of dry and oily. I wanted to wait as long as possible to put him on Claravis, because I didn't want his growing affected, or any of the side effects. Claravis was a long, painful haul for him, but he got through it. There were two products that helped him keep his self esteem during the worst breakouts: Mario Badescu Drying Cream, and Mario Badescu Special Healing Powder. I have memories of him carefully applying this powder before his first date, before his proms, before his DECA competetions, before concerts and auditions...the yellow-toned powder counteracts redness extremely well, and the powder feels soothing, cooling, and it absorbs oil (and perspiration). The powder made his skin look better and his acne was much less noticeable. My son and I both find that sulfur is one of the best ingredients for our acne for drying the blemishes but not the skin. This powder has sulfur, and it also has Bismuth Subgallate, which is a hemostatic acent. Acne cysts often seep, and the Bismuth Subgallate in this helps control seepage, aids clotting, and corrects open sores. Kaolin Clay is excellent for healing acne scars. Zinc Oxide is a powerful acne fighter and a sunscreen as well. It calms skin and aids in barrier repair.
The actual ingredients list for this powder is: Talc, Bismuth Subgallate, Kaolin, Zinc Oxide, Calcium Carbonate, Magnesium Carbonate, Zinc Stearate, Sulfur.",1506211200,2017-09-24

5.0,"I've tried a few Juicy perfumes now and I've generally liked them.  This one is no exception!

It is definitely fruity at first (the top notes are listed elsewhere as apple, pear, and pomelo), but that mellows out later on.  After a few hours, I am left mostly noticing a bit of musk and vanilla (two of the base notes).  Since my favorite fragrances are musky, I'm happy with this.  (The middle notes are several different florals.  I think they blend well with everything else but aren't super noticeable with my body chemistry.)  I have to say, it's rare that I like a perfume at all points in time, but I like the fruitiness at first and I also like the musky/vanilla scent later.  It's also rare for a fragrance description to match exactly what happens with my body chemistry, but here it does!

The scent lasts about half a day but then needs to be reapplied.  This is about average performance, for me, for similar types of products.

Please note: Check seller feedback carefully before making a purchase, because large bottles of designer fragrance are sometimes counterfeited.  (Good seller feedback is an indication that people are happy with the seller, and therefore also an indication that the product you receive is likely to be genuine.)  Also note that this is a flammable liquid and can only be shipped ground, so it will take longer to arrive and returns will probably not be accepted.  Please plan your orders accordingly.

4.0,"Calvin Klein Eternity and Eternity Aqua are in my favorite perfumes collection. Aqua is perfect for summer time and Eternity Original is a classic that has stood the test of time.

Eternity Now is the latest in the Eternity collection. Like other Eternity fragrances it is on the softer side of fragrances but is quite long lasting unlike some other Calvin Klein fragrances like Reveal. It opens up with a floral and fruity bouquet and dries down to the seductive musk and cashmere. It is more flowery to my nose in the beginning and I can smell the peach blossom, although the top note is supposed to be Lychee. It's a nice floral which has a younger woman feel to it, but not too young.

Heart Notes - Peony, Peach blossom, Neroli
Base notes - Cashmere woods, Ambrox, Musk

Overall, I like this fragrance, I am going to use it a lot more in the summer as it smells more fresh and juicy to me - the spirit of Summer. However, it can be a mood booster on dark winter days.",1448582400,2015-11-27
5.0,My husband has never bought any product to help with the after shaving woes. He tried this product after a recent shave and declared it a miracle worker. This after-shave treatmentt helped soothe his irritated skin and did so without any burning feeling. He said his skin felt refreshed and on the road to feeling normal again. The product was non-greasy and alcohol-free which sounds like a great combo to me. We also both loved that it is fragrance free. I just might be stealing a bit of this product if I ever need it.,1494547200,2017-05-12
4.0,"This eye massager is a unique product, I have started incorporating it into my daily routine. I would suggest reading the instructions fully before using this product. To unlock the device, hold the + and - buttons down together for 3 seconds.  If you use eye serum, apply it before you use the massager. There is a detailed display in the quick start guide about how to apply the massager. The massager is made of a silicone like material that feels nice and soft against the skin. You can adjust the intensity of the pulsing to suit yourself. The massage itself feels great, you just move the massager along under the eye and along the brow bone for 30 seconds per eye. Be careful not to apply to the eye lid or eye ball. I can tell a reduction in under eye puffiness and dark circles after about a week of use.  Made in China.  If you do a search, youll find a video online as well, which may be helpful for you to get started.",1521331200,2018-03-18
5.0,"This is not just for men. I am a woman with long, curly hair and I love this product. It kind of reminds me of VO5 hairdressing, but this product is much thicker and waxier. It does not liquify in your hands when you rub them together (like the VO5 does), so it is a bit harder to distribute to your hair.
Nevertheless, it does a great job of smoothing down flyaways and giving a nice subtle shine to my hair. I only use just a touch so it really doesnt weigh down my hair or make it greasy.",1442275200,2015-09-15
5.0,"It was good, made my hair soft for days, thick formula, smelled nice. only complaint is that it only pumped out a little bit of product at a time and it was slow so I had to like pump it 10 times just  to get the amount of product I wanted. Other than that I would certainly recommend it for thicker hair.",1491523200,2017-04-07
5.0,"While I love the color and the makeup - this is hard to apply because the makeup mounds up in a ball.  Even with a large brush, it's hard to get the even coverage n the brush.  If the makeup was actually concave, it would be easier to apply.  I swirl my brush in the makeup and then tap the excess off before sweeping my cheeks.",1514073600,2017-12-24
5.0,"This is a wonderful product!  I have very dry skin and it is sensitive to many body creams plus I am allergic to most fragrances.

5.0,"I have been very pleased with this facial cleanser so far. This foams well. The foam is airy and light weight. It has a light, pleasant scent which doesn't over power your senses. The cleanser rinses cleanly. I have somewhat sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate at all. It doesn't sting my eyes either. This is a good, mild cleanser.",1525305600,2018-05-03
3.0,"This is a very thick very rich moisturizer specifically formulated for night time use. I must admit I did like the subtle floral smell. My wife liked it even more. In the dry months of winter this should come handy. You can apply Obagi Hydrate Luxe in the evening to combat skin dryness overnight to make your skin feel soft but not greasy at all. Little bit of researching this product's success on the web revealed that one of the ingredient called as 'Hydromanil' which is derived from the 'tara seeds' which people in Peru know about for ages and it is known to be a potent moisturizer. It is known to reduce skin water loss and have a rich moisturizing effect on the skin. If you love thick cream types of moisturizers and learn to apply using very little cream and spread it around you will find this adequate enough to combat dry skin.

So, why three stars? -
1. The acrylic jar which holds the cream while looks cool seems to dry out the cream as it does not seal properly if the top loose piece of plastic is removed.
2 - Yikes! it is very expensive for mere 48 grams of cream forcing me to rate it with 3 stars!

Side note: Buying directly from Amazon (which clearly says ""Shipped and Sold by Amazon"") ensures that you get a genuine product, Buying from third party Amazon market place is always questionable since these are not controlled by Amazon and that is where the counterfeit products which are cheaply made floods the market. I always have trust when products are purchased directly from Amazon.

5.0,"I have medium yellowish-olive skin tone which has been difficult to find a neutral.  This shade ""Tea and Crumpets"" is beautiful!  I was looking for a color that would match as closely as possible to my natural nail bed color, and I was not having any luck!  Finally I went less pink, more neutral/tan, and this is so flattering!  Contrary to what I thought, it's lighter than my skin tone, and it actually brightens my fingers.  I mistakenly thought lighter colors would darken my skin, but this is a *splendid* exception.  (nice word - splendid)  It's definitely a frost, and I find it streaks a little, but I'm not a professional, so that's fine for me.  I'm just thrilled to death I finally found a color that isn't goth or weird or screaming for attention.  I like subtle and refined, and this is it!  It's so pretty!",1455321600,2016-02-13
5.0,"As a point of comparison, I use Lancome Creme Mousse Confort Cleanser and Clean & Clear Advantage 3-in-1 Exfoliating Cleanser to cleanse my skin.
This product is a step up from the Clean & Clear formula and works just as well as the Lancome for me.

Puret&eacute; Thermale 3-in-1 is a cleansing milk, toner and eye-makeup remover all in one.  It's easy to use - simply massage onto the face and eye area and rinse or wipe with a cotton pad.  The product contains cleansing oils and a shea butter extract.  Like all Vichy products, it contains their mineral-rich volcanic water.  I prefer to rinse versus wipe off.

The texture is creamy and it rinses away clean, leaving skin feeling smooth and supple.  I have sensitive skin and did not encounter issues.  I would recommend this product.",1455494400,2016-02-15

5.0,"This is by far my favorite product by Vita Liberata. I have fair skin and don't tan easily. Before using this, it was either TanTowels or Jergens Natural Glow for me. The Vita Liberata truly is FABULOUS just like the tube says. I'm very sensitive to odors and this has none, unlike every other self-tanner I've tried. No streaking, dries fast, almost fool-proof when applying. I use my hands and wash them afterwards. Makes you tan gradually as well as fading gradually. Very moisturizing, too.

While this is more expensive than the others I've used, you need so little it's very cost effective.",1469836800,2016-07-30

5.0,"Love this product! I have a couple of bottles of this miscellar water that both my teen daughter and I have been using. She has clear skin, not oily, only rarely breaks out. Doesn't use any acne medicines. I have oily skin and a lifelong battle with acne. My skin is mostly clear, but that's due to coating myself in acne medicines 24/7.

My daughter uses this to clean her face and remove her eye makeup. She's thrilled with it. I use it as a toner after washing my face, and before using my acne products. It leaves my skin very smooth and refreshed.

Highly recommended!",1493942400,2017-05-05
4.0,I really like La Roche-Posay's products.  This is a very good foam cleanser that cleans with out leaving your face feeling dry. I recently bought Noble Formula Zinc bar soap and I LOVE it. It  also cleans very well with out drying I will be using both.,1388534400,2014-01-01

4.0,"I usually use a wide toothed comb because I have thick long hair.  I did want to try the Baxter Pocket Comb because it'd been described as sturdier than the usual comb.  I've used the comb on both wet and dry hair and it's held up well.

It removes tangles easily. It's sturdy, it doesn't bend the way cheaper combs do and none of the teeth are in danger of breaking off.  Though it looks like the small pocket combs that men used to carry years ago, it even works well on a thick mane of hair.",1389312000,2014-01-10
5.0,"I use a product with Retin-A nightly, and while it does a nice job smoothing out fine lines, it cause my skin to dry out and be sun sensitive. I am also dealing with outbreaks of rosacea, so I need a gentle but effective moisturizer. The Mario Badescu Moisture Magnet covers all of my requirements and is working very well.

This is a small, 2 oz bottle, but a little goes a long way. A small dot is all I need to apply to my entire face. It is thick, creamy, and has a very light scent. It feels a little greasy when it goes on, but it is quickly absorbed. Without makeup, it leaves my skin with a glowing look. And while I use makeup sparingly, it works well under makeup as a base and lasts all day.",1473984000,2016-09-16
5.0,"I believe this target is targeted mainly toward men, but I wanted to try it as it seems like I never get a close enough shave with feminine shaving products.

I used it on my legs - which seems to always have a little bit of stubble left no matter what razor or shaving cream I use. I have to say this product does what it says it will do. The shave was the closest I've ever experienced and my legs were baby smooth. I let my boyfriend try it on his face and he was just as pleased. This is a product I will purchase for both my and my man's use on a regular basis.",1437436800,2015-07-21
5.0,Good shampoo. I enjoy this brand a lot. They do not test on animals. Always nice quality product as well. I have curly hair. Gentle on it.,1444608000,2015-10-12
5.0,"Powder is the usual finishing touch after foundation to matte down the infamous 'T-zone' of forehead and nose that most of us have. Japonesque Finishing Powder is translucent, meaning that it works for probably all but the darkest complexions. (I'm a twin to Snow White, so it's rare a powder is ever too light for me.)

As for the powder itself, I'm in love! The finish truly is silky; the powder is whisper light and imparts a very, very subtle glow. That means that your T-zone oiliness is tamped down, but the skin doesn't look DEAD. It looks radiant, alive - matte and beautiful. (The compact comes with an applicator, but I'm a brush girl myself.)

Working with this powder is a sensual delight! It's so silky and fine that it feels like a beauty treatment just putting it on. The luxurious case is just an added bonus and will do your handbag proud.",1414972800,2014-11-03
5.0,"This foot cream worked so well I could not believe it at all. It was not greasy, nor chalky. Rather, it was smooth and very soothing. I was surprised that it had little discernible odor. It simply went on smooth, soothed, and was a pleasure to deal with. It helped my feet become happy feet.",1445126400,2015-10-18
4.0,"This is a great basic brown pencil. It's soft enough not to tug, but does make for a less precise line. Smudges easily, but stays well enough. For the price I'm not sure I'll repurchase, since a lot of eyeliners are more pigmented and just as creamy with a longer wear time for the same price point. But, for a decent basic this is a good one. Bonus, this shade does double duty really well as an eyebrow pencil too!",1513036800,2017-12-12
5.0,"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1471651200,2016-08-20
2.0,"Love OPI nail polish. This color did not work out for me. I was hoping for a sheer peachy pink.  I have tried applying it several times, with lots of shaking to blend.  Every time I got a streaky look unless I applied enough coats to create an opaque look, which was then a bit too white and bright to flatter my pale skin tone.",1471824000,2016-08-22
5.0,"Smells great and works awesome. Yes, it is thick, but is is a paste. Typically we rub in between our fingers and style according with only a dab, and re apply as needed. We found out that it can clump if not rubbed into the hair well enough.",1473206400,2016-09-07
2.0,"Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum is too much for my sensitive skin.  Other non-sensitive Juice products do not irritate my skin the way this does.  It is pleasant to apply, but it did leave my skin in a fussier state.  A closer peek at the ingredients revealed salicylic acid (from white willow bark), which is an ingredient that my skin tends to rebel against.",1417996800,2014-12-08

5.0,I love this product. Great eye product.,1508889600,2017-10-25
3.0,"The cream feel nice on the face. It's not oily or greasy, and it spreads easily. The pump doesn't necessarily squirt out the exact same amount each time, so sometimes there's a bit too much and sometimes not enough.

I've used this every night for five days now, and took photos of my eye before and after. As far as I can tell, it has made no difference at all to the lines around my eyes or the puffiness. Perhaps after a longer period of time I'd notice a change, in which case I'll update.

I'd recommend looking for another cream if you're targeting wrinkles.",1442275200,2015-09-15

5.0,Appears to be the real deal,1502496000,2017-08-12
4.0,A really good firming moisturizer. This keeps my skin hydrated and more pliable. This would reduce the likelihood of stretch marks but at the end of the day so would any other hydrator. This product feel good and went on nicely. It dried fast and kept my skin soft until the next shower so for that alone I recommend it. It's also free of harmful chemicals.,1503792000,2017-08-27
4.0,"The Luxury beauty box was so much fun. I have always loved samples. As a little girl I couldn't wait until the Avon Lady came to our house and had little samples of lipstick and perfume. The Luxury beauty box was great, and because of it I've bought several larger items, the credit they are now giving is a way to buy one of the items, or others that are listed, though I don't know if that will always be available. Even without it, this is a cool box of treasures.

The wow hair really worked on my dry frizzy hair. It made it shine while I applied it to my dry hair and used my fingers to style. I am a wash and wear sort of girl, don't want to bother with curling irons, hair dryers etc, so this product, applied to dry hair, worked perfectly for me, I ended up buying a full sized bottle based on this sample.

Elemis pro collagen marine cream- oh, my skin loves Elemis. It feel so good and smooth after use, and I noticed a difference. I also bought this, and Elemis eye cream, not included in the sample but I wanted to try it based on how much I liked the skin cream

L-occitane hand cream. At first the smell put me off a little at first but it grew on me. The sample size was good sized and I liked the feel on my hands. It absorbed without leaving them feeling greasy or sticky

Hyla3D by Jan Marini, a small sample but since very little is used it actually lasted a couple of days. I really like this, I did feel it plumped up my skin. I would like to buy it in the future, maybe a Christmas gift, or save up my pennies.

Vichy thermal rich cream- another winner. A very generous sample too, worked great. I would use it but I liked the Elemis more. However, this had a lovely cream feel and was so smooth going on, absorbed quickly with no greasy after feel.

Tan Towel- one was enough, blotchy weird color, would not buy

Youth eye complex, seemed okay but the sample was so small that it was hard to tell if it did anything or not, companies really don't do themselves a favor by giving such a small sample

Mario Badesco glycolic toner- Another small sample but actually used a couple of days, clipped the top closed. Most toners try me out, I had stopped using them, this was wonderful, I felt refreshed and clean but no drying. I bought a full bottle of this after using the sample

White tea fragrance was so lovely. I have a few perfumes I need to use up and I will be buying this. Light and fresh.",1504051200,2017-08-30

2.0,"I don't really like it.  The brush is divided into two parts.  The main section and the tip which is rounded or bulb-like.  The rounded tip on the end gets in my way and it didn't really carry enough mascara to do my bottom lashes.  The mascara made my lashes clump together which is the main reason why I don't like it.  So instead of 100 lashes to flutter, I had 30 stuck together.  I may give it another try, but my first impression is not good.  However sometimes a mascara is more liquid at first and then settles down and then it doesn't clump.  But I still don't like that round ball at the end.  I had to go back over my lashes with my Cover Girl mascara to try to separate the lashes which didn't work well since they were already clumped.",1468713600,2016-07-17

4.0,"Boscia Make up Break Up and Tsubaki cleansing oils have been my usual go-to's for the first step in cleaning my face each night, but this one from Skin & Co is just as good. All it takes is a couple pumps of this wonderful cleansing oil in your hands (no cotton balls or pads are necessary), rub directly onto your face and eyes until the oil turns milky, then rinse with warm water. Every trace of makeup, dirt, and grime will be gone and you are left with silky smooth skin that isn't the least bit tight or dry feeling. This cleansing oil works especially well if you have oily skin. Since oil helps breaks down other oil, this will clean your face without over-drying it, which for many cleansers is a big problem that only leads to more oil production by your skin. If you use products like Benefit's They're Real mascara or Kat Von D's eyeliner, then you will really like this cleansing oil as it does a fantastic job at breaking down waterproof/smudge-proof/sweat-proof makeup that usually requires a lot of elbow grease and heavy duty makeup remover to take off. I have terribly sensitive/allergic reactive skin (that is bane to my love of Ulta/Sephora/so many sites) that reacts badly to half of the products I try, but thankfully this cleansing oil is gentle enough that there weren't any issues. I do wish it didn't have the extra colorants, though.

The only downside to this cleansing oil is the cost. Though the directions say to use three or four pumps, you can easily get away with only two which will help this last a little bit longer. This is one of those ""investment"" products that some will find worth it because it is so gentle yet so effective that it allows you to skip another step in your skincare routine - second face washing, heavy/second application of face cream due to tight skin after washing - and therefore (hopefully) eliminates the need for buying and using another product.",1467849600,2016-07-07
5.0,"This is everything I want for my skin. There is no fragrance and it goes on smoothly. For dry eczema prone skin, this is a moisturizer, protectant and barrier. It helps my skin stay hydrated and prevent cracking. It spreads easily on wet or dry skin (many balms don't) and is just a pleasure to use. Probably my favorite Mustela product.",1493078400,2017-04-25
5.0,"I was a little concerned about using this due to my sensitive skin.  I shouldn't have worried.  I've been using this for weeks now and my skin has never looked better.

Even the higher setting is gentle enough on my skin, but the difference in my skin condition is palpable!

When you first get this out of the box, you'll need to charge it before using it.  It rests on its charger easily and gives you a green light when its ready to go.

I found it easy to select the strength I wanted to use and very easy to use.

Best of all, it feels really good on my skin.  At first I worried that it might be too gentle - it doesn't feel like it's doing much.  But the difference is noticeable right away.  My skin is cleaner and the Mia FIT buffs away those horrid dry bits of winter skin.

I'm now a fan and have added this to my regular routine.  Note that it also comes with a small tube of the Skin Illuminating Cleanser and it's wonderful.  It helps make my skin look so clear and soft!  (Quick note - you can use any cleanser with it!)",1482105600,2016-12-19
4.0,"I bought this product to add shine to my damaged hair. If you have used silk infusion before by CHI the horrendous smell will be familiar. I do like that the product is also a TP for flat ironing purposes but you must use this VERY lightly or your hair will be an oil slick. I have very thick hair so for me to say this you know it is oily! I do get great shine when using this product BUT I do not like that you can only use this before flat ironing or blow drying. It isn't the type of spray you can utilize just to get shine, it is just too greasy. I was hoping for both options. In any case if you want say ""shine on the go"" you will need something like bumble and bumble or another type of shine mist that is lighter. I do enjoy the results but not as versatile as I would like! ps. CHI please please get a different fragrance for your product line everything smells like old man cologne...bleh",1280275200,2010-07-28

4.0,"This curling iron works well to add some volume and soft waves to my hair. It has an on and off switch with a light to indicate when it's heating. The cord is long enough so that I have plenty of room to move around. The cord will rotate around the bottom of the wand as it is rotated, so that it doesn't get tangled. The barrel is a good size to add waves to my medium length hair. It comes with a glove to protect your hand from the hot barrel. You just grab a section of hair and hold it in place while it curls. The barrel can then be slid out and the curl sets. I use some hairspray to help it hold, but for the most part the waves will stay in for a few hours. I grew up using the old fashioned curling irons that had a section to pinch the hair against the barrel while you rolled it up. Using just a wand and a glove has been an adjustment, one that I haven't yet mastered, but when I do it right, the results to my hair look very nice.",1525910400,2018-05-10

3.0,"Foams up nicely, but the slippery-ness and odd fragrance does not appeal to me.  I think the slippery feel is from the amount of glycerin (second in the ingredient list).  The fragrance reminds me of something I tried a few decades ago--It is ""tangy"", but not quite floral and not quite citrus.  Every time I use it, my brain focuses on trying to identify the fragrance.

With the slippery feel and the weird fragrance, the product does not give me a pleasant, uplifting experience.  I don't hate it--I don't love it.  It may suds nice, but I don't feel any great benefit from it.  It has not helped, nor hurt, my facial skin.",1448236800,2015-11-23

I got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small Shakespeare troupe in our county). It works amazingly!

This full-coverage foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It comes with a paddle for mixing colors, but use it with a gentle touch, as just a simple swipe of the finger across the surface of the creme produced complete, opaque coverage on my hand (see image attached - the darkest color by the thumb). It gives a nice satiney finish that is easy to layer with other makeup like blush and highlighter. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. It removes well with just soap and water. Truly excellent product.",1497830400,2017-06-19

5.0,"My husband is a big fan of the bottle, and we both love the scent. Rather fresh in nature, and definitely fits the Jimmy Choo style. It works great as an everyday scent.",1522800000,2018-04-04
5.0,"I like products that multitask, as I like a no-fuss morning routine.  Having SPF included in my daily moisturizer is perfect, because I rarely remember to apply SPF for normal work days.  This moisturizer is not too heavy, absorbs quickly and smells pleasant.",1473206400,2016-09-07
5.0,"Oh yeah! I have been looking for a good cleanser/makeup remover for a LONG time and I have tried out a LOT of them from different brands and most of them either leave my face/eyes greasy or irritate my skin causing breakouts...I bought this H20 solution after seeing a video review on youtube. I do not regret it whatsoever. Have been using it for two days and LOVE it. I picked the one for oily skin which I suffer from and boy, this cleanser cleans my face so well yet no ounce of grease. It also does not dry off my skin but leaves it well balanced and feeling FRESH! Yes, it's pricey BUT for the amount and quality you can't find anything better especially in the drugstores. I am familiar with Bioderma brand when I used to live in Europe and it's a very well respected and much used brand. It's made in France so quality is guaranteed. In other words, this is one of the best skin care products I have purchased for a longest time and I plan on sticking to it.
You can use this solution to remove your make up then wash your face with the cleanser or if you are not wearing much makeup, wash it first then apply the solution - either way it leaves the skin very well moisturized and feeling clean and soft",1390176000,2014-01-20
4.0,"So, I really like this bronzer. It is packaged really nicely, with the brush fitting into the bottom compartment. The bronzer applies nicely and blends very well. I just wish I got a darker color. This one is exactly the same color as my skin, making it a better finishing powder. It is matte, with no shine, which I like. I'm over all the shine. This is an excellent product that I will try in a darker shade, while I use this over my concealer.",1437004800,2015-07-16
5.0,"DermaBlend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation covers up red spots and other imperfections on your face.  Apply to discolored areas, by using your fingertips or brush.  I prefer my fingertips.  Lightly tap the product over discolored areas, and blend gently.  The redness goes away.  The next step is to apply a setting powder. Just apply a small dusting of loose powder, using a large brush.

This quality foundation is a lifesaver for those of us with small blotches on our skin. It's excellent for me. I am a 53 year old woman and I am starting to see age spots.

This is a good product. Just find your shade.  Use it sparingly and this one fluid ounce bottle will last you several months.  It also has SPF to help protest your skin against damage from the sun and sunburn.  Use the smooth camo to dab over discolored areas, and you will be pleased.",1497571200,2017-06-16
5.0,Nice color palete. No irritation. Love it!,1443744000,2015-10-02
5.0,"I was excited to try this because I have long been familiar with the bliss brand, but hadn't tried any of their makeup products yet.  Their makeup line interested me because they described it as 'tinted skincare' and who doesn't want makeup that also has complexion boosting-benefits.  I was supposed to receive 'Coco-cabana' their darker bronzer, but actually received 'Kiss Me Caramel.'

Looking at the color in the pan it struck me as being pretty accurately named.  It's a warm-toned, caramel-colored bronzer with a ever so subtle shimmer.  I used it to contour my face along with Shimmer from the Smashbox Crush on Blush palette for my highlight.  I gently swept it just under my cheek bones, along the underside of my jawline, along my hairline, and the bridges of my nose.  When used with the Shimmer it makes for a contouring look that's perfect for a day look and adds more definition for my look.  For a night look I use it after the COVER FX Contour Kit in N Medium.  For my neutral toned light/medium skin I think this shade is perfect.  However, I do have friends whose skin trends more cool and who struggle to find a bronzer that works for their skintone and for them, I'm not sure this would work.

I also liked the longevity.  It stayed all day and I only needed to touch up after work for the night out.

As for the promised skin benefits, I'm not sure I've seen them.  Which honestly isn't surprising since I use bronzer more for contouring and am only applying a small amount to small sections of my face.  That aside I'm still very happy with this bronzer.  I think it's a great choice for contouring for someone who many not want to invest in a whole kit, especially if you already have a highlighter that you like.",1468281600,2016-07-12
5.0,"Jack Black Double Header Shampoo Plus Conditioner.  I love this shampoo/conditioner, as it feels as though it really made my hair clean, and it was easy to comb after I finished washing.  I also loved the smell.  It is sort of hard to explain, but it kind of reminded me of an ""old timey"" smell.  But the smell is not strong - just enough to sort of remind me of that wonderful old-timey smell.

I love old-timey smells (even though this is not that strong of a smell, just enough to know it's there).  That's one reason why I love going inside one of our natural stores; it has the smells and the feelings of ""old-timey"".

Because of the smell, the wonderful cleansing, and the manageability, I highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner.",1436918400,2015-07-15

5.0,"I think L'OCCITANE is the best when it comes to their rich moisturizers. They have such a huge variety in all kinds of scents and skincare needs. This moisturizer is rich in scent and texture and I know that you'll love it. It goes on smooth on your skin with its creamy, silky textur. In my opinion it would be a great addition to anyone's beauty regime and is great for all skin types. Your skin will thank you. It will not only be soft but also hydrated and we need that in the winter.",1418428800,2014-12-13

5.0,I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.,1467331200,2016-07-01
4.0,"This pomade is very light - won't make your hair feel stiff - with a great texture and aroma.  You almost can't tell you are using product in your hair.  It is a good choice if you want a soft style for your hair, not so great if you want a very firm and textured look.",1377216000,2013-08-23
4.0,"OK, I have very dry skin. I am always looking for products to help with this problem and have tried a lot of products from brands like Jack Black and Kiehl's. The common complaint is that they can leave your skin moisturized but greasy. When I saw the description as ""Oil Free"" I decided to take a chance. I did a little experiment - I put the Baxter product on one side of my face and my regular product on the other and went about my day. To my surprise, the Baxter side felt less ""tight"" and dry than the other side - the one with a product that has been working OK for me for a while. Also, it did this without leaving a greasy or oily residue. Like I said, a surprise.

Here is a twist, I was rushing out of the house and decided to use a dab of the Baxter product on my hands. A little went a long way and left my hands smooth, moisturized and not greasy. Probably not the designed use (especially when you consider the cost) but it worked very well on my hands. I guess skin is skin!

This little 4oz tube is pretty expensive but high quality ""boutique"" products do command a premium.

Recommended for anyone with dry skin.",1391040000,2014-01-30
4.0,good product,1454198400,2016-01-31
5.0,I've been using this product for many years (14) +. I credit it for keeping my neck and chest as smooth as possible. No crepey skin here and very few lines. The price through Amazon was far less than through my dermatologist. It is the real thing.,1434672000,2015-06-19
4.0,"I typically dislike all sunscreen products. They smell terrible, most make my face break out, they feel greasy and because I work outside with horses almost every single day the layer of sticky sunscreen can draw extra dust & dirt to my face and neck. This La Roche Posay Anthelios is a little different than the usual stuff out there. It has that gross sunscreen smell - BUT it goes away very quickly after you apply this. I am pretty impressed with how fast the smell is gone. We're talking minutes. Well done.

The product itself looks and feels just like most of the other sunscreens out there on the market when you pump it into your hand. It's white and is a creamy type texture. Maybe a little silkier than the cheaper grocery store beach style stuff. This goes on like a moisturizer and a little bit (for me at least) goes a long way. I find that a ball about the size of four peas is just right to cover my face completely without leaving a greasy coating on my skin. It absorbs within a few minutes and my face and neck feel soft and smooth. My face can be a nightmare with any products, but I have not had a rash or irritation from this serum. Again - well done La Roche.

My one star deduction is quite simply the value factor. As much as I like this product, I can't understand how a woman like me can afford to use it daily. The suggested use on the bottle is reapplication every two hours while exposed to the sun and daily use otherwise. If you are a active outside every day for more than two hours at this price, there is no way I can afford two or three bottles of this a month! That's more than my cell phone bill. It's a great item, but a treat, like a trip to the spa.",1445299200,2015-10-20

3.0,"I used this tonight with a loofa in the bath tonight and while it smells great, it doesn't really leave much of a shimmer like I had hoped it would.  I don't know if I thought I would look like I was painted with diamond cream (Arrested Development) but I hardly looked like an Emmy statuette.  It does make your skin nice and soft but so do other less expensive products.  Heck, buy some of that sparkly spray that sell at Halloween for your hair in bulk and add it to your body lotion.  Problem solved.",1442793600,2015-09-21
3.0,"I love makeup. I wear it every day, and am always trying new products. I even subscribe to a number of monthly ""beauty boxes.""  Was eager to try this foundation!

To use, you simply give the (tiny! mirrorless!) compact a twist and it ""shaves"" some foundation off for you. One side gives you the color, the other side gives you white. You then swirl them together, and apply.

I have pretty fair skin, and found that this was a tad too light for my complexion. I recommend this shade (01) only to those who are the lightest of the light.  It went on easily, but looked the same as any other mineral powder, in that it *accentuated* every pore and fine line on my face. I then tried it on my teenage daughter, who has perfectly smooth skin and it looked a lot better. This is basically what I've found with other mineral foundations--they work the best the better your skin is to begin with.

Now on to the brush--it is very small, with short, densely packed (not fluffy) bristles.  They are super-soft, so I have no idea how they are supposed to ""micro-exfoliate"" your skin. Doesn't make a bit of sense. It applies the foundation really well.  You can also use it with liquid foundation.

As a bonus, you get a tiny tablet that is supposed to be a facial mask, with bizarre instructions on how to use. Couldn't figure out what to do with it, nor do I even know what is in it.

Overall, I don't recommend this foundation in particular.  There are so many similar products on the market, that I don't see the need to spend nearly $80 on this one.",1430265600,2015-04-29
5.0,Perfect for the summer.  Looks like its very shimmery in the bottle but its actually very subtle when it's on and makes it look brighter in the sun.,1379894400,2013-09-23
3.0,"The product claims you will see a noticeable difference in lines after 7 days. I think that is a bit unrealistic, I have been using this for over two weeks and I don't see any huge difference, I am 50 so I do have a few wrinkles to put to the test. I think it is a good moisturizer but the claims of wrinkles being much less noticeable are overstated from my experience with this cream. The product does have a pretty strong floral fragrance, but surprisingly I actually liked it and I usually hate fragrances and it didn't linger very long. The product is a good moisturizer and I did like it, I just wouldn't pay anything near this price for just an average face cream.",1417046400,2014-11-27

And we all have an area we wish were a bit different, or one we like and want to play up.

5.0,"This MEG 21 ""bright and firm"" eye treatment is an off white creamy product in a pump dispenser to apply under the eyes and surrounding areas. I'm using it twice a day after washing my face per the directions. A little goes a long way- one full pump is too much even for the areas around both eyes, so I gently depress the pump and use about a half of a pump twice a day. This treatment isn't greasy at all, though my skin feels a bit tacky after I first apply it. After a few minutes, it gets fully absorbed and I can apply my eye makeup. This eye treatment feels nice, it moisturizes well and has a firming feel, leaves my skin smooth feeling and doesn't irritate my eyes or skin. It does have a mild fragrance that's pleasant, doesn't affect my sensitive skin or allergies and dissipates quickly.

MEG 21 claims to help fine lines, crow's feet, puffiness and discoloration. My biggest issues are dark circles and fine lines from aging. MEG 21 has botanicals-such as Vitamin K rich Suma Root- that I've read may actually help dark circles. It also has ingredients that are supposed to inhibit glycation on the skin from sugar that causes wrinkles due to a negative effect on collagen and elastin. This treatment has a lot of potential, though it will take about 2-4 weeks of daily use to see benefits (according to MEG 21 customer service), and I'll need to use it longer and update my review. For now, as compared to other eye treatments, I'm really pleased with how this treatment  moisturizes and makes my skin feel smooth and firm around my eyes, plus it causes no skin or eye irritation. While I can't judge the long term benefit yet, MEG 21 eye treatment seems like an excellent product. I'm rating it 5 stars and will update as appropriate.

12/23/2016 Update: I've been using this eye treatment regularly for a few months. Nothing will ever rid me entirely of dark circles I've had since being a teen, but Meg 21 works as well or slightly better than other dark circle treatments I've tried over the years such as Hylexin. My best friend for dark circles is Amazing Cosmetics Concealer. Also, my fine lines around my eyes are barely visible, and my skin looks and feels firm. Crow's feet and puffiness weren't issues before I started and still aren't issues for me, so I can't comment on the effectiveness of Meg 21 there. Notably, I still haven't run out of this product despite making it my regular eye treatment the last few months. Nothing works equally well for everyone, but I would definitely purchase this Meg 21 treatment in the future.",1473724800,2016-09-13
4.0,"Japonesque Velvet Touch Blush Shade 3 is peachy pink with a little bit of shimmer. The color builds as you apply more layers. Too much pigment can make the older generation look like clown make-up was used. With Japonesque Blush, one or two 'layers' is enough & doesn't look clownish. Younger women can apply it heavier & still look great. It stayed on all day for me (about 6 hours).

The mirrored compact measures 2 1/4"" square. The compact is a little bit hard for me to open...which can be a good thing, because the blush won't get over everything in my purse or make-up bag. But, I always end up getting my finger or thumb in the blush when I open the compact. I'm practicing other 'opening techniques' to prevent this problem.

I was actually surprised it had fragrance as I usually associate ""sensitive skin"" products to be free or near free of scents perfumes.

2.0,"The masque itself is fine and left my skin feeling good, reduced blotchiness, pores a little tighter. For me it is no better in terms of efficacy than many other masques I have tried. It works well enough and the residue rinsed off fairly easily.

I am going 2 stars for this product as the application instructions just did not work for me. The masque itself was very large for my face, landing a fair amount in my hair. The white section peeled off easily for both halves of the masque. Unfortunately the clear section would not come off without removing the masque ingredients. I work with bandages, dressings and peelables all day long as a nurse so I saw it as a professional challenge. I could not get this layer off, leaving the masque behind. I ended up leaving the chest plastic on. I looked like a hockey goalie but it was the only way to test it.

This felt good on and came off easily. However it is my opinion that this method of application just didn't work. I'd rather have a jar of product and apply it myself.",1470873600,2016-08-11
5.0,"There's a well known spa close to me that I love for its mud baths. But it's pricey, and I only get a chance to go once every few years. I love what the mud does for my skin, making it soft and luxurious feeling. So the experience of even a simple mud mask is relaxing to me, and that's why I ordered this product--for the spa-like feel, and for the skin care.

I love that this mud comes in a pre-cut mask that  I can easily apply to my own face. I wasn't sure how that was going to work out in terms of surface coverage, but it really is awesome.

The mud comes preloaded on something akin to cheesecloth. It is precut for the upper and lower face. Applying it is really easy, and I was able to get full coverage over my entire face.

I could feel a slight tingle as soon as the mask touched my face. And that slight tingle continued the entire time I had the mask on. It wasn't painful or irritating. On the contrary, I drew myself a hot bath, put my head back and feet up, and let the mask do its work for a good 30 minutes (the directions indicate a minimum of 10 minutes, but it just felt so relaxing!

I'm not able to describe scent from the mud on the mask except to say that it reminds me of the spa--clean plus something else that I rather enjoy.

Removing the mask was simple. And, as it doesn't dry out completely, it was painless. It was also virtually mess free.

And best of all, I really can see improvement in minimizing my poors. My face also feels softer and smoother than before I applied the mask.

Unfortunately, the price point is beyond what I can typically afford (or at least what I'm willing to pay) on a regular basis. But I consider these a treat that id be willing to give myself from time to time.",1471132800,2016-08-14

The tube is a very generous size (4oz) especially compared to women's night cream at the same cost. The lid could use a little re-design.

The cream has no fragrance and is non-greasy. I suggest you use a small glob to start with and massage it in until it liquefies and  absorbs. If you use too much it will sit on top of your skin like a coat of wax.

I'm not sure how much AHA (glycolic acid) there is in the cream. It doesn't tingle or itch like Roc or Neutrogena AHA cream.

What she was smelling was merely a few scent molecules that had wafted off the paper and ""stuck"" to my clothes.

The gel is very cooling and soothing when applied to the skin, especially when kept in the refrigerator and applied after a warm shower.  It is not at all greasy and leaves the skin feeling smooth.

The ingredients list Vichy mineral water as well as glycerin, dimethicone, and other ingredients that lock in moisture.  Regular use will reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

5.0,"I do find this to be very calming and refreshing.  It does contain trace elements and selenium, and it is pH balanced.  The bottle is metal with a nozzle type sprayer that has worked fine for me.  The trace elements are antioxidants that help protect the skin from damage and signs of aging and can reduce inflammation.
It couldn't be easier to use, just spray the face - it is very gentle, and wait a few minutes and you can pat it dry.
It reminds me a bit of rose water spray, which I usually use because I like the rose scent, and it just works well for me, but this is unscented, works well, is natural, and it seems like a better formulation for calming skin and using after office (or sometimes, at-home) procedures like chemical peels.

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19
4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

4.0,"This item was given to me for my review.
Long, long ago, I tried using a tanning lotion on my legs. The lotion gave me an orange/yellow look, with streaks, and the result was that I looked like my liver was failing. Not a good look on me. My hands were stained, as well, even though I washed them afterwards. So, I was not super hopeful about this Hampton Sun Sunless Tanning Mist. I mean, there is a reason people make jokes about these products. However, I found that this tanning mist is easy to use and gives me a good result. I exfoliated my skin, dried myself off, and sprayed the mist on in the shower, making sure to do one leg at a time then rub it in, so it was put on smoothly. The first time I used it, I only did my legs. The mist does have a smell, but it was not too bad and dissipated after it dried. The mist went on easily, even when the can was help upside down, and it went on evenly, so I did not have streaks or darker areas where my skin is rougher. I am considered fair skinned, but I get dark easily. The lotion turned a nice, light, barely there, but still noticeably there, bronze. The next time I used it, I used it on my upper body and my legs. I had no problems with the mist, and I did not have any rashes with it, even though my skin is a bit sensitive. The color was lighter, probably because I put it on lighter and only went with one thin layer. I did not turn orange or a sickly yellow. It is nice. My only complaint is that the directions are terribly hard to read on the metallic background, especially because the lettering is in a light colored, small font. Additionally, one of the directions seems to say that I need to ""watch out around the hairline,"" but it does not detail what that means. Watch out how? Again, the manufacturer seems to believe that the user has experience with the product, or with the type of product. My experience is limited. I did make sure to blend the spray well, and that seemed to be okay. I am not sure what else I should do or may need to do when I apply more?",1434931200,2015-06-22
5.0,"I LOVE this stuff!  Thanks to a reviewer, I watched the U Tube video before I used the product.  The first time I used it, I twisted my hair and pinned it up and let it air dry, I have to say it came out really adorable.  Light, non frizzy curls.  The second time I used it, I dried my bangs and applied about a dimes worth to both sides of my hair, scrunched it and let it air dry.  Again, super nice waves, although I liked the curl better when I twisted it.  In the U tube video's it shows the models curling their hair with a curling iron.  This is not needed unless you have really straight and fine hair.  I have used many products, such as this, and all of them made my hair feel 'crunchy' to the touch.  The curls/waves you get with the texture lotion are very, very soft.  A few people mentioned the price but I think it's reasonable as I only wash my hair twice a week and used such a small amount of it.  The smell is wonderful and both times I used it my waves stayed nice, soft and non frizzy for 2 straight days. I really love it and will definitely continue to use it.",1491868800,2017-04-11

This would not be a moisturizer for most people, but is perfect for me, since I really don't need a moisturizer and have bought serums in the past.  I am at the age where I need a little more heft to my skin products and this seems like a perfect consistency.

I can't say this doesn't have any residue whatsoever, but it is so minimal that I will absolutely use it again. I am a 'no pooer' (google it) so I was worried that it would leave flakeyness or build up, but it rinsed right out. Sometimes a girl just wants to put product in her hair even if she's not supposed to! As an added bonus, this brand has way less nasties and poisons than most others out there.",1374192000,2013-07-19

My legs did have color, but with my skin tone it was more of a orange tan.. Not horrible but not a desired look..

I gave to my sister in law to try and she LOVED it ! She has a dark skin tone though and as a brunette and a base tan from the summer still the color looked really good..

5.0,"I have ordered my second jar of the Revision Firming Night Treatment, which means I still love the results I'm getting.  I apply this product at night as my moisturizer and by morning, my skin still has a dewy appearance (not greasy, but moisturized,(thus the 'glow' description in title).  Due to thyroid issues, my skin tends to be dry.  I have tried some of the more expensive moisturizers that, by morning, leave my skin looking and feeling pretty dry.  I like the Revision Night Treatment so much that I would use it even in the day time; however, I think it might be a little too moisturizing to use under foundation.

The jar contains 1 oz., where other more expensive moisturizers usually contain 1.7 oz., but I believe the RFNT is still more economical as it seems to last about the same length of time.  Very little product is needed for each application.

Regarding what it actually does for my skin, I can't be sure that it is actually getting rid of wrinkles.  It might be softening the appearance just because of how it moisturizes.

All in all, I believe it is a great product for the money and I certainly recommend it.",1391385600,2014-02-03

This product by Bliss is pretty good and because the shades are not really describable in words, I'd suggest finding the most suitable for your skin tone in a store before ordering online. The Natural shade is  just as I've discovered most Bliss cosmetics, rather yellow in undertone, which I learned years ago is the most common for a majority of Caucasian skin tones. This particular formula is non-irritating and not offensive with added scents. Like the other Bliss Cosmetics, this has a plastic case that is what I would call no frills so you are not paying for a high-class cosmetic product.

The color is gorgeous and looks great in the bottle. It just did not go on great due to the majority of the bottle being glitter (including ""bar"" glitter).

*layer 1 - Some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. It looked awful so I decided to go for another layer.
*layer 2- Now Twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. It looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. The glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter ""bars"" in this polish.
*layer 3- A few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail I gave up on layer 3. It was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.

The night that I painted my nails I was wishing that I hadn't. I was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. My nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating.

3.0,"I have wavy and fairly thick hair, and this never clicked completely with my mane. It's fairly waxy, and when I put it in, my hair never lay completely right or smoothly. I'd often end up with locks and clumps sticking out at odd angles, like I had slept in it. It's a disaster if my hair gets a little long, and is best with shorter hair. At least, like other Baxter products, it does have hold without getting brittle and crunchy, but I also disliked the waxy, slightly greasy feel it gave my hair. It might work well for other types of hair, but not for mine.

4.0,"This is an interesting device for treating periorbital wrinkles or crown's feet around the eyes. It is easy to use and the treatment only takes 2 minutes a day.

The device is small and lightweight. It has a treatment tip that emits invisible laser radiation, an on/off button, and a multi-color light to indicate the device status. It has a non-replaceable Li-Ion battery and that can be fully charged within 2 hours. Charging is done via a standard mini-USB cable and a 5VDC 1A power adapter (both included). There are no user-replaceable parts as the device is designed to last for 3 years or more. It comes with a 1-year warranty.

The device is designed to use around the eyes where you can feel bone beneath the skin. That is, specifically, the area around the outer corner of the eye and below the eye. Never use it on the eye, eyelids or point the laser directly at the eye. You should read the manual in its entirety before using the device for the first time. The is a long list of warnings and precautions that you should know about.

The treatment procedure is simple and easy. Turn the device (the light will lit green),  place the laser treatment tip flat against the skin and glide it slowly in small circular motions, performing multiple passes throughout the treatment to cover the entire area. The device will lit up purple and vibrates when the laser is firing during treatment, so you will get a feedback that it is working. After 1 minute, it will turn itself off. Then repeat the procedure on the other eye. For post treatment care, the manufacturer recommends their Nourishing Eye Renewal Cream. I use my current eye cream and it seems to work just as good.

The laser may cause a stinging and uncomfortable sensation in the skin, as well as redness or swelling in some instances. I tried it on my forearm for the first time as suggested in the manual. It did sting a lot. It felt like a mild burn. It was uncomfortable enough to make me not want to continue. For the sake of a proper review, I continued the 2-minute treatment. My treated skin felt very tender and was a little red. I applied an eye cream to help soothe the skin. Next morning, the redness was gone and I felt better.

The manual recommends a daily treatment plan for 8 straight weeks (do not use it for more than 8 weeks). I'm 2 weeks into the treatment plan now and I can see a difference in the wrinkles. They are noticeably softer and less defined. It does appear that the treatment would actually work. The manual says the best results occur few weeks after the 8-week course. I'll have to revisit this after 8 weeks, but for now, so far so good.",1442534400,2015-09-18

3.0,"The Obagi products I have tried thus far have been very good. I expected to feel the same about this product, but instead I have mixed feelings. I have gone through probably 10 tubes of La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo, which is a 5.5% benzoyl peroxide cream. I LOVE it, but figured this Clenziderm Lotion would perform similarly because it has 5% benzoyl peroxide. I have also used PanOxyl 10% Foaming Wash, as well as several other OTC benzoyl peroxide products (usually around 2.5%).

Although it is effective at obliterating acne and keeping it at bay, this Clenziderm lotion feels very harsh to me. It has a sting after application that stays around for a good 15-20 minutes before going away. It also makes my skin red wherever I apply it (and it stays red for a while too). Now, as mentioned above, I am no stranger to benzoyl peroxides of this strength. I have also used many AHA/glycolics on my skin and have tolerated them very well. I am not someone with particularly sensitive or reactive skin. I have even used Panoxyl 10 as a face mask in the past, which was slightly irritating but it went away as soon as I washed it off (I don't know if it is ""recommended"" in the usage directions, so take that idea with a grain of salt ;)).

Although I like Obagi Clenziderm Lotion enough to finish it, I don't believe I would purchase another tube because of the irritation--and more so because it doesn't dethrone La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo. I have been using Clenziderm solely as a spot treatment, and I like it for that purpose.",1492214400,2017-04-15

The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because in the description it says that one pad should clean ten nails. I have not found this to be true. I don't know if that is because I always use 2 coats or because I like to have my nails completely clean and maybe they are big(?), I don't know.

The photo of the box at Amazon is not terribly useful, just google search and go to their website and check out the more detailed chart tool on triabeauty.com . Once you determine it's going to work for you, you should follow the instructions carefully and follow the schedule. My wife is Indian, with brown skin and dark brown-black hair, and it worked properly. At high settings, we would not call it painful, but depends on your tolerance level and the area you are using it at. You can always choose a lower setting and do the treatment a while longer. The hair does diminish and results are begun to be seen even in as little as 4 weeks. Quite handy to have, less expensive than going to laser treatment at dermatologists, more long lasting results than waxing or shaving.

I found myself really struggling to collect up strawberry seeds for the areas that needed exfoliating, mostly my chin and nose.
The results are lackluster at best, but the cream really does make your skin feel soft and moisturized even if it doesn't feel exfoliated.

3.0,"I have a really hard time finding a red that doesn't look orange-y with my uber pale skin due to its pink undertones. When I do find a red with a blue tint, it's usually on the darker side. Finding a red that comes across as a true red - no orange, no blue, just red regardless of the skin tone its worn on - is rather difficult to do. This lip creme from Oribe is one of those rare true reds. When applied, this color is the classic red lipstick that needs nothing more than a simple cat eye makeup to look perfect. It applies very smoothly and easily, doesn't have a prominent scent, and doesn't have a funky taste. The color in the photographs for this listing are not representative at all of the color when it was applied to my lips. It looks like the color was photoshopped on to the lips of the models for the different skin tones for each of the three colors Oribe offers

While the color is gorgeous, this isn't a lipstick I would really recommend, especially for this price. if you don't use a lip primer and lip liner, this lipstick will migrate and feather and come off on everything - anyone you kiss, your cup, your eating utensils, your teeth. If not applied to something to adhere it to lips and then set properly, it was shocking how fast it came off. If you have any trace of dryness on your lips, this color will exacerbate it. If you apply it with too much pressure, the bullet is so soft and creamy it is like smooshing frosting between your fingers. If you can, use a lip brush to apply this over prepped lips. The creaminess helps to keep your lips from getting dried out, and you can remove this lipstick with just a swipe of a tissue.

Even though this lipstick is a such lovely color and perfect shade of red, I can't really recommend this for more than a special evening out or for photos. For anywhere from $5.00 to $30.00 less you can get lipsticks from Dior, Marc Jacobs, Urban Decay, BITE, Tarte, Besame, or others are as creamy and pigmented as this from Oribe but last all day. Even $6.00 lipsticks from Nyx (the Butter Lipstick or Gloss) gives pigment as good and stays longer than this one from Oribe. Finding this perfect red in lip friendly formula is great, but with the prep work needed to make it last for longer than a cup of coffee is a lot for a lippie that costs this much doesn't justify the cost with the options out there.",1491696000,2017-04-09

4.0,"I never get pedicures -- I just use a pumice stone at home -- and my feet have been getting a bit rough, so I was excited to try this out.  It works really well to smooth out rough areas and calluses!

This comes with two rollers:  a blue, coarser one for tougher calluses and a purple, finer-grained one for calluses that aren't as bad.  Since I have sensitive skin, I've only used the purple one -- but it works great to smooth out rough areas!  After using this twice this past week, my feet are softer than they've been since maybe I was ten.  :-)

I'd definitely recommend using this over your bathtub or in your shower.  I have a small shower stool, and sit there to do my feet since it gives off a lot of dead skin flakes.  (Using a towel under your feet would work too, of course, but you definitely want something to make clean-up easy.)

The best things about this are:

*  comes with the two rollers, so you can be as gentle or as tough as you'd like on your feet

*  the rollers are really easy to change out -- you simply depress a button and they pop off.

The reason I gave this four stars instead of five are:

*  there is no speed or pressure control; it would have been nice if you could use this on a gentler speed; I know that it probably needs to move at a minimum speed in order to work, but it does hurt a wee bit when using it

*  it would be nice if the rollers were easier to clean; the package comes with a little brush, but it doesn't remove all the debris off the rollers

Overall, I really like this!  It's the perfect device to use as we get head into sandal weather!",1430784000,2015-05-05

5.0,"I usually use Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisture Repair Cream because 1) it works and 2) my skin is highly reactive and does not do well with any ingredients found in skin creams.  But I was offered L'Occitane Almond Milk Concentrate to try out, and I love it.  It has a gentle scent which, happily has not caused me to break out in a hideous rash, and which I find quite pleasant.  It seems to moisturize as effectively as my Aveeno repair cream, so I can't say if one is more effective than the other.

The real difference, of course, is the cost.  The L'Occitane Almond Milk Concentrate goes for $49 for 7 ounces.  My Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisture Repair Cream costs about $9 for an 11 oz. tub.

I compared the ingredients of each.  The L'Occitane Almond Milk Concentrate has the standard indecipherable ingredients plus Almond Oil and Milk.  The Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisture Repair Cream has the standard indecipherable ingredients, along with a number of oat products.

So why am I tempted to buy the L'Occitane Almond Milk Concentrate again?  It makes me feel pampered.  It smells divine.  The jar is a heavy glass in an elegant design.  And while it might make me feel poorer, it makes me feel special .

2.0,"Wow... what is this, cosmetics wars? You have the 5 star reviews supposedly by the people who work for the product line, and then a load of 1 star reviews by people, who have a different problem - one of whom gives every product by this company 1 star, but still purchases the items the company offers, only to keep giving it 1 star. Now if I get something from a company that gets only 1 star, I probably won't be getting more of their products.
It just seems a little odd and a little hard to believe either of the 'camps' reviews. I also noticed that Vine reviewers, who are totally impartial, give their honest opinions and are 'voted down' because they are giving it 3 - 5 stars (not just 1 star) - in other words giving *honest reviews* and which are obviously not making some people happy.  Seriously??

Moving on: I got this product to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I love eye shadow palettes and was excited to try something new.  This palette is okay but definitely not worth the price.  It came with a travel compact as well (a small compact to put your choice of eye shadows, blush, lipstick in).

The Good:
- The eye shadows did appear to be packed well, I didn't have much trouble with fallout.
- The blush had decent staying power
- The lipstick went on nicely
- The case is very solid and includes a tool to swap the different trays between the large palette and the travel compact.

The Neutral:
- This is a mostly neutral eye shadow palette there are some greys and some mauves.  Two of the eye shadows have a very nice gold shimmer to them.
- Most of the eye shadows are glittery.  There are only a few matte shadows in here.  So if you are a big matte eye shadow fan this isn't the palette for you.

The Bad:
- The eye shadows do not have much pigmentation.  Not nearly as good as Urban Decay or even The Balm eye shadow palettes I have.
- The eye shadow brush included is better than the foam applicator included in most drugstore eye shadows but still not all that useful.  I used it once and then never used it again.
- The eye shadow trays are different sizes which is just weird, so you can only grab certain ones for your travel compact.
-  The blush isn't very pigmented (I love my Tarte Amazonian Clay blush much better).
- The two orange/brown colors in the blush were just off and looked really strange on (I have olive colored white skin)
- There really isn't a good way included to apply the lipstick so I applied with  my fingers
- The lipstick didn't have any staying power and it's not very portable so it isn't easy to reapply.  It also was very drying to my lips.
- The palette and travel compact are very heavy.
- The tool to change out the palette was hard to use and I kept dropping the trays on top of other trays (and denting the other eye shadows) when I tried to change them.
- The palette has only shallow grooves for the transfer tool and the included eye shadow brush, so they kept falling out whenever I picked up the palette to use it...it was sooo irritating.
- The travel compact has absolutely no place for a small eye shadow brush, this is really weird and makes it pretty much useless for throwing into your purse.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this palette.  I would recommend sticking to the better pigmented Urban Decay eye shadows.  If you do want a great eye shadow/blush palette The Balm's Balm Voyage palette is absolutely awesome and nearly half the cost of this one.",1418601600,2014-12-15

Second, the color is too dark to be helpful in telling whether it removed traces of makeup as it's darker than my makeup, and this was a suggested use. Why they added color to make it this dark I can't understand. I just have to hope my Mario Badescu cleanser did a thorough job and left no makeup or anything else behind. It does feel nice on my skin, but since it wasn't what I wanted or expected, I won't buy again.",1482969600,2016-12-29
5.0,"I adore this body cream!  It is one of the first I've used that reliably prevents hangnails.  It's thick and definitely takes a little massaging to work in, but not so much that it's impractical to use during my always-in-a-rush mornings.

The bottle says this can be used on the face.  I was unsure about that as my skin is sensitive and prone to breakouts, but I tried this cream on my face as I figured it would be so nice to be able to use just one product, especially during travel or at the gym.  Lo and behold, my face loves it!  My skin feels smooth, well-moisturized, and healthy.  No irritation or breakouts!

I recommend this body cream.  It's become a staple for me!",1528675200,2018-06-11

4.0,"J.A. Heckles makes lots of sharp things, some of the best kitchen knives (although those are under the 'Henckles' name, the J.A. Henckels are the lower line).  This nose and ear hair trimmer looks pretty amazing, and comes in a nice little plastic jewel like case.  It doesn't require any power so it makes it great to throw in a bag or in your car, anyplace you might notice some unsightly hair but you don't have something powered.  It's quiet and small.

Now the not so good.  The design of the tip isn't as good as some of the newer electric trimmers, those with open ended ones instead of circular.  I find it cuts ok, but not great, some slight snagging.  Ears work pretty good, but nose seems to be pretty hit or miss.

I'll probably throw it in my car so I always have something when I need it, but still continue using a battery powered one with a better tip on it.",1442534400,2015-09-18

4.0,"""Crown Me Already!"" (silver sparkle with various size glitter particles): This polish is amazing and got tons of comments, even from a guy that worked at Lowe's. Three coats are needed to get a solid diamond-like glitter from the nails, but after three days it started to chip off two of my nails, even with Seche Vite topcoat. The biggest problem I had was removal. This polish simply does not want to come off, even if you use a basecoat. It took nearly thirty minutes of intense scrubbing with pure acetone to finally remove the polish, and by that point my nails literally hurt. It is amazing but I will think twice about wearing this by itself again. This would NOT be good for a diamond-tip French manicure as some of the sparkles are quite large. It made the edges of my nails deadly-sharp and my boyfriend complained that I was scratching him. I even scratched my own face a few times.",1317340800,2011-09-30

5.0,"There are many reasons I love this product.  One, this is easy to use-I put it on for 5 to 10 minutes while I'm getting ready for a shower and by the time I'm ready to get in I can rinse it right off.  Second, it makes your face extremely smooth and soft.  Third, I've used a few different peels before and I like that this is for ""sensitive"" skin.  It tingles, and maybe has a ""slight"" sensation, but not BURNING like so many products do.  I usually don't leave it on the full 10 minutes but rather between 5 and 8 minutes.  That seems to be (for me) a perfect time range.  The only ""not so perfect"" thing about this product is that because it's winter-faces dry out much easier and for a day after I feel my face is exceptionally dry.  This does not hamper me from using the product by any means, it just means you need to follow up with a good moisturizer!  Overall, I loved this!",1416268800,2014-11-18

4.0,"This is an extremely nice, creamy serum that goes on like a wet lotion. It has a distinct fragrance that I wish were a little bit less strong given that I'm using it on my face, however even though I'm not a fan of highly scented products on my face, I will say that the fragrance is very pleasant and smells high-end. I'm used to using natural products like Lush that smell of identifiable botanicals, and this smells more like something you'd get at a high-end department store.

Just the right amount comes out with each pump, I found that I only needed one pump per use to cover my face and neck area. I've been doing the Korean 10 step skincare regimen outlined in Charlotte Cho's book The Little Book of Skincare about Korean skincare, in which she recommends starting with oil cleansing, moving onto a foam cleanser, exfoliater, toner, essence or serum, moisturizer, then sun protection. There are more details than that obviously, but in any case I am finding that this serum dovetails nicely with the other products I've chosen from Korean lines.

How much money is it worth? Well, I will say that I have found a number of highly recommended and effective serums for a variety of prices. I like a midrange one from Oz naturals, an inexpensive one from Benton with snail extracts and bee venom (!), and my very favorite is one from MitoQ which is outrageously priced but feels luxe and does an amazing, noticeable job. This one is a very nice serum and I like it a lot, however it is not so outstanding that I would pay an outstanding amount of money for it. Essences and serums from TonyMoly, Missha, Skinfood, Etude house, etc seem to do a similar job at a low price point and are highly rated by users.

Overall, this does an above-average job of moisturizing, brightening, and smoothing my skin on my face, even after a rough night up with the baby, I feel that my skin isn't giving away my lack of sleep. I wish the fragrance were much less potent, but it smells nice and didn't irritate my sensitive skin. However, it's not my top favorite, and I am not sure the results justify a high-end price point.

I have combination skin with sensitivities.",1466812800,2016-06-25

3.0,"I could not figure out how to use the dropper and the instructions said nothing about it. I don't see the point as it's messier than pouring foundation into your hand. In fact, the dropper spilled a drop on my outfit and stained it to the point it was worrisome whether it'd come out. It did. The reason it took work to get it out is because this has zinc oxide (for the sun protection). So you may want to be sure you're over the sink when applying it and not wearing your best clothes.

The color worked well for my pale skin and it made my face look even as best as it can. No product can make it look completely even. The scent was practically non-existent, which should please a lot of folks.

If you're using this for SPF protection, you'll need to reapply every two hours. Most people I know don't reapply foundation that often. So the SPF benefit isn't a great one as it'll mess up your blush. Better to use a clear lotion for SPF than foundation that is supposed to be the make up base. The button on top of the dropper isn't easy to press. Bliss needs to redesign the bottle to make it easier to apply without worrying about messes. I wouldn't count on this for sun protection unless I know I won't be gone more than two hours.",1468800000,2016-07-18
5.0,"When I opened the jar of cream I felt dubious at best.

It smelled faintly of minty toothpaste and it looked and had the consistency of what could best be described as opalescent Cool Whip.  Unlike anything I had ever willingly put on my face before.

And then I tried it...and loved it.

While it provides great lubrication similar to any good shaving cream, it stays in places and doesn't start running down my neck and face, and it doesn't feel like I just rubbed a bunch of lotion on my face either.  This product feels like it is meant to shave with.

While they recommend you use a brush, I just use my hands and spread it over the areas I want to shave.  The smell is very pleasant but not overwhelming, as is the coolness you get form the menthol, but not supercharged like it is with many shave gels that come out of a can.

The closeness of my shave is great, I feel like I get a closer shaves with one pass using this than any other shaving product.  While that may just be in my head, if I feel that way, it is good enough for me.

The residual left on my face washes of easy with a little water and a towel; I have had no problem with any irritation or razor burn using this stuff.

Overall a great product in my opinion is it priced higher than many, yes, but if I feel better leaving the house in the morning after using it, then I consider it worth it.

The oils do cause it to smell nice and it's not sticky or tacky, but when I've been wearing it a lot, I definitely notice that it dries out my lips, instead of moisturizing them.

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

5.0,"This Crabtree & Evelyn product lives up to the brand's high standard, with premium scent and feel commensurate with the high price. It's packaged attractively as well, in a metallic-feeling tube with a high-quality screw top within a cardboard outer box attractive enough to give as a gift. The product inside the tube is white and rich-feeling, adding a lot of moisture without an oily feeling; a little dab goes a long way. Its scent is sharply citron/citrus without much of an afternote, smelling nice when it goes on but fading fairly quickly as it should. When applied thinly, the product disappears into the skin in seconds, leaving it feeling soft and pleasant for several hours afterward it's a really nice cream for hands or faces. Do note that it's so rich-feeling because it's based on macadamia nut oil, which might be an allergy problem (I actually checked it with a friend with a nut allergy and found the product didn't provoke a reaction from momentary contact, but it's probably best to be cautious). Apart from that, it's highly recommended.",1457827200,2016-03-13

When I come home from work, I still use an oil cleanser (Clinique's Take the Day Off) as a first step, but then I use this as a second cleanser, and it seems to remove any last vestiges of makeup.  Your skin actually feels soothed and moisturized, rather than tight.

4.0,"I admit, I can't figure this scent out. I kept trying to find what the smells make me think of, and I suppose light musk  white a hint of citrus is what resonates with me.  From what I have read on another website, this is how they describe the smell, ""Top notes are basil, verbena, cardamom and juniper berries; middle notes are leather, patchouli and styrax; base notes are cedar, incense and tonka bean."".  I suppose that could be correct, it is unlike any scent my husband has and I am hoping he will like it.  Of course, I have to like it too, which I do, but I don't think I love it.  I imagine it will smell different when he wears it, so overall I feel  it is pleasant.  It is not a cloying, thick cloud of odoriferous scent.  I also find it interesting in comparing  how the eau de toilette smell is described, and to what  ingredients are in it, and they are: Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 39-C), Water, Fragrance, Limonene, Linalool, Sutyl Metroxydienenzylmethane, Benzyl Salicylate, Coumarin, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Hexyl Cinnamal, BHT, Citral, Citronellol, Geraniol, CI 60730 (Ext. Voilet 2), CI 19140 (Yellow 5), CI 17230 (Red 33).

I had my oldest teenage daughter smell it and she didn't really know how to describe it either, but she found it like-able also.  I have a bottle of the essential oil of patchouli, so I compared it to that, and I can see a slight similarity, but thankfully the Burberry smells better than plain patchouli. And for the price, it better.  My other daughter could still smell the cologne a few hours after I spray tested it and she said it was ""okay"".  Kids these days!

In all this is a unique smell for me, and will round out his collection of colognes.  The bottle is quite fancy and manly too.",1448582400,2015-11-27
3.0,"I have very curly hair and usually use John Frieda's Frizz Ease Secret Weapon touch-up creme. It does a great job of keeping my hair smooth and in ringlets or less defined curls depending on how much I want to put in. It costs about $6 at any grocery store or convenience store. When I have ordered this product, priced $25, I have expected a lot more from it than from a $6 alternative. My curls felt a bit more glossier and that is ALL! I used it several times just to account for weather, my hair's moods and styles, but it did not do anything more than other much better priced products. The hair stayed soft and lightweight, frizz free and defined, but there are several other products under $10 that do the same. I guess I was looking for a lot more for the price.

4.0,"Lee is Superfood Facial Oil helps keep my skin hydrated, glowing, and looking good. In the fall/winter my skin gets drier than the warmer months. Over the summer I was able to use the Elemis oil in the morning under my moisturizer/sunscreen. I have pale skin and need to use a product that has sunscreen in it. The oil takes a few minutes to absorb so I only used it under my moisturizer/sunscreen if I had time to let the oil sit and absorb. I could get away with using the oil at night time without an evening moisturizer. Now that it's fall I need to use a thicker evening moisturizer. So once again I only use the oil when it has time to absorb.

The oil does have a mild scent. It doesn't bothers me. The packaging is very nice. It feels like a thick sturdy expensive bottle. The dropper has a rounded tip making it feel more luxurious than a traditional dropper. Just a few drops covers my face, so this product has lasted me. If you are in the market for a new facial oil, I'd recommend trying the Elemis Superfood Facial Oil.",1507161600,2017-10-05

I'm not saying women couldn't use this, but it has a smell of beachy and more dense flavors then the light and airy scents women are used to. Either way, I like it.

I often find that moisturizers leave a little too much of a sheen on my skin, and would rather have a substance that leaves my skin looking healthy but dry rather than looking like I forgot to dry my face after a shower, or like I've just spread a thin, albeit clean, film of motor oil on my cheeks. The feel of this smoothing product is unlike any other product I've tried, sort of like running a thin film of silk onto my skin. The liquid leaves my face feeling well moisturized throughout the day, without the dry chapped skin that I often get in the winter, but without looking like I've used ""product."" Does it actually smooth out wrinkles? Well, perhaps the very fine lines around my eyes, but more than that hasn't responded to any over-the-counter product.

I didn't feel a tingling sensation as it stated it might.  The most surprising part of using this lotion is how much it brightened and smoothed my complexion.  The spf is just an added benefit.  I will continue to use this as a moisturizer and facial sunscreen.",1524614400,2018-04-25

5.0,"This is an awesome set of authentic replacement brushes for any Clarisonic. The Sensitive brush has been my ""go to"" brush I used exclusively with a Clarisonic Pro for about nine years with great results. It's comfortable to my sensitive skin and has resulted in noticeably brighter and cleaner skin than hand washing or using other cleansing gadgets. My dry skin absorbs my serums and creams better, so my skin stays more hydrated, more comfortable and my fine lines are minimized. My skin texture is definitely smoother and softer and regular use has visibly improved my overall skin quality.

I splurged on a Mia FIT about seven months ago (my Pro handle doesn't hold a charge as long as it use to), and it came with the Radiance brush. So I've used Radiance awhile now, and to me it feels similar to the Sensitive brush. They both seem to use the same soft bristles, except Radiance also has those softer bristles in the center. It also feels slightly more plush with denser and slightly longer bristles than the Sensitive brush. Radiance feels good on my sensitive skin and is an excellent everyday brush that gives me the same results as the Sensitive brush.

I've also used the Deep Pore brush regularly (but not daily) over the past five months or so to focus on pores by my nose. The bristles are also quite soft, but do feel a little firmer and more stimulating than the Radiance and Sensitive brushes. Some may enjoy it as an everyday brush, though I prefer the other brushes for everyday use. I do, however, like it as a complement to another brush to use a few times a week as it does seem to help lift gunk from my problem pores.

The big surprise in this set is the Cashmere brush. I hadn't tried it until recently, and I absolutely love it. It combines shorter and taller uber soft bristles and has a noticeably different feel than the other brushes in this set. I find myself gravitating to using it more than the others as it's so plush and comforting to my dry, sensitive skin and feels so enjoyable and luxurious. Plus, it does a fabulous job getting my skin clean and preparing it for my serums and creams. I'm in my 50's with dry, sensitive skin, and it's perfect for my skin type and may be my new favorite. This is an excellent set with four different, high quality Clarisonic brushes. 5 stars.

I've completely radicated face washes, like the Cetaphil face cleanser which I've been using for years, and replaced it entirely with this. My skin LOVES this. Since replacing my makeup wipes + face cleansers with this product, my skin has cleared up, I've had no breakouts, my skin tone is even and bright, no redness, no excessive oilyness, no dry patches, and my skin looks the best it's every looked. I usually wear a full face of make up (Foundation, concealer, mascara, etc.) and this removes all of my makeup with ease. L'Occitane is a great line, but this face oil takes the cake. It is a little pricey for an everyday face wash, but I feel you can never be too careful when it comes to your skin, especially your face. This product is worth every penny. One pump is all you need so this 6 ounce bottle will last you a very long time. Smells heavenly. Highly, highly recommend.",1470960000,2016-08-12
1.0,"This polish is either old, defective or ZOYA hasn't figured out how to combine performance with less toxic ingredients. As soon as it dried on my nails, many tiny lines formed across the surface of my nails. It was the strangest thing, almost like the polish was cracking. I hadn't even moved my hands! I removed the polish, shook the bottle well and tried again but the same thing happened! I then took it with me to a professional salon for a manicure and ended up with the same results so it definitely doesn't have to do with my application. Unfortunately, I can't return it because I threw the box away (because who expects to have to return a bottle of nail polish?) so I guess I am out the $10. :-( This was also my first experience with this brand (ZOYA).

3.0,"The colors are much more orange on me, after Smashbox 24 Hour Eyeshadow primer or swatched on my hand, than they look in the pan or on my screen--they look the same in person and on my Macbook Air, for the record. They are easy to apply smoothly, and did not flake, but the lighter shade is a very metallic gold that stays shiny in, to me, an unflattering way--obviously, of that's the look you are going for--I prefer a more blurred Hourglass Ambient look with less flat-out shine. The darker color has that blur quality more, but is far more copper on me than the soft toasted tan it looks in the pan. I think there's some copper shimmer? It's a bit more obvious than I was looking for, but does highlight my eye color.
For the record, I have a medium for a white person, neutral under-toned complexion with reddish overtones, dark ash brunette, with hazel eyes--the color of green olives with a coppery ring in the middle.",1467763200,2016-07-06

4.0,"Let's just say that I am a woman of ""a certain age"" whose face shows it.  I have long given up on looking like a 20-something, heck, even a 30-something.  So while I think it would be great for my visible lines to become invisible, my main expectations for a face cream these days are to moisturize and feel good.  Based on these criteria, the NUXE cream works well.  It goes on a bit thick (it's definitely a cream, not a lotion), but it has a smooth, non-greasy feel, and after I've applied it, it doesn't feel heavy on my face.  It also possesses a light, not unpleasant fragrance. I like how my facial skin feels after I've applied it.

Does it really get rid of visible lines?  On that, I'm agnostic.  I've been using it for several weeks now, and I can't say I've noticed much--indeed, any--difference.  But like I said, my expectations were low to begin with on that count.  (I've had my hopes dashed by expensive serums and creams before.)  I do like how it makes my skin feel, and that's enough for me.

One caveat:  The NUXE cream does not, as far as I can tell, include any kind of sunscreen, so I wouldn't suggest relying solely on it.  I apply a moisturizer with sunscreen on top of the NUXE cream in the mornings.",1417651200,2014-12-04

This was not what I was expecting, of course I got this with my husband in mind but I first tried it out myself. My first opinion was that it was very strong and the smell did not dissipate, I was not impressed with the scent at all it reminded me of someone smoking cigars or a pipe.

I thought maybe I just don't have taste and that this stuff smells awesome but something was wrong with me.  Unfortunately my husband also did not like it, when he smelled it he got a little on his beard and it stayed on there for hours and he kept commenting throughout the day that he could still smell it.

4.0,"The Menaji CAMO concealer is a good a general use concealer in a very convenient, easy to carry packaging. Having said that, the concealer is of a ticker mud-ish consistency which (depending on your skin tone) might require quite a bit of blending to not be obvious. While not specifically listed as non comedogenic, the concealer did not feel heavy or blocking when applied (although I wouldn't call it ""light"" either). If you have serious issues with breakouts due to pore blockage, you may want to find something specifically listed as non comedogenic instead of risking it. It is listed as hypoallergenic - I don't have sensitive skin, but I did not notice any reaction from use.

I received the ""Light"" coloring and I would say that the description is pretty accurate. I generally have a light/medium skin tone and the concealer, once blended in, is a decent match. While not perfect, it's not painfully obvious that I'm wearing concealer either.  At the time of this review, this product was priced in the mid-twenties, making it a low-to-mid-ranged price for most concealers. When compared to similar brands, there are some really good names out there that - while not specifically marketed towards men - are awesome products. Personally I think I'd pick up a Nars, Make Up Forever, or Urban Decay instead. However this concealer performed decently well (but I'd still keep my Nars close at hand).",1445299200,2015-10-20

4.0,"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1476835200,2016-10-19
3.0,"I bought this powder compact along with the accompanying liquid foundation and concealer from a daily ipsy deal.  I believe the set of 3 was $22, and it was my first experience with the em Cosmetics line.  The powder arrived in the color sand, and it will only work in the summer on my skin.  I'm usually light in the winter and light/medium in the summer.

The compact was larger than expected considering the amount of product in there.  The positives about the compact are that the whole inside of the lid is a mirror and it feels very sturdy.  I have already used it traveling a few times, and not only was the large mirror very handy, the compact held up well.  The compact comes with a round applicator, and I only tried it once because it applied the powder in a way that ended up looking cakey.  Once I started applying the powder with a brush, I had much better results.  The powder applied smoothly and it evened out the redness of my skin.  I have very sensitive, acne-prone oily skin.  The em Cosmetics powder did not irritate my skin and it lasted about 3-4 hours before I would start to look shiny and the coverage started to fade.  Since I don't reapply during the day, it's important that my foundation and powder last as long as possible, so the 3-4 hour life of the powder on my skin is a deal-breaker for me.  I tried it with my normal liquid foundation as well as the em Cosmetics foundation, and performance was the same with both.

I have used everything from drugstore powders up through high end and luxury powders and I can say that I'm happy with the price that I paid for this foundation as part of the set that I ordered.  When I looked it up to see how much the regular price is, I was very surprised.  I have no issue paying more for a better performing product, but this product doesn't perform better than some drugstore powders.  I'm still on the hunt for something better.",1473379200,2016-09-09

The product goes on like silk, completely dry with no sticky or greasy feel and leaves a matte finish.

The scent of all of the products I have tried is fresh and clean. If this scent was made into a day parfume it would sell out.

Marine Creams are all the rage, and this gel-to-cream formulation, helps to moisturize my skin.  Antiaging ingredients help improve the look of my skin while helping to reduce lines. I  never miss a day without a moisturizer and this one is light enough to apply under my makeup or to wear just by itself. This is Top of The Line and Top Quality. This is both light and non-greasy. The Pro-Collagen Marine Cream is formulated with marine algae, padina pavonica, porphyridium, and ginkgo biloba.

I use this every morning. I apply a pea-size amount into my hands, and gently smooth over my face and  neck. My face feels much smoother and softer. I have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles or lines. This product is expensive, but well worth the money. Only a very small amount is needed.

Shade is not too dark and it is much better alternative to put some color to the face than tanning.  This product requires a very little application and it is easy to spread out.  I put it over my daily moisturizer.  It has double duty: it provides SPF 25 skin protection form the sun and provides skin a beautiful tan coverage.  This product is not marketed as foundation but rather as a ""smooth liquid camo"" product.  It covers skin imperfections such as discolorations, blemishes and rosacea flare ups.

That way if they have to go about their day they get nice even coverage and sun protection.  This product has active ingredient titanium dioxide (sunscreen) 6.8%.  It appears that Dermablend is a skin care line created by Loreal.  This product comes in 1.0 oz size and it can be easily squeezed out of plastic bottle.",1498176000,2017-06-23
5.0,This is my new favorite toothpaste. I suffer from dry mouth from medication. Normal toothpaste makes my mouth so dry and dry mouth toothpaste tastes horrible.

4.0,"I wear eye shadow only for special occasions, but this is much nicer than the cheap stuff I usually buy. It comes in a lovely little solid compact with a mirror, but no brush. It went on smoothly and evenly and was very long lasting. I would have preferred a darker shade; this is a pale beige shade, good for highlighting under the brow. The one problem with matte powder shadows like this is that they tend to make eyelids on us older people look crepey, and this is no exception. But it still a very nice product.",1421452800,2015-01-17

5.0,"I like to have cleansing cloths in my bathroom for when I come home from a night out. I am almost always too tired to do a complicated makeup removal. Cleansing Cloths make it much easier and quicker. I have been using them for years, but this is my first time trying them from skyn.

I LOVE how the ICELAND Glacial cloths soothe my eyes. They are so relaxing on tired skin. I think I may even start using them after long nights at work when my eyes are sore too. I did feel a tiny bit of burning in my eye . However, I think that is because I was trying to get every bit of my eye makeup off including my eyeliner.

The only issue that I have with these cloths is that they are really only best for the eyes. If I am wearing eye makeup, I am also wearing face makeup that needs to be removed. I tried to use these cloths on my face and the ""icy hot"" feeling irritated my facial skin. It turned my face bright red and inflamed. It was fine again the next morning, but I am not going to use them on my face again. So, I really have to use two cloths if I use these to remove makeup after a night out. Other than that, I really like the soothing effect.",1479686400,2016-11-21
4.0,"I've tried several of the Dermablend foundations and this one is my favorite.

MY MAKEUP and Me -- I'm an older mom with super sensitive skin which is also dry these days... except on my forehead.  I don't wear a lot of makeup by preference.  My life just doesn't demand it now, but there are times when I go out that I would like freckles, small red veins, and whatnot covered.

And while other Dermablend foundations covered they were too thick and heavy and I guess now that I don't wear makeup every day, I'm sensitive to the weight.

THIS foundation though was light and had good coverage. I really liked the narrow tip that it dispenses from. It is liquid and very very easy to apply.  It didn't irritate my skin at all.  It also wasn't greasy.  It finishes as a nice matte.  The only place where coverage wasn't perfect for me was on my forehead.  Note that it's in the mid-90s outside and the humidity is very high.  And I've found that if I don't want to look shiny I need to dust a little free powder over the foundation on my forehead.",1499990400,2017-07-14

4.0,"This is a very good, all purpose day-long facial moisturizing lotion. The product is thick, white lotion neutral in scent and appearance  - and once rubbed into the skin it absorbs easily and efficiently without leaving behind chalky residue. Moisturizing qualities are very good and results are quite apparent when rubbed into dried out skin. The moisture benefits really do hold up quite well and really does last a full day provided you're mostly indoors. It is a costly product so I do recommend trying out a sample first if you're able to get a hold of some.",1488499200,2017-03-03
4.0,"This Radiance and Repair product seems to work.  I really like that it's a spray on formulae as I worry sometimes with the ""gloopy"" stuff that I'll use too much and it will be a problem to rinse it all out.  You basically just shampoo as usual, rinse, and spritz this Oribe on your hair and leave it for about 3 minutes.  That's it - then rinse it out and towel dry as usual.

The product is blue and has almost no odor so it doesn't linger or oppose your cologne or fragrance.  I really like this because so many products today have a strong smell, this just has a very light clean aroma. I must admit that I'm put off by the price point which for my lifestyle is our of teach.

However, I am not one to waste retinol so I have been using it as a localized treatment on my age spots. Here, the density of this cream seems to work in my advantage as it stays right where I apply it. It seems to be as effective as other retinol preparations at reducing rough areas and diminishing dark spots. Id be unlikely to buy it for this purpose due to the expense but it it is a handy, no waste source of retinol right now.",1523059200,2018-04-07

4.0,"This item was given to me for my review.
Originally, I did not like the Japonesque Radiance Primer. I felt it was too thick and made little sense to use. However, I read some of the other reviews and tried it with my skin cream. I use Vanicream http://www.amazon.com/Vanicream-Lite-Lotion-8-Ounce/dp/B000TCWX68/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1415724154&sr=8-13&keywords=vanicream, and I mention it specifically because it has no additional fragrances and works well with my extremely sensitive skin. I don't know what would happen if one mixed this primer with a moisturizer that has fragrance. Just saying. Anyway, I applied moisturizer first, let it sink in, then applied the primer and moisturizer mixed together over the top. I liked it very much that way. It gave my cheeks that glow, even after I applied my dry foundation. This would be excellent for someone who does not wear makeup, but would like to give their face a fresher look. I know as we age, our skin can get a ash-like coloring, so this is a nice solution...or if we are just looking tired, and as a wife and mother, that is relatively often. It works with or without foundation. So, yes, I am glad that I took the time to find out if I was using it correctly or if there was a better way to make it work for me. It is a shame that products do not come with suggestions like in the reviews, but perhaps the company will rethink their packaging. Giving customers options means the product has a better chance of being successful.",1415664000,2014-11-11
2.0,"I've heard very good things about this brand, and was excited to try this cleanser. I'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so I keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). This cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal.

Pros:
1. Only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer
2. Rinses clean, without residue
3. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin
4. Doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean
5. Doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse

Cons:
1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the ""cooling action"" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the ""cleansing"" part.
2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes.
3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something.
4. Expensive. Considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. I've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. If I'm spending more, I'd rather invest in Algenist or La Mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).

Overall, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this cleanser.",1486080000,2017-02-03

5.0,"First off, I LOVE the CND Shellac polish.  I love having my nails look great all the time with minimal effort.  If I go to the salon for a Shellac manicure it lasts about 10 days, only about 7 if I do it myself.  I think the problem I have is I make the 2 coats of color too thick, but I'm getting better at that.  The entire color starts to lift and then I end up peeling it off, which is horrible for the nail bed.  I've started just removing it the correct way after one week to avoid have the color lift like that.

This color is amazing though, I have gotten more compliments on this color then anything I have tried before.  It is the perfect deep red wine/raisin color and stays wonderfully shiny until I remove it.",1339372800,2012-06-11

5.0,"The cream is thick = a 1/4"" bead is enough to thoroughly cover elbow and surrounding area or back of both hands.
It soaks in quickly and completely in about 5 seconds and works well to soften rough dry skin.

The cream provides/leaves a protective healing film of Shea butter on skin,
which is an excellent moisturizer and has exceptional healing properties.

The butter is noticeable by water beading up on back of hands.
Some folks may want to wash off palms. (requires soap)

Testing cream on only one elbow = upon which there are noticeable differences.
The Baxter elbow is tamed silky soft, and skin (briefly) very slightly cooler with lasting feeling of skin hydrated.

Not sure why Baxter hydro salve is targeted for men's grooming other than it's extra thick and contains zero fragrance,
but both genders of our family enjoy using the cream.",1441584000,2015-09-07

1.0,"UPDATE: Began to burn my eyes after a few uses. They stung so much. I will never use this Vichy or recommend because of the burning. I don't understand why it hurt so bad after a few uses.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (Four Stars): The Vichy Normaderm 3-in-1 Micellar Water Facial Cleanser is good, but I felt like my skin still had cosmetic residue on it after I used this product with a cotton pad. I had an unstoppable urge to wash my face with water & regular cleanser after using this, which I did. My skin felt much cleaner after that.

The cleanser also spilled into the sink because it pours oddly, so just make sure to put your cotton pad over the hole before upturning the bottle. This is great stuff for removing my (not-waterproof) mascara, but I will probably follow up with my regular cleanser.

I like this to take off makeup, but won't recommend to fully remove dirt and cosmetics all over your face.",1477785600,2016-10-30

The scent is not typical, but it doesn't bother me. It takes a very small amount to wash my face, so this container will last longer than I expected.
 I have also used the Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum.  The feel and texture of this serum is very nice, and the smell is pleasant without being overpowering. My skin is fragile due to ongoing chemotherapy, so I am always looking for a moisturizer or something similar to protect my skin. I think this is a winner.

If you are a woman and have a purse, it's a different story. What I do is keep the comb at home for grooming after a shower. The comb is very well constructed as you might expect from its price. The use for which this comb excels is as an out of the shower and styling comb. It is perfect for working rapidly and effectively with thick, wet hair. It is also great for working with hair that was sprayed with hairspray and styled right out of the shower and is now dry. The comb works easily through hair that might stop a flimsy comb.",1390262400,2014-01-21

That being said, this sensitive skin cream is not my favorite.  I enjoy their classic scent much more than this one, and I can't say as though I noticed any additional protection from the sensitive skin cream vs. classic.

3.0,"As I have gotten older (late 40s now), I have become more interested in using retinol-based products to keep my skin looking healthy and to minimize the appearance of some of the growing lines and wrinkles.  This product seemed to be in the retinol range that was about right for me, so I was interested in trying it, and I have been using it nightly for about three weeks now--perhaps not yet enough time to see major changes, but I wanted to provide at least a preliminary review.

The good news is that I have not experienced any skin problems related to this product.  I know that retinol can cause breakouts, and I was concerned about this, especially given that I can be prone to acne, but I have not had this issue at all, so I was pleased.  In terms of improvement in my skin's appearance, I haven't noticed anything major.  It does seem like on the mornings after I use the product, my skin has a slightly more ""tight"" appearance--i.e., drier, less oily than usual.  But otherwise, I will need to continue l using the product for long to see whether I experience more significant benefits.

The major downside to this product is the packaging.  It comes in a small squeeze tube with a pull-off cap. To dispense the produce, you must squeeze the tube, and there is a TINY hole at the top which releases the product.  This process is VERY difficult, and it has only become harder as I have used the product.  This past past week, when I was squeezing the tube, the entire top popped off, and the product splattered all over.  (Note:  this has happened to other reviewers as well.)  The tube wasn't very fully to begin with, so it is disappointing to lose product in this manner.  Plus, the top will NOT pop back on, so now I have to reach into the exposed tube itself to use the product, which isn't particularly sanitary.

Based on my knowledge so far, I would be hesitant to recommend this product.  However, I will keep using it and will report back if I see improved results.",1487116800,2017-02-15

I used the ivory color which blended in perfectly underneath my eyes for a quick fix.

 I noticed an immediate decrease in small wrinkles on my face and immediate relief to my super dry skin.  It has a slight fragrance but that goes away quickly and it soaks into your skin rapidly.  I find that applying this over a small layer of regular night cream (let that soak in for 10 -15 minutes first) really helps keep the moisture in.  You don't need a lot of product to cover your face.  It contains dimethicone which is proven to seal in moisture.

It has a pleasant, fresh smell, something I've never had the pleasure of with a tanning spray.

The only downside is the price. I got two legs out of this, and from the feel, there seems to be enough for one, maybe two more sessions. That's a pricey tan!",1435363200,2015-06-27
3.0,"For the price point I was really expecting something amazing, and while it's good, this mascara doesn't quite fit that bill. While it doesn't clump or irritate (and is definitely VERY waterproof), the applicator is average at best. It also doesn't make lashes look fuller or longer; basically it just gives them color. It does what it says it should do, and nothing more, so again, for the price point it's just okay.",1487894400,2017-02-24

4.0,"I think the people who didn't like this product were expecting something more like a lipstick. This Michelle Phan product is a 'lip balm'.  It's supposed to stick to your lips --sort of like Blistex Lip balm-- and give them some protection.  And to my mind it's like a tinted EOS balm, except without the scent.

As a balm it's okay. The 'berries' color that I received is a dark wine color. It has a vanilla scent which is pleasant. (no berries)  It is a dark color for a young girl but it looks okay on me.  (No, I won't get to keep it.  I have a 14 yo daughter and she'll be thrilled to 'borrow' this.)

SUMMARY
The photos of this product don't do it justice. The little jar of balm comes in a cute little box that would be giftable to a teen or younger girl. You can't see it but the container has a clear raised dome over the ""em"" icon.  This dome makes the product look much nicer than the photo.

As far as quality, it's mid-range. This PLUSH CUSHIONY LIP BALM is somewhat sticky like other lip balms and lip glosses.  It doesn't have a fruity scent though the way EOS lip balms do.

As far as PRICE => I look at this way. This is a VERY AFFORDABLE way to treat my daughter to a bit of Michelle Phan fun. We bond over her videos while watching them together, and this is an easy purchase that she'll love.  One that won't break the bank.

That said, I don't think this is a product most women my age are going to go 'oooh' over.

Recommend for the right age.",1417478400,2014-12-02

5.0,"Truthfully, having read a few reviews before ordering this, I was a little nervous that this would turn my face orange, but it didn't.

First a few comments:
It was extremely thick and I had a little difficulty squeezing some out of the tube
The shade is a medium shade that would not work on very fair people
There was no obvious scent - a definite plus
Spread nicely on skin and could be worn alone
Definitely more CC cream than primer

I have skin color that most cosmetic companies call ""light"" - not very pale, or medium. So this cream was a little bit dark on me, but only a little. This cream was very thick, and rich, and only had the slightest hint of a silicone feel. Honestly, I thought it looked great on its own. The fact that it's a mineral sunscreen is great - no irritation like you get with regular sunscreen - and it has a fabulous 50 SPF. I have very sensitive skin and was really happy that this didn't cause any itching or irritation. It is a tiny bit dark on me, so I'm sure I'll wear it way more in the summer. This is a great product.",1460419200,2016-04-12

I wouldn't say that I saw a huge difference in making any wrinkles disappear, but it did a good job of tightening my skin, and making it appear healthier, so for that I like it.

5.0,"I had a huge allergic flareup to something and my face...it was horrible. Crusty, raw skin, red swollen eyes. I had to stop using my Lancome, Elizabeth Arden, and Estee Lauder products (had a pile to work through) because their fragrance was torturing my skin more. I even resorted to using CeraVe and Cetaphil creams as that normally works, and my skin just felt like the moisture wasn't penetrating my skin. The skin under my eyes was so dry that makeup made me look like a sun-worshipping 100 year old woman.  The Bioderma cream (and other Bioderma products that came through Vine) were a lifesaver! This cream moisturizes better than the Lancome Hydra Zen (cost 2x as much) and no fragrance to irritate my skin. I won't be reordering the Lancome.

It's very hard purchasing OUR products online as we have to actually be somewhere that we can actually test the product before we buy it.

Needless to say this product was too light and didn't have any brown pigments in it. It did eventually blend in when I applied darker foundation, and it set well when I used the translucent concealing powder, but it took some time to blend it.

It did last all day, but honestly, I can't tell if it was the concealer or the foundation that I mixed in with it. I will try a darker color and pray it's not too dark.",1497657600,2017-06-17

Cleaning power is so-so.  To take off my mascara, I need to follow-up with make-up remover.  Of course, this product does not claim to remove make-up, so I did not remove any stars for it.

5.0,"I have bought my wife lots of perfume over the years, but find that I can't stand the powerful ones.  So I was on the look for something very light.  I like the light smell, but it matters if the person wearing it likes it more.  So I asked my wife to comment.  She says,

""A light, floral scent, definitely suited for Spring and Summer.  I don't have a ""nose"" so can't tell you exactly what florals I do smell.

According to information found on the internet, it has ""top notes"" of: cherry blossom, mandarin, bergamot; ""mid notes"" of: violet, pastel rose accord and syringa; and  ""base notes"" of bamboo, sandalwood and bare musk accord.  I don't smell musk (which I don't like) and it's not a heavy scent.  Not too sure about sandalwood, either, (but I do like that scent on my man).

Information from the internet also states that Endless Euphoria is the ""daytime counterpart to Euphoria.  Now we have daytime and night-time scents?  So I have to buy two kinds of perfume - daytime and nighttime?  Good marketing ploy - for the rich or those who have too much money on their hands.  (Say, if you have too much money, why don't you send me the amount you would spend on either the daytime or nighttime version, and we'll both be happy!)

Not an overpowering scent, and I'm noticing it doesn't linger/last ""forever"", so you might want to get a small, purse-size one to carry with you to refresh scent throughout the day, if you're one of those ladies (me, I'm just a once-in-the-morning-does-it kind of gal), or layering is good - body-wash, powder/lotion, scent.""

Now my wife gives it a 4, as it is light and disappears after awhile.  I give it a 5 because it is LIGHT.  A heavy or even medium perfume is too much for me to be around.  So since I am rating it gets a 5.  However, to the ladies who would actually wear it, please think about what my wife said if you want a stronger scent.  I really hope this helps.  It is so hard looking for the perfect perfume that everyone around can like.",1426896000,2015-03-21

This lightweight, fragrance-free lotion goes on smoothly and feels good on my skin, absorbing right away without the greasiness, residue or lumpiness Ive experienced with other suntan lotions in the past. The active ingredients are octinoxate, octisalate and 8% zinc oxide, which are meant to protect skin against UVA and UVB rays and infrared-A.  The promise is that it offers antiaging repair and it will take time for me to be able to affirm that claim.  The lotion does need to be reapplied at least every two hours and at this price, its a true investment in your skin.

5.0,"I never thought I'd actually crave an expensive grooming set in my life. I've always been content with cheap drugstore grooming kit, but this just blew my mind. This is German engineering at its finest.

The case was well made - every item in the kit fit into a neat, well-thought out custom slots. The nail clipper is something out of this world - it looks like it was designed by Porsche and it was a pleasure to clip my nails and not an annoying chore I have to do. I can't even look at my old nail clipper any more. There were no sharp edges left nor did it feel like it would tear at my nails.

I'm familiar with Zwilling - I have two of their kitchen knives and they are the workhorse in the kitchen - they feel just right and are used all the time.  This grooming set is one of these things I'm kicking myself for not getting earlier in my life. Everything feels like it was made out of high quality metal and designed by engineers who have meticulously thought out every use of these.

Now the price: $179 is a lot of money to spend on a kit. This is most definitely a luxury item. I'd have a hard time justifying this as a purchase to myself, but would gladly gift it to someone as an amazing gift that I hope they'd never lose.

5.0,"I had seen the Marvis toothpastes before and always wondered why in the world anyone would spend a whopping 10 dollars on a toothpaste. That was until recently when an order I had placed on the web included a tiny sample tube of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvis-Classic-Strong-Mint-Toothpaste/dp/B000J56ZZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvis Classic Strong Mint Toothpaste</a>. Every night (and day) I found myself reaching for that one rather than my old toothpaste (which shall remain unnamed) because I loved the strong mint flavor and the overall clean and fresh feeling in my mouth. I was intrigued and went on to google Marvis. That's when I found out about the Jasmin Mint flavor and - a bit skeptically - ordered the smaller travel size, just in case I wouldn't like what seemed like a strange combination of flowery and minty.

However, I am very happy to report that this is a truly great flavor. The mint is not quite as strong as in the original but that's just as well since it enables the taste buds to actually notice the jasmine which tastes exactly like jasmine tea and is perfectly balanced with the mint. Not icky, not yucky, not strange, not artificial, just extremely pleasant and wonderfully unique. Who would have thought that brushing one's teeth can actually be an experience and not just something one does because it must be done. I, for one, am hooked and plan to next order the big tube and simply ignore the fact that it is really crazy to spend 10 dollars on a toothpaste :-)",1262736000,2010-01-06

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29
4.0,"This is a beautifully packaged gift set with a 3.3 oz bottle and TWO rollerballs for your purse/travel.  I absolutely love to have rollerballs of favorite scents for travel.  The bottle is rectangular shaped with etched glass. It looks very nice and classy in my perfume collection.  Only negative with packaging is that the cap does not stay on well.  It rests on the top and can easily fall off if you're not careful.

This scent is very different from the Burberry Brit EDT.  I actually have a 1.7 oz of Brit EDT and it was my gateway perfume.  The original Brit is a spicier, muskier scent and I think of it as a heavier, nighttime winter scent.  Burberry Brit Rhythm Floral is lighter with a bit of citris - perfect for year-round use.

Official Notes are:
British Lavender, Orange Blossom, Vetiver, Musks.

To me, this is a clean scent, like soap.  This isn't a bad thing at all - it fits well with scents I typically like (e.g. Michael Kors Daisy, Versace Pink Crystal) and I could see myself wearing it to work from September to April.  It is less overpowering than the Burberry Brit and it is great for daytime.  The throw doesn't seem to be super to me.  I can't really smell myself all day in the same way as I can smell myself with Brit or with Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb, although I know the scent lingers.

Overall, this is nice scent but it isn't really super special or unique.  I don't see this as appealing to true perfume afficionados.  If you like ""clean"" smelling fragrances, however, you should give this a try.",1445472000,2015-10-22

4.0,I have tried other Vichy creams and like them.  This cream has Rhamnose in it which is supposed to be an anti aging ingredient.  This cream has a thick consistency but does not leave my skin greasy.  I have just started using it and will return to update this when the jar is empty.  This cream is more expensive than the creams I usually buy so I will need to see results before purchasing this.  So far I do like it though.,1453593600,2016-01-24
5.0,"I love this hair spray.  Since I first found this brand and type several years ago I refuse to use anything else.  Yes it is a bit pricey but it works great!  I love how lightweight it feels,  It lasts all day long without breaking down.  I also like the smell too.  It doesn't have the strange alcohol odor that some do.  Overall a great product.  No complaints at all about it.",1519776000,2018-02-28
5.0,"Because of my sensitive skin, I usually use very gentle facial cleansers and shaving products.  Discovering them was great, but I also discovered that a lack of any exfoliation can lead to blemishes and a certain puffy look.  I have used Billy Jealousy products and generally like them, with the exception of the big plastic beads that they've switched to in their exfoliating cleansers.  It works worse and can spread bacteria.  The philosophy brand uses small gritty particle that do a much better job of buffing off dry skin and leaving my face looking renewed.  It says it is fine for daily use, but I wonder if that might age the skin prematurely.  As with other exfoliators, I only use it a couple times a week.

The only issue you might have with this product is that it is mostly fragrance free, and what is there is just neutral.  That's good to avoid any potential for skin or sinus irritation, but also boring.",1463097600,2016-05-13

3.0,"This is a shimmer spray with sun protection - when looking at it it's actually easy to think now what shall I do with this and where shall I put it (it's a spray so you won't be spraying this on your face btw).  It's presentation is absolutely lovely and you feel like you are getting a really high end product.  The spray goes on with a very light sheen - not a glittery spray. It's not enough that someone would look at you and ask what you have on....at least not as far as appearance.  I thought the smell was just too strong.  I didn't like it because of that but I'm very sensitive to smells so I thought it should be much more subtle, especially of you want to put in on a large portion of your body.  Simply spraying it on my forearms I felt like I had coated myself with perfume.  My mom liked it however and said she didn't much notice the smell and she liked having that SPF on her arms as well as the soft glow.

4.0,"While the instructions state to use gel in the shower or right after showering, I had to test it out when the hair is dry and coarse (not after it softens up).

The gel is easy to apply, no rocket science.  My husband used a shaving machine mustache trimmer and had no problem removing the gel.  After he was done, he stated the hair was softer and easier to remove.  His face felt hydrated and there was no irritation whatsoever.  Other shaving gels usually leave a sticky feeling on his face, but not this one.

The scent is pleasant if you just sniff it but it can get overwhelming when you actually leave it on for a few minutes (which you must), not sure how to describe the scent and this might bother some people only.",1482364800,2016-12-22

I do think $65 is a high price for a small amount of serum which is not coming directly from a physician's prescription. But, after having used this now for a while I think it is an amazing serum and a must have for anyone's aging skin. Skip the doctor's office and spas and try this first.

The smell is very pleasant and surprising. My spouse liked it a lot, as did our two daughters. It's rare to find unified appreciation like that in this house. It actually reminds me of my uncle's pipe, the only tobacco I ever appreciated smelling. It's subtly sweet with perhaps a very light smokiness that is neither distracting nor overpowering. Very pleasant, and I enjoy wearing it.

The theming is great with the vintage-looking bottle and the awesome cardboard box with the stamp and themed sticker. It makes this a cool and interesting experience overall.",1473984000,2016-09-16

5.0,"First, thank you, bliss, for focusing more on what's inside the jar than what's on the outside. The label does not tout ""clinical trials"" or ""99.9% reduction in wrinkles/redness/brownness;"" no miracles are promised, just hydration. The cream -- if I can call it that, because it's not really creamy in the conventional sense -- has a cool, silky texture. Rub in a dollop and your skin feels softer but not greasy. The scent is so faint you may not even notice it.

Because the product is packaged in a jar, you will want to use it with a small spatula or other scooper to minimize bacterial contamination. It's almost always a good idea to spend some time rubbing in creams. Thirty seconds is longer than you might think, but since my toothbrush beeps every 30 seconds, I realized I could multi-task: toothbrush in one hand, drench 'n' quench in the other. Pretty brilliant, huh?

Before I received this product to try, I bought a similar blue water-cream (whose name also begins with a lowercase b) that's being heavily sampled and promoted. Doing a side-by-side comparison, I prefer the bliss version for better hydration and less intrusive scent. If you are looking for a new experience in moisturizing, check out the d & q as an addition to your arsenal.",1452643200,2016-01-13
5.0,"I have recently started using this BB cream and I really like it.  It makes my skin look much better  very even and smooth, plus it feels incredibly light and silky going on. Most impressively, it really blends away your pores somehow.  It only comes in two shades  Fair/Light and Light/Medium.  I bought the Light/Medium although I am pretty fair and it blends in perfectly.

The only drawback is that it does not seem to absorb any oil despite the description and needs to be set with powder.  In fact, Effaclar is La Roche-Posays acne line but this is not at all drying.

This is definitely the best option if you are looking to minimize the appearance of pores (and who isnt?).",1486684800,2017-02-10

5.0,"I was sent this bronzer in Matte Tan and Golden Glow.  I like the Golden Glow a lot better because the color is darker and it shows up better on my skin.  I have a medium skin tone.  Also, this bronzer has a bit of shimmer, like my favorite bronzers do.  It gives the skin a healthy glow without looking like a disco ball.  I have been using this product for a few days, now, brushing it on my forehead, along the hairline area and under the cheekbones to breathe life back into my skin after applying foundation.  The powder is high quality and up to the high standards I have for Lorac products.

I have added a picture showing the color of this bronzer compared to my favorite bronzer, Too Faced Sun Bunny.  As you can see, the color shows up nicely, just like Sun Bunny.  Lorac Bronze Glow is the lighter color, Too Faced Sun Bunny is slightly darker.  Overall, this bronzer is good for women with light skin to medium skin.  I know that the bronzer  looks really shimmery in the swatch, but when you apply it with a brush, it looks a lot more natural.

As for packaging, the bronzer is too bulky.  The package is about double the thickness of the packaging used by other companies, e.g. Too Faced or Mac.  I wish the packaging were slimmer.  The bronzer comes with a brush that is good for contouring, but given the shimmer, this isn't really a bronzer you'd want to contour with.  I think it's a good brush for matte bronzers, but I prefer to use a fluffy brush for this one.  There is also a nice sized mirror at the bottom of the compact.  Just remove the sticker on the bottom to make the mirror usable.  I would have preferred the mirror to have been placed under the cover.",1437004800,2015-07-16

I don't normally worry too much about shampoo/conditioner fragrance, but this stuff is really strong smelling. The conditioner, however, was a bit better than the shampoo.

4.0,"I had to use this tanning mist a couple of times to figure out the best way to use it, it is a little different from what I typically use, a foam from Jergins.  It does spray out a fine mist but it is a pretty wide area and the first time I used it I was in my small bathroom, it got on a few things so the next time I used it, I sprayed it on outside.  Like I said the mist is fine but it does say to use your hand to smooth it in, so you will still have to touch it.  It does have a nice smell going on, not your typical sunless tanning smell, although about 12 hours later I did start to smell that.  The ""tanning"" time to show color is SLOW...so don't think to do this and go somewhere and look tan.  I think it was about 12 hours also to full color time. The color was a nice tan color and it faded slowly also, which was good.  So with preparation, this would be a good tanning mist to use weekly.  It is a little pricey but it also doesn't take much to put it on your skin, overall I think it is a good product for a sunless tan.",1435536000,2015-06-29

She tried it on a few of her pimples and she said it just dried them out but didn't make them go away - that her acne, she felt, looked worse.

I'm guessing it depends on your skin - my skin tends to be drier anyway, while hers is much more soft and elastic. Maybe it works best on adult skin? I don't know - I just know that I'M happy with it, so it'll definitely be staying in the house!",1512345600,2017-12-04

My skin actually feels good since I've been using it. It feels clean, but not stripped and not dry at all. It does have a scent, but it isn't strong at all and doesnt linger on the skin. I can tell it does help control the oil because usually when I wake up in the morning I can feel that sort of light covering of oil on my forehead especially. I don't have that anymore and I haven't experienced it randomly throughout the day like I used to, either.

5.0,"I wear cologne pretty much daily, unless I'm bumming around the house in a t-shirt.  My usual favorite brands are Armani for men, Escada, and Marc Jacobs.  I've not tried or smelled Burberry before.

I enjoy the scent of this product a lot.  It's light and fresh.  Masculine without being overpowering or overly musky.  Seems to have citrus and sandalwood undertones.  I think it's the sort of cologne that makes a nice impression.

As a man, nothing is more of a buzzkill than meeting a pretty lady who is wearing horrible perfume.  I once had a date with an attractive blonde who's eau de toilette actually smelled like a dirty toilet!  Well, more like Black Flag bug spray actually.  But I'd guess that an overpowering or nasty cologne can also kill it for a guy too.

That shouldn't be an issue with Burberry for Men.  I like it a lot.",1407369600,2014-08-07
3.0,"I'm not sure I like the taste of this toothpaste.  It has a strange aftertaste that puts me off.  It tastes great at first but the longer I brush, the less I like this strange taste.  I wasn't sure what jasmine, which is a flower, would taste like but I knew that there is such a thing as jasmine tea and that it's quite popular.  Most conventional toothpastes are too strong for me.  And I'm not really a fan of strong mint.  But I'm not sure I like the flowery taste of this Marvis flavor.  I tried the Ginger Mint flavor but it's way too strong and makes my eyes water.  I don't think there's such a thing as unflavored toothpaste but I'm going to search for it anyway.  I would rather have something fruity, like orange.  Tom's used to make an orange flavor that was available at the drugstore but I haven't seen it around for years.  That one was great for me because it didn't have much mint.  I will use this Marvis Jasmine toothpaste up because it was so expensive, however, I will continue to look for something without mint and something that doesn't taste like a mouthful of flowers.  I find the jasmine taste very unpleasant and absolutely dread using it.  But for the price, I will have to bite the bullet and suck it up like a big girl and manage to use the full tube, even if it takes me a while.  I don't put much on the brush because I'm not a fan of the taste.  If I get a cavity, it's solely the fault of this strange tasting toothpaste.  I guess if you like jasmine tea, you might like this flavor.  But the attraction of flowery toothpaste is totally lost on me.  In a word: Yuck!",1475107200,2016-09-29

4.0,"This bronzer has a silky feel and is pigmented, as I've come to expect from the Lorac brand. The powder is finely milled and does not feel dry to the touch.  The color is not too orange, but is quite light compared to other bronzers in my collection.  Also, while the bronzer is supposed to be matte, there is a slight sheen to it.  I'd call it more of a satin look rather than a true matte.  Personally I prefer the slight sheen because it looks more natural than a true matte. I have a medium skin tone and I am currently tan.  I am wearing Makeup Forever Mat Velvet + Foundation in #53 (perfect match) at the moment.  The bronzer doesn't really show up on my skin very well.  I can use it to slightly warm up my face, but it is not usable as a contour.

I have attached a picture of the bronzer swatched on the underside of my arm in comparison with two other bronzers in my collection.

Left: Too Faced Chocolate Soleil (Matte)
Middle: Lorac Tantalizer Baked Bronzer in Matte Tan
Right: Mac Refined Golden Bronzer (has some glitter particles)

As you can see,the bronzer is lighter than both of those.  Also you can pick up the slight sheen.  I didn't photograph it, but it is also significantly lighter than Too Faced Sun Bunny bronzer.  I will update this when I have a chance to compare to a few other popular bronzers.  I really can't comment on lasting power.  It doesn't really show up on my skin, beyond a slight warming effect.  That said, I got compliments on my nice tan when I wore it, so while I can't use it for contouring, the subtle effect is noticeable to others. :)

The packaging is very bulky.  The top is see through and it slides to the side to allow access to the bronzer.  Underneath, there is a compartment with a brush.  The brush is flat and good quality.  It is really good for applying the powder for contouring purposes.  I think you would still want a fluffy brush to blend if you are fair, but I think the brush is good for application.  In fact, I am taking it out of the compact to use with bronzers that are better suited to my skin tone for contouring.  There is a nice mirror at the bottom, although I don't love having to constantly flip between the bottom and the top to apply the bronzer while also using the mirror.

4.0,"When it comes to bliss products, I'm on the fence. Some of them, like their face and body washes, are really nice. Others, like their toning and cellulite creams are gimmicky. And still others like their body lotions and face creams/lotions are hit and miss. I do love the bliss Soapy Suds and Body Butter (in grapefruit) and their Aloe Leaf + Peppermint Foot Patrol (unbelievable after a long day on your feet!!!), so I thought I would give this a try. I do have sensitive skin, and I have had some reactions to bliss products in the past, but I suppose it's due to each formulation. I always do a patch test first to see if things will go south or not. The patch test I did with this did okay, so I liberally applied this to my neck, chest, and the 'girls' as the directions tell you to.

The lotion itself is a pretty shade of light pink and it feels soooo silky smooth going on. There is a fragrance, but it is very, very light and pretty pleasant. You can definitely wear this with perfume and not have it overpower that scent. When applied it absorbs pretty quickly and doesn't leave behind a greasy feel. It also doesn't develop a sticky texture as you are applying it, like some lotions do. I'm not sure if that's from the water content in them being absorbed faster than the rest of the ingredients, but I was happy that this lotion didn't do that. I've been using this for a little over a week and am about 1/4 of the way through the jar. I'm bummed that it goes so quickly, as this lotion is pricey. It moisturizes quite well, but $45 is still a steep price to pay. This is one of those times when the product actually FEELS as expensive as it is.  One thing to watch out for - if you happen to apply this and not wash your hands afterwards, the taste of the lotion can transfer to food even if your hands are dry. I applied and went for an apple about 20 minutes later, and my first bite tasted like this lotion. Yuck. I had to brush my teeth and tongue to get the taste to go away.

As an aside, this would make a great lotion to use when doing monthly SBEs. Because it is so silky and absorbs evenly, it allows your fingers to evenly move across your skin without tugging or sticking, which is important when performing these exams. Using a good lotion is a trick my ob/gyn suggested because it makes these exams easier, and it also keeps that delicate skin moisturized, which is also important. Some cancer causes the skin to dimple, flake, itch, crack, or turn red and these are also things that can happen with dry skin. So it's VERY important to keep your chest and breast skin properly cared for.",1463356800,2016-05-16

The dark spots and patches on our skin seemed to vanish after a short daily application.

4.0,"This is the 2nd room spray that I purchased in the last week, only because the first one was defective. This time I bought the Antica rose, orris, and oud which works well and smells very nice - it's a warm floral and not too sweet. Also it isn't overpowering or strong and I would like it even more if it lasted longer than it does. I do spray it more than I should just to be able to smell it in the rooms and hallways - for this reason this bottle won't last long for me. It says that it can be used for linens but I am reluctant to spray it on my sheets for fear it might get them stained from the ingredients like any other room spray. There are many different fragrances Antica has to choose from depending on preference and at this price I would recommend giving it a try. The first one I ordered was the lavender and lime and because it didn't work properly I didn't comment on it favorably - I did say it smelled nice though! I have one last remark about this spray - when I press the top down to spray not a lot goes into the air and I have to do it quite a few times to get enough into the room unlike some other ones that I've used (Diptyque which costs more than double the price of these).",1492992000,2017-04-24

A strength of this Pigmentclair is that it goes on very thin and light, almost like a serum.  It also doesn't irritate or burn my sensitive skin immediate upon application, as some products do.  It does, however, begin to dry out my skin as the day goes on.

I always check beauty products on the Paula's Choice website, and, while she doesn't review this exact product, she does review its predecessor, which has almost the exact same ingredients.  Here are her comments about it:  ""That's because it contains a high amount of the B vitamin niacinamide, which research has shown can improve excess melanin (skin pigment) production, lessening and potentially eliminating dark spots. The issue is that for many, treating dark spots takes more than one ingredient. To that end, La Roche Posay included phenethyl resorcinol, an ingredient that has some research showing it can help lighten dark spots! That's exciting, but we're skeptical the amount this serum contains is enough to kick in that benefit.  Even if you wanted to bank on the niacinamide alone, we wouldn't advise it due to the amount of alcohol this fragranced serum contains. It's the fourth ingredient, and in this position is likely to cause some amount of irritation that no one's skin needs.""  In this version, alcohol is actually the third ingredient, so its potential to irritate is even higher.  It's no wonder that some reviewers have experienced dry skin.

5.0,"10 stars!

This Eau de Toilette is just lovely! The manufacturer says Nantucket has wild briar roses and ambergris with notes of citrusy bergamot, vanilla and earthy patchouli.  What I smell on me is a powdery, and somewhat musky floral, which is nice, because I think that is a not-too-sweet and clean scent.  The patchouli and vanilla give this a very erotic scent.  I love a bit of spiciness that you would get from Pachouli, , but I do not smell that -- I smell exotic powder.  Interesting how a blend of scents add up to a clean scent.

It is long-lasting, because I could smell it on me today from yesterday. I just spray a bit and it is enough.  A half a spray. I love how it is subtle.

It comes in a decorator gift box with a baby blue ribbon handle and baby blue tissue inside -- which means it is a perfect gift!

5.0,"This is a wonderful, thick balm cream that provides excellent soothing on shaved skin. It is designed to be used after shaving and its perfect for that. But it can be used in other ways as well. Ive been taping my ankle lately due to a slight sprain and the sports tape  irritated my skin after 8 to 12 hours. So, I applied a little of this balm cream to the area just before putting on the tape and easily went 18 hours without the slightest irritation. Its clearly evident that the soothing ingredients truly work.

The balm cream also has a light, clean, bright scent that disappears almost immediately. Its not overwhelmingly masculine, so could even be considered unisex.

The ingredients are: AQUA / WATER - DIMETHICONE - GLYCERIN - ZEA MAYS STARCH / CORN STARCH - ISOHEXADECANE - SORBITAN STEARATE - C13-14 ISOPARAFFIN - 2,6-DIMETHYL-7-OCTEN-2-OL - STEARYL ALCOHOL - AMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE - POLOXAMER 338 - DISODIUM EDTA - SUCROSE COCOATE - CAPRYLYL GLYCOL - HYDROXYAPATITE - LAURETH-7 - EPERUA FALCATA BARK EXTRACT - DEXTRIN - LACTIC ACID  POLYACRYLAMIDE.

If I understand correctly, its the EPERUA FALCATA BARK EXTRACT (the fourth ingredient from the last) that has the most significant soothing properties. And Im not the only one to notice this. According to a rosacea support group, Eperua falcata bark extract: Rich in flavonoids, this natural active reduces skin hyper-reactivity and protects against inflammation. I couldn't find a lot of scientific studies, but this soothing after shave balm cream really soothes.",1494633600,2017-05-13

4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

* Have a reliable thermostat which apparently is essential, who knew?

* Solid Warrantee

* Comfortable grip

5.0,"La Roche-Posay's eye makeup remover works fantastically well.  I've used other products that do a good job removing eyeliner and eye shadow, but require some scrubbing to get all the mascara off (and I don't even wear waterproof mascara).  This stuff removes even mascara!

There's no detectable odor and the product doesn't burn or sting.  The first time I used, it oversaturated a cotton ball and got some of this stuff in one of my eyes.  It produced a slight sting, nothing extreme.  Since then, I've been more moderate in the amount I use and have no irritation.  The skin around my eyes feels soft and clean, not dried out or oily.  There doesn't seem to be any residue left from this makeup remover.

You have to shake the bottle to combine two distinct layers of solution and they do separate again almost immediately.  I remove the lid, place a cotton ball over the open top, shake, and immediately squeeze some onto the cotton ball.  By the time I set the bottle down, the layers are pretty much separated again, it's that quick.

Definitely recommend.

Update:  I had to stop using this product.  I began to get painful styes on my eyelids.  As soon as one stye would go away, another would appear.  I've never had this issue in my life, and the only thing I could think of was that the oily nature of this remover was causing the blockages leading to styes.  Even though I always followed up use of this product with a good face washing, I suspect the eye makeup remover was the cause of the styes.  I stopped using this several months ago and haven't had a stye since.  It doesn't seem like this is an issue for anyone else in reading the reviews, so I am not changing my rating -- just sharing the experience I had when using this product.",1488412800,2017-03-02

1.0,"I was a little nervous about using this on my face, so I prepared myself by watching the instructional DVD twice and reading all of the enclosed material. The DVD is very reassuring, and very misleading. They make it sound like you just need a little practice at the lowest setting and all will be well. Not true.

Right out of the box, my unit functioned poorly with the fine tip attached. I started trying to use it on my forehead just like on the DVD. They must have turned the unit off for those DVD demonstrations. You cannot slide the tip smoothly across your face like that. If you have adequate suction, as soon as you start to move across your skin, the tip pops off your face. With my unit, suction was sporadic and mostly nonexistent with the fine tip attached.

I switched to the precision tip, which gave me more reliable suction, but I still couldn't use it as instructed, because it HURTS. I was not pressing hard, but it was like pushing sandpaper tightly against your face and then dragging it across the skin. I don't have particularly sensitive skin, but this was so harsh that I decided to check some reviews before possibly damaging my skin. I'm glad I did. I won't be using this unit on my face again. One reviewer mentioned that people have been injured by this product, and she herself was under a doctor's care to heal the damage it did to her skin.

On the DVD they say your face will have some redness for about 30 minutes after a treatment. Once again, untrue. Many hours after use, there were still red patches on my face, and my forehead and nose had a burning sensation.

I thought maybe I could at least get some benefit from the machine by using it on the dry and calloused places on my feet. For that I used the coarse tip and a higher suction level. It was a complete waste of time. The only place you can get suction is on the bottoms of your feet. No edges or contours, because you have to the the entire tip flat against your skin to get suction. I have big calluses on the outer edges of my big toes, and there was no way I could get the tip flat enough to get any suction in that area.

I cannot recommend this product, and I suggest you read a large number of reviews carefully before making your purchase decision. I'll stick with more gentle forms of exfoliation, and accept my fate of being old and ugly.",1352851200,2012-11-14

It covers in one try if you apply correctly -- dot on and pat with a fingertip, blending -- and you have the correct shade. It is absolutely critical to get the right hue. Order a sample pack if you've never used Dermablend before because you can't rely on what your screen shows you. You can apply it over foundation or under it -- either works.

5.0,"I started using Proraso Shaving Cream about two years ago after I stopped shaving with disposable cartridge systems. I used my departure from Gillete to kick my traditional Edge Shaving Gel to the curb and instead picked up Proraso based on the positive reviews here.

Two years later I'm glad to say that I'm still as happy as ever with Proraso. I'm using Proraso with a badger hair brush, a Merkur razor and Sharp razor blades. My resulting shave is ridiculously smooth and pleasantly devoid of irritation that I experiened with Gillete blades. Much of that has to do with Proraso's cream which forms a thick foam with a small dime-sized dollop of cream. The menthol and eucalyptus formula leaves a fresh, tingling feeling when applied and continues post shave.

Best of all one 5.2 ounce tube of Proraso can last close to a year with regular shaving. The initial cost per tube is higher than typical brands but the cost is easily made up over the course of a year.",1292457600,2010-12-16

4.0,"As compared to Cool Water, (the role model for most male fresh aquatics) I found Eternity Aqua (hereafter EA) to be more interesting and less artificially pungent. EA begins with a great cucumber lotus accord that smells pretty unique, but sadly these notes are gone in less than 15 minutes. One is left with the all too common aquatic drydown of calone and cedar, with hints of lavender. Still, the calone (artificial melon) notes are underplayed here versus Cool Water or Nautica Voyage, and so this fragrance was less unpleasant for the intermediate term. (Both Voyage and Cool Water make me want to wash them off after about an hour or so, but EA was less annoying by far.)

Biggest problem with EA is longevity and projection. The longevity issue is a common one with male aquatics, and EA is very representative of that deficiency. The whole show is over in less than four hours, and the fragrance is close to being a skin scent in less than two hours. This is basically a cologne lifespan at an EDT price, but this longevity issue is pretty much par the course for this school of fragrances. If you want a long lasting aquatic, try Bulgari's ""Aqua"", but that is a darker more complex scent that is not as ""fresh"" as EA or its comparable short lifespan brethren.

The projection is also quite weak, which makes this good for the workplace, bad for clubs and other social settings where one might want to be smelled. Both Cool Water and Voyage project better, so if you want to reach out and touch someone's scent receptors from more than an arm's length away, EA is not the best choice.

This to me is between three and four stars. The sweeter opening and somewhat less artificial drydown are pluses compared to other fresh aquatics, and I like the cucumber and lotus notes, but they are all too brief. The fragrance as a whole could last longer, and the quickly departing top notes only add to the disappointment. If you like aquatics and want something a bit less strident, this is a good choice. I'm rounding up to four stars because I'm a sucker for cucumber smells.

Of course, I would also suggest not wearing aquatics at all. These are mainly weak, dull, and simple scents. I suggest trying something with more oomph and interest, like Dior Homme, Aramis 900, or Polo, but then of course you won't smell like every other male aged 16-30 out there. Whether that is a good or bad thing, I will leave up to you to decide!",1431561600,2015-05-14

5.0,"I've never used a cream blush and usually wear very little, if any, make-up.  I decided to give this product a try though and am happy with the results.  My first try, I ended up putting way too much on and it looked like I had gotten a sun burn.  The next try, I used a just a small dab and it worked much better, giving me a little color without making me look sun burnt.  I like that the application is easy.  I can't use powder based make up because they typically contain corn products and I'm allergic to corn, so breathing in the little corn dust in powders is not good for me.  I don't know if this product is comprised of corn, but since I can't breathe it in, I don't get sick from using it.

I did a little research on the Jane Iredale company and was happy to learn that they are cruelty free and don't allow their products to be sold in China.  Any company that sells make up or food products in China is required to either test their products on animals themselves or pay for a Chinese company to do the testing.

It absorbed quickly and left no residue, no stickiness, just smooth skin.  It has a faint rose scent that isn't overpowering. It covers very well with using only a little product, so I'll use less in the future.  Given that, this $31 jar should last months of daily use.

I can't say if it will keep my skin moisturized for 48 hours, as I'll wash well before then. However, it does a nice job on my face, keeping it moisturized, but not sticky and shiny. This is among some of the better moisturizing creams I've used in my regimen.

4.0,"I have a similar spray without any zinc in it that I use for moisturizing my face throughout the day when I'm sitting at my desk, and that spray really helps keep my skin glowing and looking great.

Recently I've had a small issue with minor rashes or possibly tiny acne on my back. I've tried replacing my back brush, bleaching my bras, using Alpha hydroxy acid, and other treatments to no avail. It's not only unsightly but also itchy and uncomfortable, and seems to me to probably be caused by some manner of sensitivity or allergy.

This zinc spray, while it didn't get rid of the rash entirely, dried it up to where each of the little bumps was a lot smaller and it seemed much less inflamed. It dried out my skin quite a bit, probably because zinc is known for killing off the micro biome, so I'm guessing it not only helped kill whatever bacteria was irritating my skin, but also probably some of the good guys that were trying to fight it. However, I will take that deal. This is definitely been the most effective thing I've tried for the rash on my back, and it has gotten to a more manageable level.

If you have persistent acne or another problem that you think is probably caused by skin bacteria, you may find that a zinc spray like this is helpful.",1492646400,2017-04-20
4.0,"So I just started usage of the NuFace system today and will continue to update my review over the next 3 months. Since it takes 60 days to really see results my star usage is purely based off of today's experience. The Trinity was very easy to use out of the box. Make sure you plug the device in well before you wish to start using it. It needs to charge for a while. The directions say 12 hours but mine was fully charged within 8. The easy directions recommend going to NuFaces website and watching their how to videos and I do highly recommend that as well. They are very easy to follow so if you can have it on a phone or tablet play them while using the device the first few times. They have a basic 5 minute option, a more advanced 15 minute technique, and one just for the infrared anti wrinkle head. I did the 5 minute option with a jaw process I saw in the advanced technique video. You are basically pressing or slowly sweeping they device across your cheeks, forehead, and jaw on top of a slippery primer gel.

At first I thought that nothing was happening. Then when I switched to both my jawline and my forehead I could suddenly feel a crackling, electrical sensation! It was not painful at all. I also have a tria hair removal laser and I would say it feels very similar. I don't even think doing all three areas took 5 minutes. I rinsed my face off and applied my usual skincare regimen. I don't know if it's just the primer gel or an affect of the laser but I feel like my skin absorbed my moisturizer better and keep touching my face because it feels so good! I'm sure the primer gel won't last the entire time I'm reviewing this but it's only $12 for 2 ounces on both amazon and sephora, though I have read that some people use aloe instead. I will be back to update!

Update 12/11/15: so I used this just as the directions have instructed and I have mixed feelings on it. Yes, my skin looks better for it! But was it from the actual product or from the daily cleansing and moisturizing regiment that accompanied it? I lean toward the latter. But I did notice a bit of tightening around the jaw. I predominantly used the regular head, not the infrared anti wrinkle head. I didn't see any change in light lines and creases. I am now trying to use the more time consuming infrared head and see if that makes a difference. I will update this again when I can give a definitive answer on that. It is a good prompt,if nothing else, to remind you to care for your skin. But the price tag is still a bit much.",1438128000,2015-07-29

I found the Dermablend Intense Powder to be a good, effective product for touching up skin imperfection areas. While it's also ideal for full face coverage, for me just being able to camouflage areas around the chin and cheeks or wherever I want a bit of coverage is ideal. I find that the trick is to apply with the sponge, then use a medium brush to blend the edges when I use it this way.  I have light/ivory skin, and the color choice works perfectly for me.

5.0,"I was delighted to have the opportunity to test a tube of La-Roche Posay Anthelios Clear Skin Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 60. This is a brand that has impressed me in the past when traveling in Europe, and in need of a good sunscreen. I'm extremely pale, have had several bouts of skin cancer (several kinds), and I have an auto immune disorder that is (in part) triggered by sun exposure, so I have very good reasons to be a sunscreen connoisseur.

The sunscreen is a light cream, with a minimal smell. The cream applies smoothly, quickly drying down to a dry touch. This formulation is water-resistant to 80 minutes, broad-spectrum, oil-free, and won't cause break-outs. No stinging or migration into the eye area.

It doesn't have any oiliness after application, and does such a good job of absorbing oil, that dry areas of my skin continued to feel dry throughout the day - this is a good thing in hot and humid weather, when you need every layer to keep your face from turning into a swamp! The sunscreen is broad spectrum, and contains Avobenzone, which can be extremely important for those who are physically sensitive to the sun; neither zinc, nor titanium dioxide provide the particular protection this ingredient does, though they are more stable.

Outstanding sunscreen ingredients in a luxury skin care base. Highly recommended for normal to oily skin and/or use in hot and humid climates.",1460073600,2016-04-08

Using it s a day cream was not an option, since it does not contain sunscreen.  And using it under my normal day cream, instead of the firming cream, was a flop because it's not a firming cream.

I then moved on to using it as a night cream.  It's smooth and velvety on your skin, and goes on beautifully.  Apparenty, however, it is too rich for my skin because I was soon greeted with a blemish in a spot I'd never had a blemish before.

I would recommend this product to men and women

Pros:
Great price for a night cream (why are women's products so much more expensive??)
Gentle -- not sure of the actual glycolic acid content as it isn't specified, but I used this daily without any redness or irritation
Non-greasy: I didn't experience any break-outs
Fragrance free
Effective: great winter to test out this product, I woke up with noticeably softer and hydrated skin, on nights when I only slept 4-5 hours I would feel a little bit of the cream residue on my face when I washed my face in the morning but it didn't feel thick or greasy at all.
Good amount -- the 4 ounces will last a long time, the thick formulation means you don't have to use much

Cons:
Can't think of any

I noticed another reviewer mentioned using this product around his eyes and the he had good results. I haven't done that because I am hesitant to use any glycolic acid on that very thin sensitive skin underneath my eyes.

5.0,"What an awesome shampoo!  My hair has been abused by repeated coloring and heat styling and this shampoo reverses the damage and leaves it soft, supple and shiny.  I purchased it at Ulta, thinking it would likely work for me because my hair is definitely stressed and it felt dry and brittle.  The directions say to use a quarter size dollop, which was more than enough to work up a frothy cleansing lather on my shoulder length hair.  Some reviewers have complained about the fragrance but I actually like it and it dissipates quickly anyway.  I also use the Strength Cure conditioner (and it only takes a very small amount of this to do the job).  I really like this shampoo and I think it's made a big difference in how my hair looks and feels.  It's sulfate free so it protects my precious hair color and it cleanses well and yet is very gentle to my tired tresses.  I do think that this formula is for rather dry and/or damaged hair (the bottle says ""micro stressed"" whatever that means, lol!) like mine.  I have put my hair through quite a lot lately: regular coloring with a high volume of developer, a color remover and subsequent recoloring with bleach (using Olaplex thank heavens!) and heat styling several times a week. So my hair's not just ""micro stressed"" but is fully stressed!! However, I noticed a difference the first time I used Strength Cure shampoo and conditioner.

4.0,"I have always liked bliss products and generally had good results with them. This one doesn't disappoint neither. This orange-tinted serum is easy to apply, goes on smoothly and dries quickly. It smells pleasant as well. I can't say it has made a difference in the appearance of fine lines or uneven tones. If it has, it would be marginally noticeable. That said, it does leave the skin feeling soft and smooth. The skin also seems to take on a more healthier glow. I usually follow up with a moisturizer to keep it soft and supple. Overall, this skin care product seems to help. I quite like it so far.",1448841600,2015-11-30

She really likes it because it is sweet (but not too sweet like a teenage girl's perfume) and flowery (but not too flowery like perfume for an older woman).  She says it's not overpowering, but is easy to smell (sort of a nice ""light"" scent if that makes sense).  Anyway, she's glad she got it (so am I!) and she recommends it (so do I!).",1423785600,2015-02-13

5.0,"The skin around my eyes has improved in a very short time.  I use dermabrasion for the rest of my face but the eye area is too delicate.
Juice Beauty Green Apple Nutrient Eye Cream is the best product I've used.
 It contains Certified Organic Ingredients including CoQ10, DMAE, peptides, vitamins and antioxidants.
 It does Not contain parabens, proplene, butylene, glycols, petroleum, sulfates, PRGs, TEA, DEA, PHTHALATES, GMO, silicones, pesticides,artificial dyes or fragrances.
 In other words ALL EXCELLENT ingredients NO junk/poison.
The only thing I would change is the amount dispensed by the pump.  It pumps a little too much for just my eye area.  I end up using the excess on the wrinkles of my upper lip.
It's a wonderful product that doesn't clog my pores and plumps the wrinkles around my eye area.

They are more square than most, but it works well for this. My wife loves this and it's great to stash in a purse or travel bag.

4.0,"As usual, my wife is the ""tester"" of these cosmetics. She reports: ""the circles around my eyes are not too dark, so my concern was fine lines, and even before ordering I realized that this is a pigment cream and that I would use it as a day cream not at night.  The shiny pigment is very distinctive and very reflective, and makes skin look more smooth and fresh. This is how it affects how fine lines look and brightens up the skin around the eyes. You can achieve a similar effect with different shimmery powders as you apply make up, but this cream you can wear alone; and I love the flex tip for cream application (see picture). The only thing for me was that the cream washes off too easily. Since we live in a hot, humid climate, and I play tennis and sweat a lot, creams in general melt off my face easily. In one sense it washes off easily, but on the other hand, its not sweat resistant enough. The cream doesn't have any smell and it also did not cause any allergic reaction. The color is pale pink/nude, with a shimmery effect. I plan to keep using it. This is a eye contour idealizer, not a preventive cream, but gives instant help to look more relaxed :) """,1447459200,2015-11-14

1.0,"I am suspicious of this product. I have followed Ayurvedic practices for awhile and central to Ayurveda is determining one's dosha. Is this for pittas? Vadas? Kaphas? Is it tri-doshic? Or, is the manufacturer capitalizing on the popularity of Ayurveda and using conventional perfume making ingredients with a ""natural"" scent? It does not smell natural at all, but like a commercial perfume. A quick look at the Rituals site reveals that the Ayurveda line is only one of six scent lines, all with an Eastern theme. One of the ingredients, cyclohexene, is on OSHA hazard lists. It does contain some natural ingredients, but since Ayurveda is about balancing your energy naturally, why spray yourself with a mist created in a chemist's lab? Be your own advocate and if you're attracted to Ayurveda, don't fall prey to slick marketing tactics supported by pretty prose and photographs. Keep it simple, keep it natural.",1532217600,2018-07-22

5.0,"Blinc Lash Primer should be applied to eyelashes prior to applying Blinc Mascara.  Heck, you could use this product under any mascara--I like that!

I believe Blinc Lash Primer does help nourish my eyelashes.  My eyelashes are definitely longer after I apply this product.  I like that I can apply this product, curl my lashes, and then apply the mascara over eyelashes that have already been elongated by the Primer.  The Primer brush does a great job separating lashes, as well.

I'm applying this Primer after applying my eye cream (I wait a few minutes).  The Primer helps protect my natural eyelashes and helps adhere the Blinc Mascara (again, you could use any mascara with this Primer.  See my review of Blinc Mascara for more information on that great product).

The product goes on ""white"" so you will want to use mascara over it.  I've never worn it alone or longer than a few minutes to see if it stays white.  When I apply my Blinc Mascara over it, I first apply to the white tips of my lashes to ensure I've covered that.  Then I apply to remaining lash area.

What I like is that:
1.  There is no clumping.
2.  Length of lashes is increased easily by applying additional coats.
3.  It doesn't irritate my eyes, skin, or hurt my natural eyelashes.
4.  This really thickens and fills in my eyelashes as a preparatory step before applying my eyebrow mousse.  And covers grey eyelashes really well--yes!!!!!!!!!!!

I have no ""dislikes"" for this product.",1403740800,2014-06-26
4.0,"This is a good collection of skin care products that will appeal to most people.  First of all they come a very nice metal container that can be used to store them and then reused to store many items.  I think that is attractive and helps to make the set even more appealing as a gift.  The design not only looks good, it is a raised print that has texture as well.  I think that before you buy any of the individual items, you should consider buying the whole set and trying each individual product to see which one works best for your skin type.

I love the Vichy Puret&eacute; Thermale Micellar Cleansing Water 3-in-1 One Step Cleanser.  I found that it is a very nice and mild cleanser that I like to use every day.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all and it is good for makeup removal even though I have to use a cloth with it.  It has the consistency of water, so I use it with a microfiber cloth.

The Vichy Double Glow Peel Face Mask is probably my least favorite simply because it isn't a peel mask at all.  I don't know why they advertise it that way because that isn't how it works and that's not even how they tell you to use it.  The instructions tell you to apply, wait five minutes then gently massage to exfoliate, then rinse off.  No peeling at all.  They should change the name of the product.  Also I noticed no glow at all.  I have dry skin and it did nothing.

The Vichy Hydrating Quenching Mineral Face Mask was okay.  I have dry skin and I didn't notice any major hydrating, but my skin didn't feel as dry and it did feel a bit softer.  Since it says that the effect lasts for 24 hours, I plan to try this every day to see if I get a better result.

The Vichy Pore Purifying Clay Face Mask was okay.  It can only be used 1 to 2 times a week and I haven't noticed any negative effects.  It does say not to let it fully dry, but I find that hard since it is supposed to be left on for five minutes.

Overall this is a nice gift set and I think that most people would probably like it.  I would like it a bit better if it included a moisturizer, but I didn't experience any problems with any of the products.",1507766400,2017-10-12
5.0,"I do try alot of facial products but always go back to the Image line. This and their vital c are my favorites. I have been using this for about 4 years when my daughter who  owned her own spa  introduced me to this line. This stuff is great at cell turnover. I  hadn't used this  in a while and when I first put this on I noticed all the dry ,dead skin coming off which is a good thing. It does sting a little at first but that wears off once you have used it for a few days. My complexion looks better than it has in a while and my skin tone is even. I know this is Authentic  because my last jar came from the spa and it's exactly the same. Image also changes their formula now and than which is why some people question the Authenticity  because while alot of people are use to the white cream the newer version is yellowish.

This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.

3.0,"This Dermablend makeup setting kit has some plusses and minuses.  You first apply a concealer and gently blend over your face.  This is not included in the kit so you get to choose one that best matches your skin tone.

Then tap the setting powder into the cap and apply with the powder brush.  The hard part is just using a tiny amount.  If you go heavy handed youll be shining a spotlight on wrinkles and crevices. Then you use the setting spray by spritzing it into the sponge, tapping the damp sponge into the powder in cap and gently dabbing onto covered facial area. After a few minutes brush the area a few times.

The secret handshake to make this product work perfectly (and it can work perfectly) is to use a light hand  and then back off to an even lighter hand.  It may take a few tries but with practice youll get very nice results.

4.0,"L'Occitane's ""Immortelle Divine Cream"" comes packed in a stylish golden jar with 1.7 ounces of product. Initially I did a double take at its price versus quantity but after using this twice daily for a month I estimate that I've used less than 10% of the cream and can totally envision the contents of this pot lasting for a year. All in all, a reasonable price when stretched out for the duration.

The cream itself has a mostly neutral odor with delicate floral notes (likely the Immortelle and Myrtle essential oils) that I personally find to be quite pleasant. The product comes with a small caviar spoon to dig out a small dab - and 2 doses is all you need to cover the entirety of your face. Absorption happens quickly and initially adds a noticeable moisturized sheen that recedes to a more natural, flushed look within 15 minutes. Your skin won't feel greasy, but rather moisturized and conditioned to the touch. The product is non-comedogenic and I can attest that no breakouts or irritations have occurred. I particularly like the overnight results that the cream provides - a healthy radiance and vibrant, tightened tone all around.

Lovely product with good lasting results and elegantly packaged making it a nice gift item to boot.",1404086400,2014-06-30

3.0,"First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

This Eau de Toilette hits a home run on all counts.  It is not sweet.  It does not give me a headache.  It has a pleasant, fresh scent that strikes me as a mix of wood bark and dainty flower.

My husband judges a cologne by how long the fragrance remains detectable for his nose.  I just sneaked in the bedroom and sniffed his wrists without waking him up.  It's there, whisper light and pleasant.  I could sniff on this all night...

2.0,"I was going to use the entire bottle before I posted my review but I'm already having problems so here it is. First thing I noticed was how cheap the packaging is. Normally that doesn't bother me too much since I'd rather be paying for what's in the bottle than what's outside of it but this packaging is a problem. It's supposed to dispense a red liquid and a white liquid in equal amounts when you press down on the pump however after only a couple weeks it only dispenses the red liquid now. I have to try to cover the red hole and push it down again to get any of the white liquid to come out which makes a big mess and usually just gives me twice as much red as white. It's really annoying. I've cleaned out the tube and everything thinking that maybe it was blocked but it's not. I don't know if the pump dispenser inside the white side came loose but it's not like I've been rough on this bottle or anything. It goes in my drawer and out of my drawer and that's it. As for what it's done for my skin, I'm not really sure I see a huge difference. It's nice and I do like the way it feels on my skin but I can't really see any huge benefits, certainly not any that justify the cost and the crummy packaging. Maybe my skin feels a little plumper but I can't really be sure if that's when this product or just my general skin care routine.

4.0,"I'm not one that likes the heavily lined and lashed look so many are doing, and was a little fearful about what I'd look like using this product. As it is, I only apply eyeliner and mascara to my upper lid and lashes. Another fear is that I wear glasses and having a smudge on my lens drives me nuts. Would this cause a problem?

You can put this on as light or as heavy as you want. Just add more strokes for a darker, thicker look. I suppose the more strokes you use, the longer your lashes will be from the fiber build up. Is that really any different than other mascara?  I don't know as I've never used many strokes in the past.

There is absolutely no clumping or flaking and it goes on a great deal smoother than the less expensive stuff I've always used. So I was immediately impressed. When touching the lashes, you definitely feel the fiber that makes them look longer and thicker.

One thing that really stands out is that it stays put. It doesn't say it's waterproof, but there has been no smearing or running from tears when reading a book or when in the rain. Unlike the other product I've used, this mascara does not end up smeared on my lower lid as the day goes on, and I don't believe any smudges on my glasses are a result of using this.  It's not at all difficult to remove when you are ready.

Would I have purchased this at a price so much higher than what I've paid for others? Probably not. I don't believe I've ever spent more than $9 for mascara.  I do like the look, how well it stays on and the fact that it goes on smoother than anything else I've used.  So while I can say that I like it, I'm not sure if I'd be willing to pay $25.

Amended 8/12/14:  I've had the chance to try out another brand of mascara that also promotes longer, thicker lashes by the addition of fibers to your eyelashes.  I do have to say that this mascara does a better job and goes on much smoother.",1396483200,2014-04-03
3.0,"I'm currently pregnant and wanted to try this lotion on myself before baby is born. It is very watery but moisturizes well, a little goes long way. But the scent is overpowering, it is too strong for me, so I'm not going to use on baby. On top of that this scent is kid of aggressive, very flowery. I prefer LaVanila Baby Lotion much better-great ingredients and truly baby smell.",1286323200,2010-10-06
2.0,"I ordered the Crepe Erase Body Cream, which I really like, but the Crepe Erase Facial Scrub just isn't for me. The scrub didn't leave me feeling like my face was fresh and clean. Instead of feeling like I'd just washed my face, it felt as though I'd used something heavy or slightly oily. Also, the micro beads didn't exfoliate as much as they actually left tiny scratches on my face.

I've been exfoliating with St. Ives Peach Facial Scrub since I was in my teens, and I know to scrub very gently.  It might be the difference between St. Ives natural, ground peach pit scrub, and Crepe Erase's plastic micro beads, which I found to be too harsh for my sensitive skin. Also, plastic micro beads aren't biodegradable, which isn't good for our waterways. (Something our older son pointed out to me.)

I've been really happy with the St. Ives facial scrub for many years, and it's what our kids prefer as well, so I'll continue to buy St Ives, even though I did really like the Crepe Erase Body Cream. (Which I'll be reviewing separately.)",1459296000,2016-03-30
3.0,"This review is for the Vichy Quenching Mineral Facial Mask for Dry Skin:

When I purchased this, it's labeled as a Mask, so I thought it was the type that you leave on for 10-15 min & then take off.  So as I was reading the instructions, I was kind of confused as to what it does?

The bottle contains 2.54 oz & the gel is a translucent pale blue. Its a pretty bottle, but the lettering on the back of the bottle is almost impossible to read. The box says to use: apply & let sit for 5 minutes, then massage the excess in. Use 1-3 times a week as needed. Avoid eye & lip areas. Rinse them in case of contact. (It never specifies how long to leave this on or what amount of time works best? Is it apply at night & leave overnight?).

The gel goes on gooey & sticky. It makes your skin appear shiny when its applied. It has a light scent of Jasmine water & bamboo that lingers until you wash it off. The scent is nice, very subtle, & non-flowery. At first use, I tested it on my forehead & a small patch on my hand to make sure there wasn't a reaction. It did not seem to dry all that fast, so I think if you were placing all over your face, then laying down to sleep, it make a slight mess on your pillowcase. In regards to softening dry skin, it seemed to just be more sticky than actually helping the dryness. I only used it a few times because I did not like how sticky it was. I used it at night before bed. Never tried it in the morning before applying makeup.

Likes:
Pleasant Smell
No Parabens

Dislikes:
Sticky

Overall, I gave it 3 stars. While it didn't work for me, someone who like gel type products may enjoy. I did like that it was a pleasant scent & not overpowering.",1477958400,2016-11-01

This product, the HA5 Rejuvenating Hydrator, is designed to moisturize, and smooth away fine lines and wrinkles. It has an interesting texture, as it is a really light serum but still feels like a gel, but it provides so much hydration that your skin feels like you've applied a heavy, silky cream. There is a faint, medicinal, clean scent to it. It arrives protected and presented in a heavy display-type box, and a large, sleek silver dispenser that is a bit deceiving, considering there's only 2oz of product within. The Amazon description recommends to wet your fingers before applying to face and neck (though that is not mentioned on the box or product) twice daily, both in the AM and PM. Application is smooth and not greasy, and only a little bit is needed. I have been using it for about a week, and it does give your skin a beautiful glow, and seems to plump up skin so wrinkles disappear.

I have tried many Vichy facial products and have liked pretty much all of them including this mineral water gel moisturizer. This has a creamy gel feel and goes on moist but quickly absorbs into your skin. It has a pleasant floraly beauty scent to it which I find pleasant.  It leaves your skin dewy without being greasy.

Also buy the NuFace Wrinkle Remover attachment! This attachment is great on age spots. It only fits on this Nu Face Trinity. Have yet to see it available on AMAZON. You need to buy it directly from NuFace

I would also recommend the Suzanne Somers Facemaster to use along with this item. The FaceMaster is great with small wrinkles around eyes and detailed work. You need to use two hands with the Facemaster and I like that the Trinity only requires one hand. That way you are free to multi task! These at home wrinkle and age support products do require use three or more days per week. It's just like working out, you will lose the toning if you don't keep doing it!!

2.0,"I have heard all the hype about the Clarisonic cleansing brushes, but I did not want to shell out $100+ for a tool to wash my face. When I got the opportunity to review this product, which is a less-expensive copycat of the Clarisonic, I decided to give it a try. First of all, be aware that you have to charge this for 24 hours before using. In actuality, the blinking ""charge"" lights went out after about 12 hours, so it was probably fine then but I gave it the full 24 to be fair. It's not intuitive how to connect the charger (it's magnetic), so I had to read the instructions. It's probably a good thing that I read them because there is a warning not to unplug the charger before disconnecting it from the brush, because the battery can discharge and then you would have to start over again. When I finally got to use this product, I was not impressed at all. The brush is very soft (a good thing) but it vibrates (as opposed to spinning) and it just made my head vibrate and feel uncomfortable. It actually felt like a mild electric shock. There is a vibrating timer on the brush that tells you to move to a new area, but based on this timing it would take about 45 minutes to wash my entire face. When I moved the brush to my nose, I felt actual pain (I broke my nose a few years ago and had a surgical repair, but have never felt pain after the initial healing until I used this brush). I tried to give it to my teenage daughter, but she has sensitive, acne-prone skin and didn't want to risk using this product. Maybe I'll use it to clean my shower.",1492732800,2017-04-21

The pro basics shades seemed great, but the pixelated colors all looked a bit too garish in person for my taste.  However, with some blending and using the pixelated color as more of an accent to the pro basics, the overall effect was quite nice.  Ive only been brave enough to try the copper shade of pixelated color, but I think the two shades of gray could also work well.  Im not sure Ill ever be brave enough to try the shades of purple.  Im in forties, so Im fairly certain sparkly purple eye shadow would look ridiculous on me and not at all flattering.

5.0,"As background, I rarely wear perfume, and prefer Bath and Body Works cream instead, but was intrigued by the description of this perfume.  Here's a description of the scent of this Juicy Couture Gold Couture Eau de Parfum according to the manufacturer:

Glamorous, Golden Composition

Viva La Juicy Gold Couture opens with luscious wild berry notes and deepens to a heart of sambac jasmine and honeysuckle. A sensual base of melted caramel, vanilla cream, praline, and sandalwood combine to create a warm finish.

Top: wild berries, gardenia, muguet

Mid: vanilla orchid, honeysuckle, and jasmine sambac

Bottom: sandalwood, melted caramel, vanilla cream, and praline

I really like this perfume, but I don't catch the top notes at all, primarily what I experience is the bottom notes of sandalwood, melted caramel and amber (which is not mentioned).  The scent is pronounced but not overpowering and lasts.  It is a sophisticated scent, not a bright floral or fruit.

5.0,"This is a really large size bottle that will last one for a long time even if used twice daily.  Micellar water is a new way of cleansing, toning and hydrating skin.  It is much better that traditional cleansers.  For one thing, one only needs a cotton pad and a little bit of the water.  Soak in a little bit of solution on the cotton pad and apply directly tot he skin.  Solution will remove the dirt and hydrate the skin.  Definite advantage of the micellar water is that unlike traditional cleansers, this solution does not require rinsing off with water.  As a matter of fact micellar water will not just cleanse but tone and hydrate the skin.  Micellar water has a molecular structure of a water molecule that will pull out the dirt with its tail.  While water is bonding with the skin, oil is pulled out by the surfectant without any irritation.  Even professional estheticians should use this solution in their practice.  It will safe so much money on hot towels, not to mention waste.  This bottle has a convenient pump that make it easy to dispense as much or as little as one wants to use.

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me.

The one negative is the asking price.  This is a very expensive product.  While it moisturizes the lips, I wonder if the asking price is an honest price.",1492560000,2017-04-19

5.0,"Living in a high humid area and because I wear contacts, I consistently fight with my mascara either with raccoon eyes, irritation or clumping. Le Roche-Posay's Waterproof Mascara met my expectations and beyond. It is applied easily without clumping and gives a natural look. I experienced no irritation, no raccoon eyes, and it made my lashes look amazing. I am in love! Its a little pricier than my normal brand, but there is so many wins with this that I really do not care.",1487376000,2017-02-18
4.0,"Since I have extremely sensitive skin and eczema, I can't wear make-up every day... I only wear make-up on special occasions, such as weddings, interviews, photo shoots, etc.

One of my biggest challenge when it comes to wearing foundation is my dry skin flaking and peeling as soon as my liquid foundation dries after application. I am giving this product a four star rating because I still see some dryness on my face, and the coverage is more medium than full, unless I REALLY cover up with layers and layers of foundation (I use the sponge that came with it). Overall, I think it applied better than my other foundations, but not by very much. It is definitely matte - maybe I should look for a more dewy foundation.

The direction says if I want a more dewy look, pat some water on my face with the sponge afterwards. That wasn't very helpful on my face. Once the water dries, it looks dry still. Regardless, it was easy to apply.

About mid-way through the day, I noticed that my face was getting a bit pink - the beginning of irritation. My face was feeling tingly as well, but it wasn't a full-blown irritation. I've skin-tested this a few days before applying on my face, and I was fine, so this could have been the heat of the day or that my face simply doesn't like to be covered in foundation.

Hopefully my before/after photos help you see how it worked on my face. I tried to take it under the same light but I think the before photo still turned out a bit darker. You can use my lips as gauge - I did not put any lipstick on in both photos.",1502496000,2017-08-12
5.0,"Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.",1357689600,2013-01-09
4.0,"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1497830400,2017-06-19
4.0,"As far as primers go, this latest entry into the field from bliss is pretty darn nice. I tend to sweat off my makeup by mid-day thanks to facial hyperhydrosis, so finding a good primer has been a long journey. Some worked but caused major breakouts, some were fantastic with my skin but didn't work more than a few hours. DHC Velvet Coat is a favorite, so is Smashbox Photo Finish. My current primer has been benefit's POREfessional which is not only very skin friendly but last's through even humid, muggy days when it's like stepping into a sauna any time you have to go outside. So I set aside this primer to give the one from bliss a try.

First, this primer is lighter than I expected. If I have any dry spots on my face or get lazy and skip my moisturizer (also with SPF), the POREfessional or Velvet Coat is enough to prevent any problems with that dryness showing up once my makeup is finished. I purposefully skipped moisturizer one day to see how this would perform. Bad decision. This primer is light and thin, like a toning lotion. I'm used to primers that go on a bit thicker and leave your skin feeling velvety smooth and allow foundation to be easily applied. When applying foundation over this bliss primer without using moisturizer first, it took more work to get the foundation evenly blended out. For the other trial days I used moisturizer like normal and while not as smooth a 'canvas' as with the other types of primers, my foundation did apply a good deal smoother and easier.

As for staying power, I'd have to give this about a seven out of 10. Up here in the northeast we had a lovely stretch of humid weather that had everyone feeling soggy within moments of walking outside. Still, this held up pretty well on a few days of running around doing errands, going to appointments and meetings, and walking around during a local town's Second Saturday events. It doesn't stop the shine as well as my other primers do, so I need to blot and powder a couple more times than usual.

Price-wise this primer is cheaper per ounce than Velvet Coat, POREfessional, or Smashbox. I really like that it has SPF in the mix for added sun protection, and that it doesn't bother my skin. I wish it made my skin feel smoother for foundation application, but that's really just personal nitpicking. Though it's not as hardworking has my other heavier primers, I think this one will be excellent for cooler/cold weather when I don't need that heaviness. I like using Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer for that time, but oi, is it ever expensive. Hopefully this bliss primer will turn out to be a great -  and cheaper - alternative.",1469836800,2016-07-30

3.0,"Mrs. Boilermate says:

First impression: highly scented

Second impression: VERY highly scented

This is so scented that I can only use it in very limited amounts.  Just applying this concentrate to one forearm is enough to fill the entire room with the scent. It is not a bad scent, but it is too overpowering for extended use. The scent also lingers for quite a while after the lotion has been applied.

I like how the lotion makes my skin feel smooth and supple, but I can only tolerate the scent in small doses.

At this rate, the jar will last me years.

On a positive note, this concentrate is excellent when used on small patches of tight, dry skin that are healing from a close encounter with the edge of a hot turkey roasting pan.",1420502400,2015-01-06

I have very sensitive skin that's easily irritated by almost everything, and this cleanser so far has been awesome.
No irritation and the splotches and minor blemishes are clearing up by the day. I do follow it with the Cucumber Lotion and then a moisturizer. Badescu products are very reasonable in price, and do what they promise.
I got the smaller sizes to see what works with my particular skin and will get the larger sizes when the ones I decide to stick with run out.
I've found the rose hip nourishing oil does redden my face right after use, but it does go away and the moisturizer with the spf stings a bit but it's getting better the more I use it and my skin clears.",1362009600,2013-02-28
3.0,"I am going to say it is an okay product. I did not see any changes in my skin as far as my pores. They want you to do an 8 day challenge, but i just don't think that is enough time to notice a change. I've been using this for 10 days. I will continue to use it to see if I notice it getting better.
What I can tell you is
Positives: The pump..i love products that come with a pump so that I don't have to stick my fingers into the jar.
  The texture..it is a light creamy texture not greasy or sticky
  The scent.. it smells a little rosey, but is not overwhelming which is always a positive for me since I have allergies.
  The look... the color is pearlescent and while others do not seem to notice it, I can see it on my darker skin
  also a little goes a long way
Negative:  It bothers me that there weren't any directions in the package, but i went online to look up how to use it.
  On one occasion it burned a little, but I can't remember what I had done as far as washing my face etc.
  sometimes it peels

I have worn it on my face alone and it feels as if it is tightening the skin, I am going to try wearing it underneath my makeup to see
how it reacts to that. other than that if it really does what it says, I don't see a problem with the price.",1446422400,2015-11-02
5.0,"First of all, this is a Vines review for PHYTO Mix and Mask Hair Trio. The Vines system is directing me to this product site and I cannot change it. I just want to say that I've used this hair system for a week now. My spouse declined to test it since she is very particular about what she uses on her hair. So, I am a guy and have a full head of gray/silver hair that is starting to thin. My hair is also somewhat dry during the cooler weather months. So I thought I would give it a try. I know these aren't cheap products, but I must say, my hair has never felt or looked better! I use the masks very sparingly after shampooing. I actually towel dry my hair, apply a combination of the 3 masks (you can determine what works best for you based on your specific hair conditions). I wait 5 minutes, then rinse. After a quick blow dry, I can literally feel and see a difference in my hair. It is fuller, shiny (or should I say lustrous?) and very soft. My spouse has remarked how much better it looks. And brushing is all I need to get it into a nice style for the day. I can honestly say that if you have dry, damaged hair, these masks can provide a solution that is gentle, and doesn't contain a lot of chemicals. The performance of my usual hair shampoo/conditioner pales in comparison.",1510876800,2017-11-17

5.0,"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

5.0,"Full disclosure: I've been using Vichy a long time. Long before I was able to get this Vine sample.  I've always liked their brand.  Several reasons, one of which is that they are honest with packaging. The bottle you see is the size you get. No false bottoms that fill up half the bottle so you get less.  No big boxes containing a tiny product inside.  So many luxe brands do that.  You reach the bottom of the pot and it looks like it could still hold another ounce.  That's a big deal to me: Vichy shows you what you get.

The other thing is I have sensitive skin AND eyes. Before bed, some products end up rolling on to my pillow and later into my eyes.  The pain is excruciating.  Vichy never makes my rosacea act up or feels sensitive in any way, even if I have a blemish or a rash.  It's soft and soothing. Plus, I can tell it works because in the morning, when I wash my face lightly, I can still feel it on my skin.

With this bottle, they are promoting a new plumping feature.  I wish plumping was fashionable on my hips. Sadly, no. But it does help with wrinkles and I'm pleased with the look around my nose and crow's feet which look more like crow's footprints on the sand when I use this.

It has spice and wood overtones at first but these soon deepen into a cinnamon/musk/cedar aroma that is very appealing. The aroma lingers for quite some time without losing much of its early intensity. I also found this after shave spray exceptionally bracing and soothing on the skin, something that is often overlooked in discussing the merits of high quality after shaves.

Sometimes it makes my forehead dry if I scrub too much so be careful. If you're looking to prevent zits- I've found stress and diet (no greasy/oily/sugary foods or dairy products!) have more of an effect than face wash in my case. Just try eating healthy/clean for a week or 2 and you'll notice clearer skin!

SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O.

I LOVE the corrective care pot of cream.  It is superb.  I also love the body lotion.  Great products, gentle and softly scented.  Wonderful!  I am not a huge fan of micellar cleanser in general, so I could take or leave that.  Also, the serum is redundant, you can use it under the cream, or by itself.

He's also a fan of the moisturizer because it doesn't irritate is sensitive skin and it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. He doesn't use the toner. For some reason it's the one step I just can't get him to do, but I do use it and I love it. I'm 39 years old with very sensitive skin and monthly hormonal breakouts.

I have purchased other high-end foundations that come in a pump bottle that gave me way more product than I wanted. I always feel like I am wasting money when I don't use all the make-up being pumped out. The tip design on this is easier to control and made so that you get out only what you need and want. The make-up itself is more of a cream. It has the feel of medium weight foundation, but the coverage is amazing. I am older and have inherited the family trait of dark circles under my eyes that seem particularly bad in the mornings. I also have a few minor sun spots and this make-up did a great job of smoothing out the skin tones without looking thick and heavy. It has a broad spectrum sunscreen of SPF 25. It has more of a matt finish so that you notice other parts of my face like eyes and lips, and not my foundation.",1500076800,2017-07-15

5.0,"The key here is blending. It is crucial to this product looking natural. Therefore, even if you get your absolute closest color-match (find your perfect shade in the mall but buy it here!), you will still need to seriously blend this since it is for a small concentrated area. So apply this sparingly (you can even use a small brush instead of indiscriminately applying from the tube). Once you have the area properly concealed, grab your Beauty Blender and feather out those edges especially ... blend, blend, blend. If you need to add a bit more, use a brush to touch up just those areas and blend again.

Do use a powder to set this. (I used Laura Mercer since it is translucent and amazing). Not only will it help prevent color-transfer, but it will provide a more natural appearance. (But, do be careful ... this will still transfer to clothing if one isn't very careful).  To the best of my knowledge, this is one of the best products you can buy to conceal blemishes, tattoos, bruises, etc.

It's not absolutely perfect, but in the right hands (careful and patient hands), it can definitely conceal whatever you need concealed. Give it a try!  Highly recommended!",1500854400,2017-07-24
5.0,"After use for about a week, my husband and I have loved Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Mask. It feels good on the face, and we both really liked how the mask doesn't dry out the face but stays moist. It immediately brought quite a bit to the surface and left our pores cleaner. We both have noted fewer zits and blemishes since we started using it. What more could you ask?

Also, my husband has an autoimmune disorder that often manifests as rashes and swelling on the face. This seemed to help quite a bit. Perhaps due to the advertised antiinflammatory zinc dioxide. It makes sense that this would work to fix blemishes as it decreases inflammation (which can cause blemishes) and kills bacteria as it exfoliates and moisturizes.

We will likely be purchasing more when we run out.",1415145600,2014-11-05

3.0,"I was excited when I had the chance to review this.  Being a graduate student, dark circles under the eyes are sometimes a frequent visitor, and this would have come in handy.  When I received the product I tried it immediately.  Sadly, it did not cover the circles without assistance.  I used a pure yellow cover up stick over them and then retried it.  Success!  However, for the cost it should have worked better, I think. There The average non-dark-circle-blemishes were adequately covered up more or less.  I did like the feel of the makeup on my skin, but coverage wise was a big ehhh for me, in general.  I'm not sure that the extra price over drugstore brands is worth it - at least for me.",1408060800,2014-08-15
4.0,"This eau de parfum has a very light fragrance. It is reminiscent of flowery cotton, but it is so light that after a couple hours when I held my wrist up to my friend to ask if she could smell it she could not. This is wonderful for those who are sensitive and hate those elevator chocker scents.

It comes in a handsome spray bottle. The lotion that comes in the package also has this light scent but the lotion itself is very runny. I would use it for the scent to rub on my skin, but as for it to be used as an effective lotion for skin softening/ body lotion for example it would have to have a creamier/thicker base.
The box makes a nice gift set and for those who like light fragrances this would be a good choice.",1422921600,2015-02-03

5.0,"I'm seriously getting sold on Demablend! I've been using four products the last month and have been really happy with them. This is no different. I've used ""green"" cover up makeup before for a few imperfections. I have found that sometimes they are too chalky and do not blend well, and the other one ""disappeared"" once my liquid makeup was applied. It didn't happen with this! I applied both with fingertips and with a sponge, both worked great! I followed up with Dermablend liquid makeup and loved it. The green covers pimples, red splotches, and red discoloration. This makeup is not thick, and applies easily. The tube is small, but you only need a small amount. I did not experience any rash or irritation. It takes a few applications to get used to applying green makeup before your regular makeup but it works wonders!",1498435200,2017-06-26
5.0,"Based on reading another review, I went to Mario Badescue's website and did their skin analysis.  You answer some questions and they give you product recommendations.  I had already received this moisturizer for review, but had not tried it yet.  This moisturizer was not the one recommended so I was a little nervous at the term ""moisture magnet.""  I have combination skin and have a hard time finding moisturizers that don't make me breakout. Even if I find one that works for a while eventually it makes my skin breakout.  I usually don't use a moisturizer just to avoid the drama.

The first time I tried it, I put it on my arms.  It has a slight pleasant scent to it.  I just use a little dab ( see picture) and it goes a long way.  My dog came over to me and tried to lick my arms lol so I guess it's a good scent to him too lol.  The scent dissipates after a momment. When my skin stayed normal the next day, I tried it on my face before I went to bed.  I woke up the next morning, and no new breakouts!  I already had 2 breakouts from getting my face waxed ( I went to a new salon and something they used on my face after waxing to calm the redness made me breakout). Both the breakouts were visibly reduced.  My skin feels soft. My forehead was a little shiny the first day so I've decided to use the moisturizer once a day for now to see how my skin reacts.  As this product has sod in it I decided to use during the day.  So far so good once a day use.

I recommend using the skin analysis. I am going to receive free samples from Mario Badescue's  website of the products they recommend for my skin, so I can test out the moisturizer they recommend in comparison to this one I received to see which is the best for my skin.  Either way I am sticking with a moisturizer from their line.  The cool thing is they don't have a one size fits all moisturizer like most companies, so you have freedom to choose which one works best for you. This is my first experience with the company, and it was a good one. I recommend trying their products.

UPDATE: This moisturizer still works great after using a few weeks.  I've also noticed a decrease in the fine lines that were starting to form on my face without using my normal age defying product of which I had run out recently.  I guess my skin was drier than I thought before using this product, and maybe that was what was causing the lines.  I'm happy to be saving money by only needing one product.  I will definitely buy in the future.

UPDATE 2:  I bought a new bottle and continue to be happy with the product months later.",1472688000,2016-09-01
3.0,Don't like the fact that I had to put 3 coats. I wish gel polish was darker like one coat nail polish.,1362873600,2013-03-10
5.0,"I like this moisturizer. It's lightweight, absorbs fast and smells nice. I thought the lightening agent would be retinol or one of the popular acids, mandelic, glycolic etc but it is actually derivative of salicylic acid- beta-lipohydroxy acid.
The LHA is more for acne- ''According to a 2007 study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, LHA works in a similar fashion to salicylic acid. Specifically, LHA decreases the concentration of bacteria found within the pore. LHA has a lipophilic (fat-loving) nature and relatively slow penetration in the skin, which together make it an effective exfoliant, even at low concentrations. The LHA molecule has been found to separate transmembrane glycoproteins at the corneosome/corneocyte interface, cleanly detaching individual corneosomes from one another (European Journal of Dermatology, 2002). Studies have also shown that LHA appears to have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal and anticomedogenic properties, combating acne and even dandruff.''

Because I already use pretty good skincare items to keep my melasma at bay, I use Vichy gel more of a acne control. Although I'm almost 40 I still have a problems with occasional pimples. This cream made a nice difference and I can honestly say that my skin is clearer. I use it everyday and I don't experience any dryness or redness.

The most effective and fast in getting rid of dark spots were Obagi tretinoin, hydroquinone and TCA acid. After I made my skin even I use night retinol cream at night, vitamin C serum during the day and once a week mandelic, lactic or light TCA peel. My skin looks pretty good. After the summer I saw 1 dark spot on my cheek and I just burn it out with TCA peel.
I use at least SPF30 everyday and during the summer I reapply sunscreen every time I'm going outside or every 1-2 hours if outside, wear hat most of the time.
I have to say that once someone develops melasma it will stay forever, you can only maintain the results. One day without protection in the sun can ruin months of treatments.

Melasma is different than sun spots (age spots, liver spots). Melasma is hormonal induced and sun spots are from sun exposure. Melasma looks like splash of the paint or shadow and sun spots are more even and superficial. Melasma can not be treated with IPL lasre (heat) and sun spots can. The best is go to a doctor and google a little bit.

I hope this will help a bit.",1446508800,2015-11-03

3.0,This is not my favorite eyebrow pencil because it does not go on as smooth as it should.  I also prefer the twist-up style rather than sharpening with a pencil sharpener.  The spoolie brush is very good & helps to smooth out the waxy/bumpy pencil marks.  The brush also works really well on eyelashes.

5.0,"There is only one other face cream that I have ever tried that you could actually see results the first time I used it, and I have used a ton over the years. This Vichy gives results right away as well. I love that it is so light weight. There is no greasiness at all and it leaves no shine on your skin. My face looks and feels so smooth and hydrated. There is only very slight scent, so it shouldn't bother sensitive individuals. Lines and wrinkles look smoother, or plumped out and skin just looks youthful. It feels like a rich, thick cream, but as soon as you rub it in, it absorbs immediately, like a serum would. Very interesting and skin just looks so fresh and young... no other way to describe it. This one is a keeper and the price is very competitve.",1445126400,2015-10-18
4.0,"Earlier this month I turned 35 and I swear it was no big deal. But ya know what sucks? Being 35 and having BOTH wrinkles and acne. Seriously!?! I am so over it.

When the chance came along to give the bliss Multi-'Face'-eted All-In-One Anti-Aging Clay Mask a whirl I figured at worst my sensitive and reactive skin would protest, I'd have a major break-out and I'd get to complain about this pricey product's uselessness. I hate to be wrong but this is one instance where I was very, very wrong. Not only did my skin not go all reactive like it has with pretty much every mask product I've ever used it helped heal the start of a hormonal acne flare-up without it actually surfacing. That doesn't happen to my face. Ever. The next morning after the first time I used it I noted that my complexion was glowing, like it used to when I was pregnant, so in a totally good way. Each subsequent use I've had the same results, any acne trying to ruin my week has had considerably less healing time and hasn't hurt as bad as usual and the day after my skin is radiant.

So why the 4 stars? First of all, when you read the fine print it warns that this can stain light colored fabrics. But it doesn't warn you that it can also stain your skin if you're very fair skinned like I am. No matter how much I scrub it I have a blue tint to my skin for a few hours afterward. :S Yikes! Secondly, I agree with another reviewer in regards to the microbeads, they're completely unneeded in this mask and I have been trying to avoid buying products with them because of their environmental impact.

Overall, I like it well enough that I would recommend it, especially to those who have the same wrinkles and acne issues I'm fighting.",1416960000,2014-11-26
3.0,"I love the pure white look of this candle and the simple branding that doesn't overwhelm. The fragrance is nice; not overly powerful, but noticeable, but is a little too patchouli and oak-based for me to love it. I tend to enjoy more fruity and dessert-based candles, which is probably why this one wasn't my thing.

Of course, this is pretty pricey for a candle, too, though you can definitely also consider it a little piece of decor (which you can't say about every candle and every brand). It would look great in a bachelor pad, too!",1392076800,2014-02-11

4.0,"I am very torn in my review about this product.  One the one hand, I can't find any scientific literature that microcurrent facials actually work.  On the other, the product is well made and delivers an electrical current like the manufacturer claims.

To start, this product is very easy to use.  The conductive gel goes on easily.  The product beeps as you apply it to tell you when to start the next area.  This way, you don't over do the application to one area.  The charger and cradle are easy to use.  I like the way the device feels when I hold it in my handle.  It has a bit of heft to it.  Changing the power settings is simple and the buttons are responsive.

The gel comes in a 2oz tube and I expect it to last about a month.  More tubes can be purchased on Amazon and the price is more reasonable than I would have expected.

I was slightly scared to use the device for the first time, but to my surprised I only felt a tiny tingle as I used it. After the application, my face tingled for about 20 minutes, but the feeling went away with time.

I haven't noticed any results from using this device in my week of using it.  The maker claims that some users see changes right away, while others may take up to 60 days to see results.  I'll keep using the device and update the review when/if I start to see changes.

I'm still a bit hesitant to fully recommend this item given its price point and the lack of scientific studies.  However, if you want to give microcurrent treatment a try, then this device is an excellent choice due to its great build quality.",1437955200,2015-07-27

I have had hair loss in the past, due to some medical conditions, but those are under control and the new thinning seems to be related to changes due to aging. Thus, I decided to try the phyto first. I apply it like close to the scalp and then rub it in, once must be very careful or it will be a greasy clumpy mess. Running late from work with a shoe in one hand, wand of mascara in the other, and trying to dump this on your scalp is not the way to go, patience and a bit of time are required.

3.0,"Let's see.  The product page says this perfume embodies ""the woman who is dangerous in a good way.""  That, I guess, eliminates use by hired gunwomen, embezzlers, double-agent spies, traitors, and ... me.  I'm just not dangerous, in either good or bad ways, and, in addition, this perfume is not a good fit for me.

Not exactly the fault of the perfume.  It has some pleasant notes of honeysuckle, berries, gardenia and sandalwood, to name a few of the floral and fruity fragrances.  But I find the caramel and vanilla bottom notes to be too strong and the overall impression the perfume leaves on me is of almost excessive sweetness.  I prefer a cleaner, woodier, more citrusy fragrance.  My very favorite perfume even has hints of leather and tobacco to it.

So what was I doing getting this to try out?  Well, in my defense, I didn't think it would be quite so sweet and was expecting more floral notes to it.

The first common mistake people make with a foundation like this, is that using more and applying thickly will give better coverage, especially when it comes to birthmarks and dramatic skin imperfections.

In my experience with it, the opposite held true. If I used too much or applied it only with my fingertips, it's settled into fine lines and made me look about 10 years older.
When using a beauty blender and the tap tap tap technique, I experienced excellent coverage, a nice finish, and minimal settling into my crow's feet and marionette lines.

There is no applicator with this product so I use make up sponges.

The darker color is much darker than I had imagined. It was too dark for anything other than my brows. I used a q-tip and was able to nicely shade them in. I'd have no other use for a color this deep.

Don't get me wrong. It gives a decent color, particularly on the legs (my personal bete noire), although this was probably a bit dark for me. I found the application streaky, no matter what I did. And the idea of putting this on my face? Oh gawd, no!

The real problem with this is that it rubs off. I had this on my legs, hours before I went to bed, and it didn't feel tacky. In the morning I woke up to sheets with tan-colored smears, the product embeded in the fibers. I washed them immediately, but the stains remain. Well, at least I found something where this product sticks, cause it sure wasn't my legs!

I wish I could recommend this more highly, but it's a disappointment. Fortunately, the company's Fabulous Self Tanning Gradual Lotion IS available on Amazon. Drop this, and get that, you love it!",1469836800,2016-07-30

4.0,"I didn't know that Henckels made grooming products.  We have their five inch kitchen knife that is my wife's favorite and we have had it for more than five years.  So, I was expecting the same quality.  This came in a nice box with an outer sleeve. The steel set itself is nicely contained in a leather pouch.
  Design wise, the set does not disappoint, it is sleek and smooth, specially the nail clipper, that keeps flat.  It's compact size and nice leather case makes it great for travel.
  Functionally, the nail clipper is weak. I was scared I would almost break it upon using it on my thumbnail.  I had to just clip a very little at a time for it to bite and clip easily.  I did not proceed with the rest of my fingernails, it just took too long.
The file worked well, my loved the size and it was easy to hold.  The tweezers were good as well, it held hair as I pulled instead of breaking it.
  Each piece is has a good weight to it and is beautifully finished.  My wife could use this set better than I can.  But I can see having this as a quick kit to take with you daily, when you are out on the go... when you need to clip a fingernail quickly, tweeze hair that you missed, etc.
  Overall, still a quality set, but not for my man hooves.",1464220800,2016-05-26

As far as the silicones go, of course it makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  It leaves a thin layer of silicone over the top of your skin, smoothing over pores and fine lines...just like a makeup primer that is 1/10th the cost of this product.  Maybe I am not giving this product enough credit, and in a few weeks I will be thrilled with the newfound luster of my facial skin...but I'm pretty sure that isn't going to happen.",1507593600,2017-10-10

It can be also used a a part of the makeup application prior to applying foundation.  The most similar to this one I used in a past is YSL brand which is much more expensive and gives no better results that this product.  I absolutely love the brush on the tip of the pen.  It is not made of natural fibers, but fibers are so soft it feels delightful when it touches the skin.  One can easily control how much product to use during the application.  The opposite tip of the pen allows for tint to come towards the brush so it can be applied on the skin.  Pen is very thin and it can be easily stored in a cosmetic bag or a purse.  Tin is not too dark. Pf course ever person has a different skin tone so it may be tricky to know which shade one can use.  But if you are using it under foundation, it really does not matter.  It will only enhance and moisturize under eye area.",1487980800,2017-02-25

Of course the directions suggest using the Vincent Longo primer first, but I use Laura Geller's Spackle and it works fine with the Spackle. No cake-y feeling, it isn't drying, it feels watery/cooling when applied. I use a Takelon foundation brush. More expensive than most foundations, but a little goes a long way.

It was on there but it felt like it just stuck my hair together. I did brush it out afterwards but did not feel a difference in my hair. I will just deal with my frizz and fly away hair.

You don't even need to use a cleanser with the sponge, as it is infused with green tea and is, therefore, antioxidant rich. I no longer have to buy an exfoliating scrub.

I had some pretty horrendous brass/yellow colors coming through so my stylist recommended a good quality purple shampoo. After the positive reviews, this is the one I purchased. After using for a couple of weeks it did very little against the brass. I would guess this is better for preventing brass from hard water (which I do not have) than removing brassy color that is already there. I did not find the odor obnoxious or unpleasant in any way. I did find this to be a drying shampoo as well - which I followed up with Pureology Hydrate Conditioner and a leave in conditioner.

4.0,"Ive never tried using a vitamin-C serum on my face, but I was intrigued, so I decided to give Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% a try.  Im in my forties, and my skin is starting to show its age with some dullness and fine (and not so fine) lines.  I found the difference in my skin after using this product to be very subtle, especially after only a couple uses, but after several weeks, I think the overall appearance of my skin has improved.  Ive definitely noticed my skin seems healthier, brighter, and more radiant.

Im pretty critical of the fine lines on my face, and Ive only noticed a very subtle improvement there.  However, my best friend of 30 years recently asked me what I was doing because she thought I looked so much younger than all our other friends our age.  Im sure some of that has to do with common sense changes Ive made like drinking more water and making sure I get more sleep, but I have to wonder if maybe Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% has helped improve my skin more than I notice in the mirror on a daily basis.

While I plan on continuing to use this product, I will warn that, at first, this product stings a bit.  I believe the packaging warned about tingling, but the first couple uses caused me more of a stinging sensation than a tingling sensation.  Now that my skin is used to it after several weeks of use, it doesnt bother me at all.

It's packaged in a very attractive gift box, although not well suited for being tossed into a shipping box and sent through the mail, but thankfully the glass is very heavy duty and the candle did not break even though it was rolling around inside. The scent is very nice when I opened it up and took a sniff up close. Unlike other reviewers however, I was quite disappointed with the amount of scent it released into the room. It does a little better in a small room like a bathroom but compared to much cheaper scented candles of similar size it was quite inadequate for my living areas. I had to be right up next to the candle to detect the scent even after burning it for a couple hours. From a yard away, I could barely detect any scent in the air.

5.0,"The results if ORIBE Glaze for Beautiful Color is at least as noticeable as salon gloss treatment.

I really do like the bottle; and I was worried that meant that the product would impart color.  This is similar to the gloss treatment my new hairdresser uses -- except hers is a subtle dye.  I think it is roughly a similar idea though -- as they are both a glaze which is made to extend your hair color, and make it brighter.  This one is in conditioner form, and I believe it brings out the brilliance in the color and shine in your hair. This is a colorless conditioning treatment.

I'm happy that my particular hair and scalp felt balanced afterwards; though the formula initially felt greasy to me. I towel-dried my hair just a bit.  I applied a small amount (could use more). I left it in my hair for a few minutes more than the recommended time, and then rinsed.  I used a light leave-in conditioner (Redkin) just as I use with regular conditioner after rinsing, and towel-drying. I think this is fair since with any shampoo and conditioner I do this extra step because my dry color-treated hair. As a conditioner this product works well.

I do this once a week in lieu of conditioner.  Nice and easy.

After all was said and done my hair looked unusually manageable and thick.  (I have very fine hair).

I will use this again.  Not sure I will spend that much, but that is me.  Hey, I do at least spend good money on other hair care products, so it is something I might seek out.  When I think it through, we are being asked to pay more than what we spend for a good conditioner, but we only use it once per week.

So, it is important that going in you may come to the same conclusion as I have.  Great product with a high price tag; but perhaps worth it.

The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well.

For reference i have A LOT of thick hair but its sleek... SOOO it tends to get a bitttt flat on the crown... my curls also tend to fade away because of the fact that they are so soft...I spray this in my roots and the ends of my hair and then i flip my hair down and fluff up the root and BOOM volume. Its amazing.. Not only is it amazing at that moment but it looks great throughout the day..if it flattens out throughout the day i flip my hair over and fluff and BOOM volume again. LOVE THIS PRODUCT..,1459296000,2016-03-30

This was very white and almost too light. It looks like I put on concealer and I hate that. If I blend it with something else it works better. I like the applicator.

5.0,"First, I meant to order the 1"" curling iron so I'm going to give you the approximate circumference of the 3/4"" one which is 2 7/8"".  When I hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3/4"".  My hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor. I'd be burning myself quite often if I was using the 1"" size.

I have a 1"" Hot Tool curing iron, just like this one, that I've been using for over 6 years. My husband replaced the plug once because I had to keep wiggling the cord & plug to get everything in the proper place for the curling iron to stay on. Recently I began having problems with the cord again, but this time it's where the cord attaches to the handle & that is why I was ordering another curling iron. This new design is supposed to prevent that problem...only time will tell. I will update my review if necessary.

These irons come with two extra springs...I didn't have to use the extra springs with my old one, but I'm very happy the extras are included. (We've had to replace the springs in other curling irons I've owned through the years. It was never easy to find a replacement spring). The temperature settings/numbers eventually wore off of my old one & I'm expecting this one to do the same because they're applied in the same manner. I have a favorite setting.  I marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so I'd know which setting to use. Although these curling irons get very, very hot I do not & will not use the higher settings. For goodness sakes, my hair isn't made from asbestos. FYI: My hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot. Thankfully, it was in a hidden spot, I don't have long layers, and I was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back. Anyway, let that be a warning to you...it can happen. I've used curling irons for years & years & years & that was a first for me & my hairdresser.  I use the #7 temperature. It's the first setting on the 'Extra Hot' category. My baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl. If this curling iron lives up to its predecessor, I can expect many more useful years out of it.  And, soon, I will be placing an order for the 1"" size.

Great curling iron!",1302393600,2011-04-10

5.0,"So this is a tough one for me, mostly because of the research (or lack of research) around the safety of ALUMINUM CHLOROHYDRATE (AC) as a wetness control ingredient in cosmetic products.

1. Interesting to find out that AC is prohibited in Canadian sold products and is actually classified as toxic/harmful by Canada's version of the FDA.
2. Yet experts say the claims don't hold up to scrutiny. ""There is no convincing evidence that antiperspirant or deodorant use increases cancer risk,"" Ted S. Gansler, MD, MBA, director of medical content for the American Cancer Society, said in an e-mail interview.
3. Back in the 1960s, a few studies found high levels of aluminum in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The research suddenly called into question the safety of everyday household items such as aluminum cans, antacids, and antiperspirants.

But the findings of these early studies weren't replicated in later research, and experts have essentially ruled out aluminum as a possible cause of Alzheimer's.
4. ""The aluminum salts do not work as antiperspirants by being absorbed in the body. They work by forming a chemical reaction with the water in the sweat to form a physical plug... which is deposited in the sweat duct, producing a blockage in the areas that it's applied,"" says David Pariser, MD, professor of dermatology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and past president of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Thus more research is needed. But for the time, there is no scientific research to link the use of antiperspirants that use aluminum to cancer, Alzheimer or even kidney disease.

Thus after doing my research I tried this product:

+ I've gotten products on my hands before but it washes off easily. NOT this product. There was still a film on my hands (mostly because I didn't know how to apply it using the provided applicator so I used my hands to rub it in) and it would not wash off with water and soap. Made me feel it does in fact provide a great barrier. . .better than most.

+ No scent that I could detect.

+ Everyone is different!
I've found this out with supplements and the like too. But this one worked for me and did not irritate in the least bit.

+ I was home lying around for two days without showering and was still good (from what I could tell of my own odor) thanks to this product.

I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",1511913600,2017-11-29

The first time he used it, just washing his face in the usual way, I noticed the residual scent was WAY too strong.  SInce then, he's used it in the shower and with more time to wash away the scent - what remains is just a pleasant smell.

He's noticed that the breakouts he normally gets around his nose and chin aren't as prevalent - not sure about the claim that it reduces ingrown hairs yet. So far - this is a great product that seems to be helping his skin.",1464393600,2016-05-28

5.0,"I am a mature woman, in my 50s, and I still have oily skin!  A facialist once told me that if my oiliness lasted into middle age, I would never wrinkle!  Well, I can say that so far, this has proven to be true.  I have a few lines around my eyes, but not a single wrinkle.  So oily girls, take heart!  I started using this moisturizer recently because I wanted the sunscreen protection.  It is light, absorbs quickly and seems to be true to its mission, meaning I have not noticed any sunburn.  Although I'm not out in the sun for any length of time, just going from my car to the store or office, I live in Florida, which means the sunshine, although wonderful, is a real threat to my skin.  Although when I first purchased this bottle I thought it somewhat expensive, I can now say that I use very little to cover my face, throat and chest.  Consequently, I think it economical.  This company has been in business for years, and although I haven't seen much in the fashion magazines about the line lately, I know that it's a cult favorite and has a loyal following.  This moisturizer is not at all greasy and absorbs in a few moments.  I use a mattifying toner first, then a serum, then this moisturizer, then a mattifying primer.  Although I get a tiny bit of shine towards the end of the day in the hottest days of summer, I am quite content with my regime.  I am at an age when I don't really want a truly matte look.  I think it ages me.  However, I am satisfied with a dewy look.  Other moisturizers I've tried that were supposedly oil free, either left my skin feeling parched or else left it greasy.  I really like this product, it moisturizes without any slick feeling and it only takes a small amount. It also has no fragrance that I can detect, which I know is a sensitivity issue for some.  I definitely recommend it for oily skinned gals (or guys for that matter).",1404864000,2014-07-09

4.0,"Overall I find this body wash to be about what I expected. It's a satisfying treat but nothing to make it a new absolute favorite. The wash itself is fine; it lathers and cleans like any wash I'm used to. The scent (grapefruit variety) is nice: gender-neutral, not too fruity or sweet, and more complex than what you'd usually pick up at the drugstore. It's not a particular favorite, but should have broad appeal. I really don't notice it once I'm out of the shower, though.

The bottle is attractive, and gives the impression of something you'd find in a nice hotel. The pump isn't especially convenient, though. I need about five pumps to produce enough lather for a whole wash; each pump is small so I don't feel it's a large amount, just an inconvenient process. You'll also be bent over if you don't have a shower ledge at a comfortable height. It needs to be resting on something since you'll need one hand to hold a sponge and another to work the pump top. All that to say, the packaging seems luxe, but I don't actually like it better than an average squeeze bottle.

Juice Beauty doesn't do this but what it does do is a great job at smoothing out fine lines.  Besides applying it around my eyes I also put it on my hands which seem to be aging more quickly than my face (probably because I usually sun defying products on my face but not my hands).  The result was that it smoothed out my skin texture very quickly and for quite awhile even though I washed my hands several times.  Despite this they remained smoother for at least four hours.  There's a very slight smell when you first dispense the product but it fades quickly.  It also sinks into your skin fast.  It has a handy pump delivery system with a lid that clicks in place to prevent spills.  The only slight problem I have with the product is that it's difficult to dispense a super small amount but there are always other body parts where you can apply the excess.  I'm also prone to break outs but didn't have that issue with Juice Beauty.  To sum up it's effective, lasts for quite awhile, and a little goes a long way.",1415923200,2014-11-14

5.0,"I love this night cream, not only because it instantly softens without a greasy feel, but the scent is positively divine!
It has that slight sea salt/mineral element that is the freshness in so many 'beachy' perfumes. It isn't strong, and it does dissipate quickly, but every time I put it on, I feel as relaxed as a day at a seaside spa.
Perfect way to feel at night.
Skin still feels soft in the morning.

Because you need just a dab or two, this is actually a great value for a high end product.",1453334400,2016-01-21
5.0,This is one of my favorites. Great summer polish. Coverage is good. This is more of a matte polish - no frosty look here.,1359936000,2013-02-04
3.0,"The first time I used this, I loved it. I was just using a fast swipe as I ran out the door and was really digging the brush. Smooth and natural looking without being naked of mascara. I like to go between natural and drag queen usually, not way overdone and noticeable but not just one coat. I usually like two, with a good wiggle at the base of the lashes for good separation. I hate clumps and flaking. Unfortunately, on the 2nd application I wasn't as happy. I waited maybe 30 seconds before my 2nd coat and it turned into a clumpy, what the heck just happened mess. I don't ever do a dry second coat, it doesn't look natural to me. So this was very aggravating.  I had to remove one eye completely and start over. I feel like maybe once I get ahold of how the formula works this is a nice mascara. But there should have to be a learning curve for a mascara of this price. I actually still prefer the covergirl flamed out mascara over this.",1397692800,2014-04-17

4.0,"I love the La Roche-Posay brand of products, but this one left my skin too dry in the winter months. My skin is naturally oily, but less so in the winter, so I put this aside to revisit when the weather got warmer. I've already begun gushing oil (it's only April, sigh), so I thought I'd try again. Bingo! This works great in removing my makeup, without stripping my skin.

This product is a foam that comes in a pump bottle. It's not to be used in the eye area. You probably can, but my eyes are extremely sensitive, so I use another product for that purpose.

4.0,"As a woman of a certain age, my skin needs a lot of help. The skin around my eyes in particular is becoming thin and wrinkly. I've tried a few different products and none seem to really work as well as I would like them to. I was beginning to think it was just too late for me, that my crepey eye skin is past repair. BUT! This product does seem to be having an effect on the skin around my eyes. There seems to be a healthier glow from my under eye area and the skin definitely seems less fragile. The only reason I am not giving this product 5 stars is the odor. It shouldn't have one and it does and I hate smells. I am giving this product a pass on the smell because it seems to be working.",1501891200,2017-08-05

Apply with cottonball.  From what I can decipher from ingredients, besides the Vichy natural""spa"" water..there is shea butter, liquid parafin, liquid cocoa something.  This really does feel soothing and my face has not broken out.  The biggest surprise for me is that there is perfume fragrance to this..is that a little weird or just my thought?  To me it smells kind of like Eternity!  I mean, love the smell but wow, surprised me that perfume is an ingredient.",1477094400,2016-10-22

4.0,"This waterless brush cleanser works great. It is alcohol based, so it doesn't require water in order to clean the brushes. The spray bottle is small but very portable and easy to use. Just a few spritzes to saturate the brush head and then wipe it from side to side on a towel paper until it looks clean. It dries almost instantly, which is great if you want to use it immediately. The alcohol also disinfects the brush in the process. That said, I wouldn't  substitute regularly shampooing the brushes for this spray. It is great for when you're in a hurry or out traveling.

The brush cleanser does have a fairly strong scent but it is very pleasant. Though the scent seems to linger on the brushes after drying. It may bother you if you're sensitive to fragrance. All in all, this product works great. It cleans, disinfects and dries fast. It is rather expensive but very handy when you're in a hurry or traveling.",1459814400,2016-04-05
5.0,"I had been waiting on the product just like this to come out! Other detanglers have been leaving my hair oily, greasy looking and weighed down. I have found what I needed! Plus the scent is awesome without being overpowering.

See, I have this thing where I like to put my hair in a knot on the top of my head all the time like a loose bun and it causes a lot of tangles. So when I take it down and try to style my hair all I have is a frizzy matted up mess. It only takes a little bit of this product in the palm of my hand. I do have long hair so I use I guess about the size of a quarter on my hair. I use it on the ends and I'm able to pick it out or run my fingers through my hair and get the style that I want without the knots, the pain, the frizzy flyways or losing 200 hairs in the process.

I guess I should tell you a few things about the product itself, besides the awesome scent, it is generously portion and comes in a pump bottle that is very easy to use. It doesn't leave residue on my hands after use. It doesn't take much (as I said before) to get the style results that you're looking for and it does not leave my hair looking like a Crisco trap. I love it and will look forward to continue using this on my unruly hair!",1489968000,2017-03-20
3.0,"StriVectinLABS Extreme Cream has a nice luxurious feel to it. It goes on easily and a little goes a long way. It keeps my skin feeling moist all day long without reapplying. I apply it in the morning and before bedtime. It hasn't caused any irritation and it makes my skin feel good. But after using it for about a week I don't really see any visible difference or reduction in wrinkles on my face. (I have plenty to experiment on.) To be fair, I have been using other products prior to trying this StriVectin. The products I used were pure coconut oil, pure jojoba seed oil, Pure Argan oil, and a product called Gene's Vitamin E Cream. I didn't use them all at once, but rotated them, using each for several days and then switching to another. So, my results so far with StriVectinLABS Extreme Cream is that it's not any better and not any worse than these other options. But given the current price of $89 per ounce compared to around a dollar per ounce for these other products, I couldn't recommend it based on my experience so far. I am going to continue using it until it runs out and if I see miraculous results I will update my review.

Update 7/17/15 - After writing this review, I continued using this product for over a month. I didn't really see any big improvement. The good news is that it goes a long way and I still had some left in the jar. A couple weeks ago I decided to try putting this StriVectin on half of my face and apply pure coconut oil by Viva to the other half. After 2 weeks both sides looked about equally softened. The wrinkles weren't gone but both products provided enough moisture that they seemed less noticeable. The coconut oil is  takes 20 to 30 minutes to be absorbed, so it's less convenient. But it costs a little over $10 for 16 ounces and it's a simple, natural product and that appeals to me.",1416355200,2014-11-19
4.0,One of the first things I noticed about this paste is it doesn't smell bad.  This is always important because who wants to put smelly stuff in their hair.  The next thing is a little goes a long way.  It works well and holds hair like it says.  I have thin hair so I can attest to this only.  Thicker hair outcomes are unknown.  My only gripe is what you get for what you put out.  This is a solid product.  If you want to give it a shot go for it.  I'd you are on the edge I would try something else.,1480550400,2016-12-01

5.0,"This is only my second product from theBalm and my first of their blushes. I love their packaging. It's not only beautiful but thoughtful and practical. Both my Balm Jovi Rockstar palette and my Instain blush come in slim packaging with magnet closure to keep the paper-based cases securely closed. And just to make it even better for travel or carrying in your purse, they put both products in an outer sleeve to further ensure that your makeup doesn't end up all over your purse or luggage. I give them a star for the packaging alone because it rocks!

As for the product, I ordered the Instain blush in Peach, which comes in a beautiful little package with a drawing of a beautiful lady on the front holding a compact. Inside, there is a small mirror (more bonus points!) and the blush itself. This blush does not come with a brush or puff.

The blush surface is bigger than some (like Nyx blushes) but not remarkably large (about 1"" X 2.5""). I like the surface size of the blush for swiping my blush brush across. This blush is highly pigmented, so you will get not only great staying power on your face but the blush should last a long time as you don't need much to get some color on your face.

This peach is intense--nothing wimpy about it. It is a deep peach, not pale, and it has a matte finish. I find it to be a good neutral ground when I want to wear something other than pinks and reds. It's got a nice, soft finish.

For those who are fragrance sensitive like myself, there is very very little fragrance to this product. Just a bare whisper of a talc-type scent. I never noticed the fragrance until I held it right up to my nose and what fragrance there is I find pleasant and not at all bothersome.

I can only find one 'mode' where the vibration intensity may be increased or decreased with the + and - buttons.

3.0,"I purchased the Navy palette. I could not tell the colors exactly from the pictures but it seemed like it had all my basic shades at a fantastic price. However, on receiving the palette I am a bit disappointed as it is not as pigmented as my Urban Decay or MAC palettes. In fact, some NYX shades are more pigmented. It's definitely more pigmented than the typical mass brands. It's not as creamy as I hoped either and has a pretty high fall out.

The matte nude shade is useful as a highlighter. The gray is shimmery and has some gold flecks that look pretty, but it's so much lighter and less pigmented than my MAC shade, that I cannot use it as much. The dark brown is matte and works well as a crease shadow, this one is darker than it looks in the picture but is not very pigmented so it ends up looking a little muddy when you blend. The navy and black are nice for a smoky eye.

If I had known that this palette was not as pigmented as LORAC pro palettes and much less pigmented than MAC and Urban Decay, I would have not purchased it despite the reasonable price as it's not very useful for me. Seems like those who purchased the Nude palette are much happier, that may be true as for Nude shades the pigmentation seems to be adequare. I do appreciate the 7 colors for this price in this skinny size, it's a great deal if the shades work for you.",1414540800,2014-10-29

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

While Bottle Service is part of Essies neon collection, I wouldnt classify it as neon because it isn't obnoxiously bright.  As with most neon polishes, this one dries matte, so youll need a top coat if you desire a glossy finish.  The formula is rich, easy to apply, with beautiful color pigmentation.  The color was fully opaque after two coats and has lasted a week now.

He usually uses the more expensive bottled and moisturizing shaving cream, but this one REALLY made for a smooth shave with zero irritation, zero pulling and zero little nicks.  Quality.

It's very thick, so you add some water to it and it lathers up nicely. Honestly, I am thinking this little tube will actually last twice as long as ""normal"" shaving cream, so it's honestly not THAT much more expensive in the long run even though it seems like it up front.",1418688000,2014-12-16

The product is the perfect thickness so that it doesn't run wastefully from the bottle when you pour it.

There was a silkiness to the water and yet it wasn't oily.  When I was done with my bath it left my skin soft and lightly scented.  Because I don't take very many baths I have also been using it in the shower as a shower gel on my scrubby.  It makes a luxurious foam as I shower and even works great for shaving my legs.

This is extremely expensive for a fragrance that belongs in Bath & Body at the mall.  I was not impressed.  The smell is fruity, like apples; to me anyway.

* It has 16.2% zinc oxide.
* It is SPF 50 so I can feel comfortable using it in the summer months.
* It glides on so smoothly and instantly rubs into my skin.
* The additional ingredients, like botanicals and green tea extract, which can't help but be good for my skin.
* It is unscented.
