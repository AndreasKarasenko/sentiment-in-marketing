I understand that there was a lockdown, but now they are claiming that the order got cancelled and cannot be placed again cause the delivery slots are full! I don't understand full forever? I have already paid the full amount two months back, shouldn't I get some priority over people who place order now? When I use the chat feature they just disconnect without giving me any updates.

It's easy to navigate, user-friendly, and has helpful tools to refine your search.

Poor optimization, inability to change language in region, removal of search category ""solid wood"" for a replacement of ""wood + particle board + veneer"" search categories so you have to judge a product only by look, or by going to the store to personally feel it yourself. On top of that, a 250% product price increase over 2 years gotta be a bug... $699 -> $1599 for a decline in quality from solid wood to particle board and a veneer?? Nahhhhh.",2023-08-16

Only 1 response to my first mail with standard reply format sent, it took them a week to send that. No response to further mails, its been a month now. Cannot reach on call either.

I even got a confirmation that my order had been received. When I went to track my order it wasn't there, rather it was still sitting in the basket as if I hadn't purchased it yet! Luckily I didn't get charged, but I'm now finding it impossible to use the app or website to buy this one item. I keep getting bogus errors and I've given up.",2020-12-28

1,"In these days of the smooth eCommerce experiences offered by Amazon and its ilk it's dumbfounding that IKEA could be offering as bad annordering and payment system as is included with this app. The catalogue part is OK, but closing an order is painful. Lots of stuff not available online. Very clumsy determination of receiving address, PayPal option not working, and so on and on and on. It seems that sales are from the sticks of IKEA branches not from an IKEA depot? Altogether very unsatisfactory",2021-09-29

I really like the list feature and how it organizes the items to the sections they're in at the store, and how the list calculates the total price for purchasing all items in your list together. It's very convenient how the app shows whether or not the item is in stock at the store you've chosen, how many are in stock, and which specific isle it's present in. All in all, the app makes the shopping experience much easier, and I enjoyed using it when planning out my space",2021-10-27

1,Thought the app would be able to let you use the family card to scan instead of carrying the card about with you. There is no option that I can find after searching the app a good few times to put your card number in. Looks like I need to keep carrying the card around.,2021-06-24
3,"I like looking but this app is not user friendly. It just seems difficult to navigate and order. My granddaughter wanted items for Christmas and I couldn't get anything ordered for her.

I really like the new feature that allows you to use AR to see how the items would look in your home- I was impressed to see there's even small items like candles included!

1,Offline? No Family Card! You are at the checkout and want to display the barcode of your Family Card? Too bad as this is not saved in your app for whatever reason. Since there is usually no LTE coverage indoor and IKEA doesn't offer free Wifi in our stores you're screwed.,2020-07-04

No drop down, no other options, nothing. If I change my region to Canada I can choose either English or French, so it is frustrating that I cannot simply select English. I have to use the US version, so I cannot select any stores in Germany, which defeats the purpose. Disappointing from an app in 2023",2023-05-08

Top of page breadcrumbs are missing, which makes browsing poor, and product names aren't linked, so you can't view all the products in the same line easily.

3,For some reason I can't find what I want any more. I'm clicking around in vain and it's never clear enough how to navigate between the different sections to find anything. There are more things on the website and even if you get in to a category it's not evident or certain that you'll find all the items there. Just hoping the shops open up again soon as using this app is just irritating me. It feela more like Pinterest than a shopping app. Wayfair is easier to find and brows for things on.,2021-04-14

1,I can no longer make a shopping list without being signed in. I gave it my location permissions to get my nearest shop (while in London) - the default shop has been set to Belfast. Common search suggestions aren't scrollable. Changing shop is done from a product page and no obvious way to do it from user page.,2020-01-24
1,Every single time you start to scroll it sends you back to the top so it's impossible to browse using this app. It wasn't like a few months ago so I imagine this is a new app error. It needs to be looked into because you are unable to use the application currently since it flings you to the top of your scroll list every few seconds.,2022-01-24

1,"Waste of time Search for items only to be told they cannot be reserved, cannot be picked up and cannot be delivered. So It's the only shop app I know that doesn't want you to buy things. I could travel to my local store and just buy them but via the app... not a chance.",2020-08-22

2,"Seriously if this is meant to replace the catalogue, you guys have got to get your act together. The app is buggy, is missing any number of items, sorting simply doest work, and unless you know the *exact* name of what you're looking for (and even then it's 50/50) it's almost pointless. Use the website... it's at least functional and gives you systems (just remember to confirm you're looking at the site for the Country you're living in) 2 out of 10 - at least it loads.",2021-12-05
5,"Love seeing all the different styles!! If only I'd won the lottery, my house would look amazing.",2020-01-31
1,How does an app in this day and age not allow you to search items that a store actually has. Why does one need to wait until they are checking out to find out this information? Please for the love of God add a function to only show me what a store has available. It has been over 2 years of this nonsense.,2022-02-07

1,Seems to be a bug with new update - when you go to individual sections on the app (e.g. Cooking & Servewear - Food Storage) it shows up as 'No Products Found'. Please fix this issue as there's no point in having the app if it displays no products found in every section,2020-06-23

4,Its cool but somethings cant ship which is weird for me...,2022-01-26
2,"The benefit of this app over the website is that you can save what you're interested in easier and you can access your Family Card. However, the main frustration is still not solved. There is no option to search for what is available locally. So you fall in love with something but can't pick it up and can't get it shipped to you.",2022-01-30
3,"They sunset the old version without notice. I kept trying to use it with it just locking up. Thought it was a bug in the app. Normally there would be a prompt to install new version but they just let me figure out on my own that they stopped supporting the old version. This one seems fine so far, but it wouldn't have been hard to give notice of an update and they didn't do that.",2021-08-10

5,Good,2024-02-16
1,This app is the worst. Order placed 20 still no tracking ID. I am receiving emails after twenty days order has been modified by the ikea without intimation. Worst app ever,2021-07-15
3,I recently purchased few articles online and wanted to return one tray table but the return process of Ikea is terrible. Please work on making it user friendly instead of critical. You are charging for delivery and I got to know that for pick up also there are some charges which is too much. Also not everyone is okay with self assembly in that case we has to pay extra for assembly. So overall my experience was good but disappointed with Return process and charges.,2023-12-14
5,"Exceptional, clean.",2022-08-30
3,"I find that the categories are too general and you cannot go into a specific one as you can on the website. In the age of apps guessing what you want, it is annoying when you already know what you're getting. It's like if I went to the store and I had random people coming up to me and dropping things in my cart like shelves and other office accessories when I mentioned I was looking for a chair... Forcing things on people does not make the experience better...",2021-02-18

3,"Best thing about this app: no unwanted push notifications!!!! The app only sends you a push notification if you specifically request it for in-stock updates, how crazy is that?? Only being notified when you actually want to be???? Worst thing about the app: it's crazy to me that you still can't sort search results by whether items are in stock at your local IKEA or not. Half the items I search for are marked ""not available in store"" and ""not available online"" and I just wish there were filters.",2022-12-14

Because I am calm not others. It was a 5 star rating for me. But while returning it I had to explain the Case to the chat execute renuka again and again. And without asking she closed the thread.

Why have an online delivery service if you don't deliver everywhere. You guys have been a business for decades. It's 2021, and no delivery service.

3,Good app would be better if they would let you make a shopping list like old app. It had sections and aisles and bin where you could pick up stuff in your store. This one doesn't do that. Otherwise it's as good as can be expected,2021-05-06
3,"""Sorry something went wrong"" is basically the experience. Trying to order stuff makes you refresh multiple times. There is also no way to see if in-store only items are even in stock. I just want my Lingonberry syrup, man.

1,"This app is so useless it's almost criminal. I love IKEA, I've shopped there for almost 2 decades, but I hate this app. It will show you/tell you that an item is available for ""Click & Collect"" when it isn't and it won't give you an explanation for why it isn't available. There's no option to not show things that aren't in stock. Even if a product is available at another store, there's no option to ship an item to another IKEA store for pickup.",2022-09-03

2,"Time wasting. Can't sort by size. For example I want a pax wardrobe, why can't I sort by the size and colour I need, then interior fittings for it.? Also stock levels confusing. I added stuff then at checkout it says not available for delivery",2021-05-08
1,"Can't log in My login credentials are correct. When I submit them, I get an otherwise blank reading nothing but ""not found."" I find no way of accessing support to help me. ...use Chrome?

5,So much better than the old one,2020-12-14
5,Good,2020-11-15
3,I dislike the layout of the item page. The vertically expanding section on the old apps was more intuitive and user friendly. I highly dislike the new setup where it takes your horizontally to a new page when you need to see material and dimensions. I usually to look down at the size of the product then scroll back up to see the image again. This is made incredibly difficult now that info is not on the same page. Constantly clicking back and forth to navigate between different info and images.,2020-04-05
5,Much easier to use than the website,2020-12-01
1,"The interface is not very intuitive. The UI can be buggy and stop responding. E.g. price slider can get stuck. This overly simplistic UI can be unhelpful too - why can I only filter shelves prices between $3 and $111 ? No way to input custom values at all. No way to to sort by review ratings, availability in selected store, etc. Update: shopping list just evaporated next time I opened the app. Review changed to 1/5. Update: 1.5 years later, nothing changed.",2022-03-29

4,Faster than web site,2021-03-02
1,"Very badly designed app. Marketing wise - defaults cabinet to an expensive colour which is stupid marketing. If you want to change a colour on the website you can see how much or less it will be, with the app you have to scroll and scroll then select and work diff out yourself. Also basic white not available on app re matod. Could list many more faults but seriously designer try actually using the app - quickest ever installed an app.",2022-06-09

5,Great app. Easy to use,2022-11-09
1,Total rubbish. I used to buy lots of stuff from IKEA and the app is just utterly rubbish. Not intuitive at all. Want to get in touch through on the web chat? Doesn't work. Want to call to discuss an order placed. Be prepared to wait over 1 hour and you'll probably speak to someone who is desperately unhelpful.,2022-10-29

1,Customer support is pathetic. Received damaged product and struggling for replacement. First experience and is very bitter.,2021-06-30
5,The IKEA app provides a way to store one's potential purposes using wish lists that can be transferred to the cart. One can revise these lists many times before purchase before finally placing an order. The IKEA items listed have plenty of useful information and excellent photos. The only thing it dies not do us store previous purchases which would enable one to check items on the order in the app rather than in an email attachment. It can save lots of time trying to buy at an IKEA store.,2021-06-21

When I called up the helpline, they give us two options, place the order again since I already paid for it, but they ask you to tell the items which you ordered over the phone! Seriously! What if I ordered 6-10 items, I have to tell the person each item. Or the other option is you cancel the order, initiate a refund!",2022-12-24

1,They improved but it is still slightly buggy. I had it freezing and crashing on me in checkout and it's just not as good as it should be. That's on the technical side but my main issue with IKEA right now is the unscrupulous thieves that they are gave me a choice of paying ¬£10 to go and collect it from a store 3 hours away or pay ¬£40 to get the relatively small and light item delivered to me. This is insane! How about you let me collect it from the store in my city for free or delivery for ¬£10?,2020-07-23

1,"An app that makes the alternative of trudging through the store for three hours more palatable. Pick delivery to see what cost is, decide click and collect instead, go to checkout, forces you to delivery. No error, no choices, just asserts delivery, nothing else. Uninstalled immediately. I'll just have to drive in and take my chances with it the old fashioned way.",2023-03-05

1,Hideously random. Completely fails to systematically lay out the fitted kitchen range so that you can work out rationally what your options are. For example does not reveal what size carcasses are available or what the range of door colours are. It seems to prefer to just spew forth a totally random sampling and then offers to sort by price. FFS. I love IKEA and have a house full of it. However if this was my introduction to their fitted kitchens and bedrooms I would seriously go to Wickes,2020-05-27

1,"Complete mess. Ikea is pure HYPE. I visited today. There is no staff. There is 0 guidance on how to shop big furniture and how will it get delivered and assembled at home. There are queues everywhere. There is no clarity on warranty/guarantee etc. When we purchase from a normal shop (Even a small street side carpenter) we get a high touch experience, product is delivered / assembled at home. Ikea model will not work at all in India. They need to adapt their offering around Indians, the other way",2022-08-31

5,Excellent app,2020-10-18
2,"Sure the information architecture and usability are awful but the real trainwreck is the IKEA e-commerce ecosystem. IKEA is attempting to spoof the existence of one and that simply doesn't work. Their in-store point-of-sale and perpetual inventory system cannot keep up in real-time with the e-commerce system. You can only buy from your local store but you can't filter on that store or on in-stock items. So, you are constantly playing 20-questions with the system. Can I buy this? Nope try again.",2021-05-08

1,It's ridiculous to not be able to see availability of online until checkout. It's even more ridiculous to not be able to order on backorder. What kind of costumer service says just keep checking back when they sent me two partial orders? They sent the doors for my bookshelf but not the bookshelves and the high chair without the tray.,2022-02-07

I genuinely request IKEA from all comunity of IKEA loyal customer",2022-03-06
4,It's a great app especially because it can show if the item is currently available in the store and where exactly to find it. The only thing to fix would be 1. Give the option of pick up and delivery if one item is not in stock at the store and 2. Give better information about delivery cost. I still don't know if delivery is free always or only after a certain amount. It wasn't clearly mentioned at the checkout .,2021-01-26

Als Kontakt oder Hilfe gibt es einen Chatbot auf der Seite, der nur sagt, man w√ºrde sich melden wenn nicht heute noch die Ware kommt. Da w√§re es billiger gewesen einen Transporter zu mieten aber arbeiten zu gehen.",2024-03-15

3,"Why can't this app let me know when an out of stock item is expected to to be restocked. Hey, I love Ikea like everyone else but I would like to know when items would be restocked again. The old app used to let me know that.",2021-02-25
1,üëπoo Pp üòÅ,2021-06-12
5,Great straightforward,2022-06-13
3,"I like the app, however it would be much better if it sent notifications of items on wish list whenever they're back instock. Also allows us to purchase items from other branches for delivery. The delivery is paid by customers so it would be great if we had that option.",2021-10-25
1,Can't register account,2022-11-12
5,Needs no explanation,2023-10-03

I hope they can have all the items available online (as well as the plants please). I do not enjoy the in-store experience as it's always packed.

1,Actually more than the app I want to rate IKEA Online ordering with 0(zero). I placed an order on 9th Aug 2023 with delivery date showing as 15th Aug. Took delivery charges also. Today is 30th Sep and till date no delivery and no status feedback. Also the app does not have an option of canceling the order also. So the app also is not that great.,2023-09-30

1,The website seems to have more functionality than the app. There is no option to filter by size despite it specializing in furniture. While having the option for custom measurements are preferred even the default ones from the website would at least do. Just use the website.,2022-03-27
1,"I've tried to buy an item twice through this app, and every time I've gone through check out, but no money is taken from my account, I'm told the item is on its way by the app, and then it's as if the order never happened. This app only works for browsing not for purchases.",2021-01-31

2,"Rudimentary app. Search isn't accurate, hard to check delivery/ order details. Out of stock items are not clear unless you click in and in and into the details or when you checkout. The brand is also so good with bundling complementary items but not very good on the app. This could hurt the brand now that everyone moves online. Hope can be improved üòä",2020-07-03
2,The Design is clean and nice but this is a perfect example that not everything that looks nice works well too. The Navigation structure is not intuitive. It's frustrating to find certain items because of the horizontal swipe function in the Menu. It was nicer in the older version when the user could directly click on the sub categories.,2021-12-18

1,"""You can only shop at IKEA by room, no more browsing for new or sale items, you awful customers!"", Ikea app devs, definitely with this update. Worst update ever. The main page is just pics of rooms. And search by room. When I shop at IKEA, I want to buy what catches my fancy, not limit myself to junk only in the bedroom. But worst part, I don't know what to search for because I'm lazily browsing on my couch. You guys took that away from me. Imagine if Amazon limited your shopping by room only.",2022-10-02

2,"Decent app I suppose, but doesn't meet my use case. I downloaded it while in store, to keep track of the items I wanted - instead f writing down a list. It lets you scan items from their tag, which is great, but it won't then show you a list of where you need to go to pick them up in the warehouse. Your only options are to order for collection or delivery (at a surcharge), which is ridiculous when it has the ability to scan in store tags. Why would you need that if you're not in store already?",2020-10-04

5,De app heeft een frisse uitstraling en makkelijk in gebruik. De sfeer foto's met link zijn geweldig. Alleen mis ik soms een link van spullen die wel op de foto staan. En het witte link-stipje is soms moeilijk te zien op mijn telefoon. Fijn dat de winkelwagen en wishlist synchroniseerd met jullie website.,2020-02-14

My only grouse with the app is that there is a disappearing side menu which only appears on an off chance. It has multiple links to family offers, deals, etc but don't know how to make it appear when I need it. The app developers seem to only reply to 5 star positive reviews so looks like will have to use Google to get my answer or use the website.",2021-05-22

3,"Basic app. Navigation can be made more intuitive. Order query needs you to remember the order number to find the status of it. Once you order, the items in the cart still remain and you need to manually delete it. Overall, need to look at other ecom apps and get a face-lift. Good products but shopping experience on app in India is very discouraging.. Good luck. Hope to see a revamped app soon.",2022-10-14

The amount of time lost looking at every single item then scrolling down to see if it's available is insane.

1,"IKEA's return procedure is terrible. First they make you fill a return form post which their customer support team is supposed to contact you within 24-48 hours which they don't do. So you have to chase them by calling their customer care. On calling, they send you a payment link to pay the pickup charges of the product post which they arrange the pickup. That link doesn't work seamlessly either so you'll again have to call their customer care. It took me 5 days just to return their product.",2023-06-16

3,I like that you can browse and look at ideas and that it's organized. I hate that most of the items are not in stock at my store that should be totally filtered out before its listed. And 2 I HATE that there is a click and collect fee to pick up at my store.,2021-08-11

1,Useless app. Ikea is virtually useless for online orders.,2021-07-10
1,Essentially useless. Does not include click-and-collect option and has totally useless product selection work-flow. Uninstalled.,2020-06-20
3,Asks for update every time I open the app. Even after updating. Annoying.,2021-01-02
1,"Cea mai proasta aplicatie. 1. Produsul costa 150 lei. Livrarea costa 25. √émi face»õi reducere 50 lei pentru Ikea family. Suma totala de platƒÉ este 175 lei. InteresantƒÉ matematicƒÉ, dragilor. 2. Nu vrea sƒÉ-mi salveze adresa de livrare. Dupa 30 minute de √ÆncercƒÉri, salveaza, dar numai strada si numƒÉrul.

4,"Experience is good with app but language selection options is not good. Once area/country is selected, language get set to regional language and cannot be changed. Its would be good to have to select different languages irrespective of country regional language.",2020-12-05
2,This update took away the in store availability and where to find them. If I have to drive a couple hours I would like to know if what I'm looking for is in stock. And not all your items are available with click and collect. The 2 stars I gave was because I like that o can access my past receipts.,2021-04-29

1,"I have many frustrations that have already been mentioned. The website isn't much better, but more easily searched. I've learned after many attempts both to order items and to obtain support that I should just stop wasting my time. Carts empty themselves when they're left inactive. This definitely happens. But the one time I WAS able to complete and order after trying to check out for 5 days in a row, somehow I ended up with 4 armchairs, not 2. Fixing that took 2 weeks - support not available.",2021-02-25

4,Super App die leicht zu nutzen ist. Es ist alles strukturiert aufgebaut und man findet alles leicht. Man kann seine Merklisten super verwalten. Das einzige was mich st√∂rt ist die Suche. Wenn ich meine Suche filtere lande ich nach ein bisschen scrollen andauernd wieder oben. Na gut dann habe ich mir gedacht dann filtere ich die Suchen nicht mehr und scrolle einfach so durch. Doch nach einiger Zeit stockt es extrem und l√§dt nur noch sehr langsam. Ansonsten ist es eine super App.,2022-01-22
2,Definitely i like the IKEA product. But not the kind of thier app or you may say features. U cant see your ordered items in you own account app unless you have the Order ID number also It looks like its gonna take forever to get thier items prepared for shipping. Been two days still preparing items. (From :Mumbai india),2022-07-27

5,Easy to see whether it is worth the hike to the store. Really easy to plan a shopping list ahead of our move. Makes the store less overwhelming when you know what to look for. Eg I already know which sofa has washable covers and how much they are. I also have 4 wishlists to simplify what I am planning for,2023-06-06

1,"Hoped to beat the queues by using ""scan as you shop"" feature on app and quickly pay at dedicated tills. However, the over-zealous ""policing"" of these tills, only 2 out of 4 working and some shoppers who do have the app but scan their goods at the till creates delays and grief. The staff actually seem annoyed that I do have the app, I have scanned all my goods and I'm using the blue-bag I bought ages ago... they find it hard to accept ""I'm good to go"" and give me the third degree every time.",2023-11-06
3,"I do recommend just be aware it's not perfect. Clean easy layout, which I love, but there are things you have to do on the desktop site, like sign up for back-in-stock alerts, that would be helpful in the app. I love being in store & scanning a product for the price, that's super helpful! Lost stars mainly because the in-store inventory is NOT accurate. At all. I've experienced this multiple times; things it says are in stock are not & vice versa. Sucks when you drive many hours for nothing.",2022-01-25

Useful new features like displaying branch specific stock availability, inspiration mood boards and more intuitive layout The product info seems fairly accurate is updated quite regularly, haven't bought via the app yet so can't comment there. There is room for improvement though, would love to see the planners (PAX, ELVARLI, EKET etc) integrated into the app. 6/10",2020-11-25

2,"The new version of this app makes it very hard to browse the categories I want to go through. There's no office desk category anymore, or living room furniture. Not gonna lie, this kinda sucks. The old app was great, I don't understand why Ikea felt the need to redesign it.",2020-06-16
1,"App doesn't allow to place order after business hours. It says contact CSC. How inconvenient is that. Same order if I try to place 9am - 9pm, I am able to proceed.

5,This IKEA app is essential! While going around the store I was able to stay organized by adding different pieces to my personalized lists. It also allows you to see if the furniture is available at your location. You are able to pick it up yourself or get it delivered. You can quickly see the reviews and measurements of products to make sure they are right for you. Definitely recommend this app as it will help you on your furniture shopping journey! üòåü™ëüì¶,2023-11-17
1,"Please improve your search tool. Not everyone speaks Swedish/Scandinavian you know, so when i misspell your words, your seach tool does not give results at all. It's not even trying to give at least close to how I spell the word! Also when I search for a generic topic like ""metal wall decor"" it's giving me tons of results that's mostly irrelevant. Please make your search engine tool a bit smarter or at least more useful and less stupid.",2022-07-03

4,"The app itself is fine but have a couple of ideas for improvements. If items are out of stock can you add an alert to let me know when the items are back in stock so I can then place my order. Also, a minor thing, when you register in the app, the minimum password length requirement of 8 characters is also triggered if you go over 20 characters.",2020-07-29

5,"Since the update, it is really fantastic! I had the app a while ago and deleted it because it was quite difficult to naviagate all of the sections.

User friendly for those who know exactly what they want, and those who want to browse.",2020-06-15

1,Omg ikea. Can't use the app because keep saying failed add to cart. Did it with the internet and it keep telling me that I can only send it to Montreal. I live in New Brunswick and there is a pickup point in Fredericton nb. And I wanted to pickup in dartmouth ns with a commercial vehicle but after 3 years I was told I was not aloud to park on ikea property. So I understand correctly truckers can't by at ikea,2020-12-06

I want to make a list in advance to go shopping myself at the store, but even though I see that that's a possibility, it's not clear how I can add things to that list! When I click on the list I created, it says, ""Your lis is empty. Add things to your list"" but there's no way to add things from there! It doesn't explain how to add things. Instead there's a button to scan things, BUT, this only takes you to Shop&Go.",2023-12-29

Forget using Shop&Go self-checkout. You must sign up for 2 countries with 2 seperate emails. @Dev Sync your backends, let me choose ANY store of the planet at will.

1,"PATHETIC and Worst Customer experience. Do not buy online or order from IKEA , their customer service is worst, they disconnect the chats and calls on your face. They don't have good return or exchange policy. I received a tablet with a missing part from its leg and it's been two months, I didn't receive it yet. No replies to my emails and my money is stuck with IKEA, when requested for refund , they said they can't refund without pickup and when asked to pickup there is no response to that?",2021-06-25

2,"Beats the website, but sorting and filtering is still terrible. The search results are largely irrelevant. If you search for a sheet, you get 500 results, 480 of which are beds and mattresses... Also, the logistics is still organized from your local IKEA and gathered by hand, so not only is availability an issue and another customer could grab your last item off the shelf before an employee does, but the whole process is very prone to human error.",2020-09-22

4,Simple & fast,2022-02-15
2,This app has gone absolutely downhill. There's no way to browse by category and when you hit the home button all you get is inspirational pictures that you can then look at items. But if I want to look solely at bedroom furniture if I don't know the exact brand I'm never going to find what I want. I wish they'd bring back the old app or at least some of the options.

2,"Hear me out, unless you a have a car to travel to the IKEA shop near you, fair enough. The reason why I have rated this app 2 star is because of its EXPENSIVE DELIVERY (¬£29 delivery for a slatted bed base) and the delivery takes REALLY LONG (A month and a couple of days). Don't worry though, the quality of the materials from IKEA still is really good. I'm just utterly disappointed on the delivery time and expense. There is also NO OPTION for 'quick delivery' too.",2020-05-19

3,"For the most part, the app is fine. Biggest issue is the limited search options. For example, you can't fine tune your search by dimension, such as ""no wider than -- inches."" Also, and this is the biggest pain for me, you can't search by availability. You won't know if an item is in stock at a given store or even available to ship until you click into that item's product page. IKEA, if you're actually reading this, please add this search feature! I will gladly up my app rating if you do!",2023-02-18

3,"Liking the new app, but I'm knocking off 2 stars because of the wishlist functionality -- it auto sorts to alpha order rather than by department like the old app used to do. If you tap into an item, it then gets pushed into a department ""section"" within the list (inefficient when you have a large list) so you can see at a glance where it is in store, but then it doesn't hold if you leave the wishlist view or simply refresh the list and then you're back to alpha sort again.",2020-12-02

You then click on a picture and the only thing that comes up with a description and price is the cupboard door on the kitchen unit in the background?Though you really wanted to see the price of the dining room table and chairs.

2,Much like an actual Ikea this app is convoluted and difficult to navigate with no drop down menu allowing you to quickly navigate to the type of furniture you're looking for. You're relying on the search function to shop with results often being imprecise and clumsy to organize.,2021-03-28

1,"Vollkommene Service-H√∂lle. Der Online-Shop liefern nach Bonn von Godorf aus, also schreibe ich meine Bewertung hier. Ich hatte eine v√∂llig andere Ware geliefert bekommen, als ich bestellt hatte. Und dann begann der Schmerz: 1. 40+ Anrufe bei der Hotline, kein Durchkommen 2. das Wort ‚ÄûReklamation‚Äú wird im automatisierten Telefon-Bot nur in 1/4 F√§llen erkannt, egal wie gut mein Empfang oder das Headset oder das Endger√§t sind. 3. im Paket liegt kein Retourenschein 4. Google sendet mich auf ein Formular auf Ikea.de, das f√ºr die R√ºcksendung ‚Ç¨3,8 verlangt, obwohl ich keinen Fehler gemacht habe und nur zu meiner Bestellung oder meinem Recht m√∂chte 5. irgendwann finde ich das Kontaktformular, das auf einem aktuellen iPhone XS unbedienbar ist. Meine Autokorrektur macht aus unbedienbar hier zurecht unbesiegbar. 6. Der Abenden-Button zeigt mir in keiner Weise an, dass ‚ÄûFehler‚Äú im Formular bestehen. Fehlermeldungen sind weit oben versteckt 7. Produktnummern von der Ikea DE Webseite sowohl kopiert und eingetippt werden nicht akzeptiert 8. kryptische Fehlermeldungen erscheinen, teils noch nicht mal an dem Formularelement, in dem der Fehler ist 9. Bestellnummer aus der email wird nicht akzeptiert 10. Man muss drauf kommen, dass man die f√ºhrende 1 aus der Bestellnummer entfernen muss f√ºr das Formular! (Ohne Hinweis) 11. Man muss zu den Artikeln, die falsch geliefert werden einen Kommentar angeben (wieso?) 12. dann darf der Kommentar aber nicht mehr als 30 Zeichen aufweisen (ohne Kennzeichnung). 13. √ºber 30 (!) absendeversuche sp√§ter habe ich dieses Enigma eines Formulars gel√∂st IKEA hat den dreckigsten Kundensupport und die mieseste eCommerce-Umsetzung, die ich in 12 L√§ndern auf drei Kontinenten erlebt habe. So kundenfeindlich kann doch keiner sein, au√üer Ikea. Ist nun auf der Blacklist, weder Unternehmen noch privat Word hier noch gekauft, bis ich f√ºr die fast drei Stunden nach √ºblichem Tagessatz entsch√§digt werde.

If by any chance the app decides you're q regular person BUT had the audacity to be born abroad, it says your codice fiscale is wrong and won't allow you to proceed. What's the use of the app, other than wasting phone memory?!",2023-06-02

Some items are delivery only, some store only, some reserve and collect. Some can be added to your basket and others can't. Items disappear from your basket regularly. Incredibly poor and appears to get worse with each new version introducing more issues and solving none. I was too generous with 2 stars.",2022-03-08

1,"Pathetic app development and even worse testing - the app is an absolute waste of time. You spends hours selecting the items you need or alternatives as per stock availability and when you finally go to checkout, it will say that instock items you selected are not in stock and straight up delete the item from your shopping bag and its gone for good. It doesn't even move it to wishlist where you could retrieve it for later. And it will keep doing this a few items at a time. Absolute rubbish !",2020-05-27

So only 1 star because I can't even get the app to open. It's not a good business move to make it different for your customers work hard for information. I'm sure the developers have done a great job. Unfortunately I have no way of finding out.,2020-02-13

4,Innovation with some kinks. Features are great but implementation lacks at times. Ikea has started to surprise me more and more with its different implementations. The latest one being the store shopping feature were you scan the products at the store and then proceed to checkout at an dedicated cashier. While this feature offers a quicker and simpler way of purchasing items the app itself has some flaws. The UX of switching between the shopping cart and you shopping list is all but an easy.,2022-10-31

If something is out of stock, or unavailable, don't remove it from your website or app entirely, just say its out of stock or unavailable. Its really not a difficult concept.

1,"Worse e-commerce app i have never seen. You place your order and forget, Ikea will make sure to delay it for life time. They promise to deliver your order by xyz date and they keep delaying it . worse part is you won't be informed on delay through a mail or message and app isn't having any section to go through order history and status.

I would prefer a browse menu (like Argos) to shop by category, so if I want to view all desks, I can.

I have been trying to checkout an order for around 2 months now and everyday it's a new different issue. Customer service isn't helpful - they give the same excuse/explanation everytime which is tedious and they don't answer or resolve the new daily errors and issues reported. They are very reluctant to help and seem unbothered by ensuring new custom for the company.",2020-06-12

Also it would be nice if there was a possibility to search by measurements, in case you have a space you need to fill out want something that is the same size as something you already have. That also goes for things that are made to fit into certain pieces of furniture, like boxes and such, they should have a category too.",2022-10-06

1,"Every time I open the app, it tells me to download the new app. So I uninstall and reinstall... But it still tells me to go to the play store for the new app.",2021-03-13
1,Advertising stuff that is unavailable for delivery or pickup is dishonest. Over 8 out of 13 items I've selected are unavailable for delivery. In order to get only half the items for pickup I have to drive over 5 hours because apparently it's not available at my nearest store. There is no acceptable reason for this being advertised in your app. One star.,2020-12-31

5,Easy to navigate,2020-05-18
2,Not user friendly. I find it so hard to look up items by category. There's no clear filter button or a category button like it used to have. Please consider making products easy to look for by categories as I have given up purchasing things online multiple times.,2021-08-01
5,Awesome.... I like it..,2022-02-15
1,Major con: The app does not let you choose the language. Only the region/country. Imagine an expat from UK trying to use the app in Poland. It turns to Polish language. Language and region/country should be 2 different options. In a world where people work on many countries through the years it would really help. So app not useful for non-native speaker. Pros: The visuals and UI of the app is modern. All good on this front.,2021-10-04
4,Nice. Can be better,2022-06-10

Update : I could manage to pay return pick up charges of 599. But be careful and take a screenshot of the online transaction page, without which the process will not start.

3,1. If items are not available you get to know at the end and when you get to know you have no idea what the details are. Who the hell knows what's Dvala or Bergshult. I had 50 items in cart reduced to 35 and I had to take a screenshot to compare both actual cart and final cart to understand what went missing. Yes we love in the world of AI and ChatGPT.

1,Except for the older product there was nothing charming or innovative. This was the dullest app. You've ever shown. When I asked to see plates your app. Showed me drawer pulls.

I've been trying to buy a bookshelf from ikea, but everytime I find one I'm happy with, the app tries to get me to pick it up in Toronto or Quebec city, despite me living in Ottawa. I understand its only showing me locations with the item in stock, but I should be able to order it. Beyond that, it doesn't let me change my preferred store, it doesn't let me change my name, and it doesn't let me change my payment info. It needs fixing.",2021-06-08

How easy it's to find your way out in case of emergency/fire/flood or to checkout, very difficult you need to go around the maze. No direct root to safety, there's some small overhead signs not Illuminated still have to go around the maze. I will be contacting ministry of health and safety to look into it",2021-02-23

2,"The cart in the mobile app does not stay in sync with the cart on the website. How wonderful Ikea? Apart from greeting your customers in Swedish, would you rather concentrate on a much bigger, more important problem? Are you kidding me? For a retail chain that earns as much as 40 billion dollars in revenue alone, your stuipid developers forgot about such a trivial feature? What do you expect your customer to do? Oh, we have all the time in the world to perform the same task twice? You absolute idiots!!!",2022-02-11

Tried looking in the titled section for children and you can only see chosen room designs, not options for which piece of furniture or furnishing missing half your produce. When I'm looking for a bed, I want to see only bed frames. When I have a style of bed frame I want, that's what I want to filter, not 1, 2 or 3 seats? Utterly rediculous your not FB.",2020-01-09

It is all manual process, call, call and call their CX, they will ask you to pay the pickup fee, in my case it's ‚Çπ199, after that they will send email for pickup, there is no option in app. Pathetic post purchase experience.",2023-01-07

1,"Uninstalled, opened website in chrome and found what I was looking for in 8 seconds...not exaggerating! Besides the organization/categories being horrible and INCOMPLETE versus the website, the ""x"" to delete a price range does not actually remove the search parameter. And you can't type in a range either. The sliders are useless. A $100 range seems to be less than 10 PIXELS wide.

1,"Terrible, it doesn't let you read about the product or see dimensions. How am I supposed to plan a room without seeing the size of a furniture? There's no description what so ever. Honestly, wth they were thinking? There's no information on this app, just pictures",2020-03-23

5,"Como uma f√£ da marca IKEA, a app √© imprescind√≠vel. Posso at√© nem comprar nada do que meto nos favoritos, todos separados por listas de quartos que um dia, quem sabe, terei. Entre inspira√ß√µes e recomendados... Como se atrevem a fazer-me sonhar e desejar ter decora√ß√µes e m√≥veis? De qualquer das maneiras, irei na mesma dar a volta saloia √† loja.

4,"This app works great but I would like to see what is in stock in the listing without having to click on each product to find out. That little green or red dot is a simple thing, yet saves a lot of time when shopping. Other than that, I think the app is perfect the way it is.",2021-11-13
1,"No multiple languages support, you order can be cancelled after being paid and weeks of waiting.",2022-12-14
5,Love IKEA and the app x,2020-03-29
2,"Mostly functional, but the fact that you can't log into your Ikea account if you don't have Google Chrome installed on your device is ridiculously dumb and very inconvenient to those of us that don't want Chrome on our device. One would think a browser as big as Firefox would be supported.. Or better yet: allow logins directly within the app instead of kicking us out into a browser.",2022-12-22
1,Soon we will have no air because Ikea is cutting too many forests around the world! And not planting any trees!,2021-10-22
1,The experience with Ikea was appalling to say the least. I ordered a bedframe and one of the article was replaced with wardrobe. I realised it only after opening the box and asked for a refund. There has been no response on the email and the customer care executive will delay your query by telling someone would get back to you. The latest response from customer care is to get the box packed by yourself and only then we will pick up the article for refund.,2023-01-06

Usability issue:Need to mention floor number,Rack No & Shelf No in app for red tagged items,as till no augmented virtual reality is added in app,mere Product Code on app is not useful information and humanly insufficient & not possible to collect & pickup item manually if added in list or cart in app.This could save time. Max 6 items in list & 16 items in cart are to be mentioned clearly as max limits in app",2023-06-05
5,"Great site, so easy to navigate. Thanks, Denise.",2020-10-19
5,"This app puts every other business giants' shopping app that I've used to shame, being the most feature-packed at the same time as most user-friendly. That being said, there's some room to cater more to people on small budgets - for example, a ""find cheapest option"" function would be a godsend for things like navigating the 25 laundry basket options that range from $5 to $89. Adding notes to favourited items would be great too, so I can finally describe to my future self why I'm saving something",2024-01-01

5,I just love how afordable and aesthetically pleasing everything is üíñ,2022-06-04
3,"It's not designed like the usual market place app. No order status, no purchase confirmations, payment method saving, no way to instantly update product quantity in the order page, can't contact helpdesk, basket is full after purchase, can't record in flight orders despite week long delivery times - these are all basic features. Logging in to family account goes in loops. The journey is not constructed very well. App lags a lot, not because of network but maybe their internal journey mapping.",2022-07-26

1,"The e-commerce experience is so bad. They only hold your pickup order for a day or two, refunds literally take a week (if I will get one at all), and they send you your order cancellation through a PDF attachment. All of this because I realized I can't spend a raise gift card in store and they don't offer free shipping and I wanted to make the long journey to the store when it was convenient. If you have a gift card number you have to copy/paste it in; the keyboard wouldn't render for me there.",2023-04-11

5,Easy to use,2021-12-05
1,"Unfortunately this is another app that fails on a basic accessibility level - language should not be tied to location. I'm struggling to navigate, and therefore use it, because of this. I'm sure it has many things I could make use of, which is a shame.",2022-12-07
3,"Other app was better for in store, I added all this stuff to my list so my trip was easy and it was empty when I needed it. Also couldn't even look up the shelving I needed on the app and had to use their computers which with the pandemic was not ideal.",2020-06-22
5,It is useful,2023-07-25
3,"There aren't enough detailed measurements provided (sofa covers for example) it's not easy to purchase online when you can't be sure what will arrive.

1,Images never show up.,2023-04-24
1,"A soul less experience. One filled with pictures only in its welcoming screen and expecting the user to know exactly what they what. When a shopping experience should given some welcome, this new app gives you nothing the old app did. Change can be good. But this change should be shut down. It is nothing short of a lesson in how not to interact with your customers. I would give it no stars given the chance.

5,Wood products aren't that good.,2021-09-24
5,Excellent app for putting together a shopping list for when you're shopping in the store. I emphasize in the store! Reason I do this is because shipping for any item is extremely expensive. If you do not have an Ikea near you shop elsewhere,2021-04-11

1,User are not able to easily find their account code to scan. Especially if you are in an area that doens't have good wifi. Even though I have an account I can't pull it up with my phone number and I have checked my account several times. User also can't add to their purchaing history after the purchase to track their purchases. Is a feature that is an on the moment thing.

2,"Frustrating to find items, even if you know they exist, unless you can memorise the Swedish name of product or range. Once you find your item or an item of the range, there is no way to find out what are the other options: size, colours and other varations available in that product range. You need to type (can't copy paste) the Swedish name of the range and go through a long list of all items, one entry per combination of size, colour, variants... then it gets very frustrating and annnoying..",2020-05-16

5,Great ideas easy to navigate and very good prices,2022-02-20
4,"Good app, easy to shop. A major thing I'm missing here is a decent implementation of your previous purchases. Would be a great addition. Plus, and apparently I'm not the only one: a lot of items are either not available online, which is dumb, everything should be available somehow, OR items are not available in 'your postal code region' (but I can pick them up in a shop that is close or even distributing). These two are great examples of terrible logistics. Ikea should really work on that.",2021-07-24

I don't speak the language of the country I'm in so I wanted to change the language to English but there's no option to do that (even though on the IKEA website it says that ""it's very easy to change the language""), except for changing my store preference to a UK store.

I want to see the stock levels (green, amber or red, on a weekly level, like it used to be!) and date of the next delivery if it's out of stock. I get none of that.

So single seat shows all the table chairs too. Furthermore search on arm chair only shows one. Does that mean is the only one available at the store? So creates user confusion.

5,"Best is the shoping and paying using app avoiding queue. Seperate wishlist and bucket for seperate needs. Searching specifics product is easier now. Advice product using photos is not good enough, but that is understandable-several work around and scopes cover this up very nicely. Another best thing, with app you don't have to worry to keep the member card. Cheers!",2023-03-22
1,"This a really bad app!!!!!!! I made an account and an order, when i tried to login it says that my email is invalid and when i tried tracking my order using order number it says that its invalid even though i used correct information.

1,"Sold my phone number! I registered with the IKEA app with all of my personal details, making sure to oppt out of any sales or marketing, then the very next day I'm being bombarded with sales, insurance and scam calls from Switzerland.

1,Forcing the use of the Google Chrome mobile browser when I have another browser installed and set as my default. Respect the decisions of your users and don't force people into a certain way of things. I cannot use this app because I cannot login into my account without using Chrome which I won't do. Disappointing.,2022-02-11
5,There's lots of great things to look at .,2022-06-11

I was previously able to scroll through my purchases from over 2 or 3 years ago (so I can buy a replacement etc) but now it keeps prompting me to input the order number and email address.

1,"Purchased a mattress ,unfortunately it dint match my bed size . I was ready to purchase an new one mattress that matches up my bed sizes in exchange. But ikea company policy says since it's customer mistake please so please suffer and pay the amount to take back the item as well and then start a new purchase great robbing no simple return or exchange in favor of customer cost of delivery and return pick up is half of the product purchased without item in hand end of the day paid for ntn",2021-08-14

3,"The app is mostly ok, no complaints. However, if an item is out of stock, there is no way for me to register for a notification when it's restocked except to go out of the app and onto the ikea web page. Very clunky - why can't it all be done in the app? Also, I'd like to be able to preorder stock - this may be more of an ikea policy complaint rather than an app complaint, but still. Massive hassle to purchase items not in stock. Where's the ""Swedish for common sense""?",2020-10-30

2,"Ordering anything for collection or delivery is near impossible. We wanted a chair and footstool in the same colour. Despite showing in stock at our local store, one wasn't available for collection. For delivery, the other wasn't available. There's no way to know this while browsing, it only tells you what you can have when you try to check out. Clearly no one at IKEA has thought about customer experience when designing this flawed process. We gave up. The app is useful for the family card.",2020-10-29

3,Good app for quick shopping/browsing before going to the store. Easy to use. The previous app was more effective due to the its in store navigation which this app unfortunately should have. There was the mention of our purchase history in store would be added to the app and the guarantee but this was not the case unfortunately again,2020-05-16
4,Yes good app but you can't find all the available range of items on it,2020-08-07
4,"Had to split order to get some items. Had to pickup at Ikea store for part of order and then have other items delivered. Also lots of items are out of stock. App is okay. Just delivery, pickup options, and out of stock items made it difficult to get what I wanted to buy.",2022-04-19
4,Very good.,2020-07-02
1,"This is the most garbage app! The previous Ikea Store app was FAR better. Gone is the ability to create a shopping list in-store, check items off as you pull them, which was sorted in the order they are found in the warehouse. Go ahead, push the button to call customer service in this app. Nothing makes you feel better than a broken link when you are trying to reach a human. Want the number to your local store? Better Google it, because this Ikea app will only give you the address/hours. üëé",2020-12-16
2,"Ikea has stores all over the globe and surely this app exists in many languages, so why language options are so strict and do not allow users to chose English (for example) with every country store (if not any language)?

Searching a product in a language that is not your own is already a pain, but combined with this terrible search and category navigation makes me quit every time without buying online. Please consider to enable language selection.",2024-03-13

1,Your engineering team really needs an upgrade and so does your app. Such a stupid thing to use.

2,"If you select a country, the language (a single language) is assumed and you cannot change it. The app excludes all language groups except a predefined ""main language"" in most countries.

Why on earth would you not add the multi-language support to others using languages in which you already have produced the app???",2022-10-22

1,"Not a proper app. It says that if you don't use Chrome things won't necessarily work properly, and that may explain why I couldn't paste my password in; I'm certainly not going to use an insecure password for IKEA's convenience. It doesn't explain how to use Chrome if it isn't my default. I'm darned if I'm going to change browsers just because IKEA's devs are too lazy to do the job properly. Pathetic.",2020-07-28

1,"For shipping it's $25, and almost 2 weeks after I placed my order, day after suppose delivery date I get a email saying that my order will be leaving soon. If you get charged that much for delivery it shouldn't take that long just to get it out for delivery. And it shouldn't give a shipping date then the day after you're suppose to get it tell you it hasn't even been shipped yet. I took a day off of work to be home for nothing. Very bad first experience. I can't see myself shopping here again.",2021-05-07

5,Great app,2023-08-05
1,"Terrible. Possibly the most difficult app to actually use. When scrolling the list of products you are continually thrown back to the top of the list. Extremely annoying and makes it very hard to look through their products. Definitely not worth anymore than 1 star, would give zero stars if I could.",2022-01-17
4,"Warning: shipping in Canada is $199 (if you add multiple items it stays at 199 so I guess you can lower the pain like that) But the app itself is pretty good, just maybe pick up at your nearest store. I wish I could narrow search results to only items below a certain size. C'mon IKEA, you're designed for small spaces, you know the struggle I'm facing here.",2020-07-13

5,Easy to navigate!!!,2020-12-14
3,"It's an app and it works reasonably well. Woop-de-do!!! None of the things I want to buy is available for delivery or at my local store so it really doesn't matter! Make the product I want available and I might actually buy something. Otherwise, this thing is completely useless.",2022-11-11

1,"No way to filter availability and show what's in store. I've clicked on hundreds just to see they are unavailable anywhere in the US. Why not add a filtering option to ""show available only"". I have shopped at Ikea in the past and filled my house but with my new place it seems like Ikea isn't the way for simplified shopping.",2021-05-08
5,I love this app I can make lists so when I decide to make a few changes the items will be there in my list and I can just add it to my cart. Like honestly I can not express how good this app is.,2020-01-03

5,Very good and easy,2022-07-20
3,Nothing intuitive about this app. I found an item by visiting a store that I was interested in purchasing. It was out of stock so I got the app to catch when they restock. I had a hard time finding how to choose a store. Usually you put in a zip and pick from there but not with this app. After picking a store finding the product and setting an alert was pretty easy. It would be so nice if you could filter your search by in stock but you can't. You also have to change stores to see their stock.,2022-05-03

5,Exellent,2020-04-16
2,Good in general but: 1- Need to get more filters to do an effective search 2- Had my plates broken in the delivery so I need to bring the lot to the nearest pickup which isn't close so not great when you trying to do home deliveries but need to travel to send returns 3- Ikea outsourced the DIY tasks to Task Rabbit which was useless so had to do it myself eventually. Need to change the company or take it back in house,2022-04-30
5,"Easy, fast, wish every app was like this one !!",2020-11-23
3,The delivery feature on the item description page is broken. It always shows unavailable for delivery but after adding the item in basket it shows delivery available at checkout.

1,"Dear ikea, Why all your products are Made In China. Not Made in America or Sweden or India, but China. As an international company you should manufacture in India.

2,Put in my first order through this app and had to cancel it because there was no option to add a authorized name for pick-up during check out. That option can only be done via their website NOT app during the check out process. I couldn't even complete the purchase online because IKEA declines your card and any credit card you try to use just because ikea wants to prevent fraud. Takes ikea 24 hours to clear this payment glitch! üò°,2021-01-22

4,Dilevery issue other wise okay,2023-09-20
2,Today for some reason I cannot access my account anymore. Not on the phone and not even on the website. 2 stars. Furthermore if I place an order to be delivered and I need to change a minor thing in my person information (e.g. mistyped phone number) there is no way to do that,2022-06-21

1,"Absolutely pathetic & disappointing app , take ages to load , they are more interested in collecting our data",2024-03-18
4,"Enjoy the app but on some furnitures it's lacking options to filter by size but there is ""shape"" instead and quite often in furniture a shape is a pretty obvious one and it would be much more useful to be able to filter a drawer by it's depth or height than.. It being a rectangle.",2022-06-22

1,I am waiting for refund from past one month after returning my product at IKEA worki store They are just not giving refund Everytime I call customer care they say that wait for 48 to 72 hours you will get refund But it's not processed yet May be that counter lady at store have not filled correct information I have confirmed at the counter also That lady at counter said your refund will get processed But it never happened Ikea didn't expect this form your store There is no rating below one star,2023-10-05
1,"Its pointless to try and use an app that you cant even log into because it will just send you in circles during the logging in process. You click the button in the app to log in, it then takes you to their website to log in, it takes you back into the app and does absolutely nothing you click on the button again and the same thing happens 15 times over.

4,"If it had a language alternative regardless of the chosen country, it would have been the best!",2022-09-19
2,"In-stock quantities inaccurate for both in-store and delivery, but it doesn't tell you until you try to check out -- then you get a generic message not telling you which item in your cart is out of stock. No copy function, so you have to type in Slaedveyyysren or whatever each time. Tracking doesn't automatically enter into Logistics Manager, so you have to memorize or write down 12 digit code. So many amateur and just bad decisions that I came back here thinking this wasn't the actual Ikea app",2022-12-26
1,When pressing search the only categories I get are bedroom furniture and beds & mattresses. Uninstall and re-install doesn't help.,2020-08-29

5,"Wow, this app makes shopping like a 100 times more fun and easy than any online store I've shopped on. So cool how you can totally custom design your closet system, and for a fraction of what similar amazon products would cost me. With ikea's Free same day pick up,I can redo my whole room the same day I pick out the products I need/want, though delivery option does cost a bit. I now know why my inlaws used ikea for remodeling nearly they're wh they're whole house. So simple so affordable.",2022-09-19

5,good,2021-11-05
5,Easy to use compared to most other shopping apps. Notifies you when products in cart are no longer available without interrupting the checkout process. One small feature I'd like to see is dimensions added as a search tool so us users can search product inch sizes with the product names.,2023-01-12
5,Informative,2023-07-13

4,"The website is better than the phone app. The phone app has precategorized groups of products and it was a bit more difficult to get to specific items. The biggest no go for me is not being able to see what is out of stock without opening the item, which you can do on the web. And there is no filter for out of stock in the search. Visually it is clean and uncomplicated unlike wayfair which has super distracting grahics.",2022-02-04

2,"This new app we've been forced to install is simply worse than the old one. The use experience is not streamlined enough to justify a whole new app. There are sections of the app requiring horizontal scrolling, which should never happen. Like other reviews have stated, my favorite feature of the old app was the shopping list for my local store, which needs to be re-implemented. As does information of the local store's inventory in general. These features need to be front-and-center for the user",2020-12-26

4,"Much improved from earlier versions, still not optimal. New items remain 'New' for far too long (it's almost September and all spring/summer items are still new!) and categorization of products and series is still weird and hardly intuitive. Making lists and adding items to basket or shopping list does function well enough. Although in one list all amounts were reset to 1 when I shared it. I still want planner apps for kitchens and such! Also: I want the brochures available in the app.",2020-08-29

2,"Since the most recent update the app has deleted all of my saved items, which is frustrating as I was using it as a shipping list. All the items that have been deleted are also no longer on the app at all, with no ""out of stock"" notification or anything. Good app otherwise, just don't know why this has happened",2020-06-25

3,"Pretty but frustrating: I can peruse through all the products but I can't necessarily tell what is really in stock at the store near me. What I can't do though is understand everything! I'm an English speaker who happens to live in Austria. For some countries there are options for what language the app is presented in, for others the app defaults to only one. This is such an international world now - so why the heck can I not select the language that is easiest for me to function in?!",2022-07-03

3,"It would be really nice if we could see where to find items (aisle, bin, etc) we added to our lists, depending on the store we chose. Also - maybe because I am new to the app- I have trouble finding stuff. Example: I want a sofa. I click on living room, then appears a bunch of pics but all of them forward to the items seen in the pic. I would rather just whatever list ( words or pics) of items you would find in a living room. It could also be a combo of this and the whole room design. Thanks",2020-06-20

1,"I am not sure but whatever i try to order, if i go to check delivery option, it says something is wrong. Contact CSC. I am not sure whats the issue. I think the frontend is all that you actually focused on designing the app, as a whole this app sucks. When i tried talking to customer care, they said item isn't available, shouldn't you update things on app based on your inventory. It still shows items available and something is still wrong.

1,"The app doesn't list the right information about the products . It doesn't make it clear what part is made of what material. It tries to hide this information in summary. Also, IKEA doesn't publish the negative customer reviews to keep the ratings higher. They delete the reviews. The return policy doesn't specify that IKEA deducts minimum 20% depreciation on product on return. It is NOT like Amazon app where people get clarity on product quality with transparent customer feedback.",2024-01-06
3,"Filter facility could be better. When you use a word search, doesn't let you then filter by department",2021-05-16

5,"Convenient, easy to use, and is accurate 99.99% of the time when it comes to where and when the products are available. I've bought numerous pieces from my local Ikea after finding them online and was never misled or disappointed. Only thing I wish was a little more polished is the wishlist ability. I've had things not add correct or not show it was added then ended up with 6 of the same thing. Over-all, awesome app though. üëèüèº",2022-09-24

1,"Already have an account, but won't let me log in. Tried making an account but it's saying my account already existed. This app is a joke hahaha",2022-01-04
2,"I'm sad that you removed the ""shopping list"" feature where you could see where in your selected ikea everything was located. It made finding what you wanted soo much easier! Especially since the search bar is kinda rubbish (but that's equally bad on the website) having to individually search for each item becomes a pain.",2020-07-13

5,Easier and more accurate than the website.,2021-02-05
1,"Unhappy with buyer experience while shopping online using the app. The product delivered was defective, and there was no option to reach out and raise a concern to the customer service. The only option was to return or exchange at the store, which is pretty lame because IKEA does not have a wide network of stores, which will be reachable easily. At least have a feedback option available to help follow up with the buyers. I would not prefer to return here as a customer.",2023-08-19

5,√émi place,2022-10-05
1,The old version was easier to use and search. I used to add lots to my shopping lists and plan room purchasing on the old app. This version is harder to navigate. If IKEA wants people to buy what they didn't know they needed then making the store categories and departments more prominent would be better rather than just a overall search bar.,2021-02-18
5,Great website easy to find what your looking for,2020-03-12

4,"Overall it's a great app, the search function can be a bit frustrating feels like they are trying to emulate the shopping experience rather than provide a catalogue. But once you find what you are looking for it's well described and pictured.",2020-01-22
4,"Buyer beware! If you try to pay using Google pay, everything appears to go swimmingly, you even get a reminder in your Google calendar about the delivery, but you'll find things are still in your shopping basket and you have no record of a transaction in your email or bank account. This has caught me out on 2 occasions. Works ok if you use PayPal though. Now I have to wait another week for the items I thought I'd already ordered. *Sigh*",2020-09-24

5,Ikea works for me ..love it!,2022-04-26
1,Very poorly designed app that wants you to use Google chrome which in my book is a no no. A decently designed app will be should be browser independent. End users should not be pushed towards downloading additional software.,2022-06-08

5,"Reading some of the other comments I thought the app wasn't going to be any good. Thankfully it's working great for me. I love IKEA. I Haven't been able to visit the store for a number of years because I live in the Scottish Highlands. I wish you guys would open a store in Inverness or Elgin. There's plenty of people with money here who love IKEA's innovation and designs. For now though, I'm happy to look on your app and then head down to Edinburgh to purchase my goodies.",2021-11-03

4,"Decent app when it works (most of the time) (occasionally slow to load items clicked on). I use it solely for planning my trips, not to shop from. Appreciate that it tells the location of items in store and works ok even without decent connection (I know there is ""free"" WiFi at Ikea but what's the catch?) Would be better if I can organize my lists how I want them and also the items in them. And if I could add brief notes (as with Amazon lists) plz & thx",2023-03-15

5,Super easy to use! Super accurate on stock!,2022-02-24
5,"LOVE the ability to take pictures of my room and decorate it in the correct perspective and size. It's amazing! Only preference would be to have ability to see things straight on, e.g. place shelves against a large wall and see a flat perspective. Otherwise, it is amazing.",2023-12-19
