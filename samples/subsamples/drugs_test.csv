I see no reason for anything to taste so bad.  I have had previous colonoscopies and never had a problem with the prep solution.  My new goal in life is to warn everyone about how horrible this stuff tastes and get them to ask their doctor for an alternate solution.""",2017-04-13

I have to say shame on all the doctors who give any fluoroquinolone out since Bayer themselves and the FDA sent out warning letters.  FDA safety review found that both oral and injectable fluroquinolones are associated with disabling side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system. These side effects can occur hours to weeks after exposure to fluoroquinolones and may potentially be permanent. """,2017-04-11

no cramps , no pms , no headache , no nausea ( use it before you sleep or in a full stomach ) , nothing except for a little bloating in the first week and breast tenderness.
hope it works for you too""",2016-10-31
9,"""I started phentermine  6 days ago. The first 2 days, I felt like I was in a fog. By the third day, the feeling passed. My starting weight was 273. My weight today is 266. Over Easter, I never had the urge to indulge in candy, or desserts! 10 years ago I had Lap Band surgery, and lost over 80 lbs. Since that time, I have regained about 40lbs. This medication is exactly what I need to jump start my weight loss. It suppresses  the feelings to over eat, or binge eat.""",2017-04-19
9,"""Have Major Depressive Disorder &amp; PTSD. MAJOR ANXIETY DAILY. LIFE WAS UNBAREABLE. Brintellix 10mg has been a miracle for me. Haven&#039;t had suicidal thoughts, I&#039;m able to work again.. I can feel the real, happy me. I&#039;ve also tried many other &quot;anti depressants&quot; that didnt work well for me. THIS! by FAR, is the best. Worked quickly too. Good luck to all.
Also I am blessed to have the prescriber I do who specializes in PTSD.""",2016-06-19
9,"""My big concern with this drug has been a drastic decrease in my level of energy and occasional nausea. Had been on stribild but started messing up my kidney labs. I had my Zoloft and lamictal increased to help with my mood but no improvement yet""",2016-02-29
9,"""I had to rate Accutane highly, as it did exactly as advertised. I lived with chronic cystic acne for most of my teenage years, and went on Accutane at 20. Six months of treatment, and my acne was gone. I&#039;m 37 now, and have not experienced any long term side effects other than having my acne cured. I tried many medicines to treat the condition, but this one flat-out cured it. I would not have thought it possible.""",2012-09-13
9,"""I have been on Gleevec since 2/2006.  My white blood cell count went from 350,000 to 75,000 in less then three months.  I went into full moleculer remission by 2/2007.  Have the BCR-ABL blood test every 6 months and there is no more Philadelphia Chromosome since.  I still can get nauseated and once in a while vomit if I do not take my Reglan correctly or take Zofran with it, but that&#039;s a minor annoyance since this medicine saved my life.  I would have only had a 40% chance of survival if I would have had a bone marrow transplant.  This medicine is a 95% chance of survival and I&#039;m just about to that magical mark of 10 years on the medicine.""",2013-06-22
9,"""I am  on day 10 of Pristiq for severe anxiety from PTSD. I have been on Lexapro off and on for 10 years which works wonderful for anxiety but caused me to gain 30 pounds and made me feel so tired. After adding Wellbutrin to the Lexapro with no success we tried Effexor XR. It made my heart race.  After 3 days on Pristiq I felt wonderful but by day 9 was experiencing severe panic again which could be due to the switch from Lexapro to Pristiq without weaning off the Lexapro.  My doctor wants me to stick with it for a month so I&#039;m taking 1 mg of Klonipin 2x a day to try and keep from having panic.  My appetite has decreased but I love it.  Lexapro made me want to eat everything in sight. I just hope this works.""",2010-10-29
9,"""Zoloft/Sertaline has allowed me to continue doing the job and living the lifestyle I love. Not only did it lift me out of the dark pit of depression, it has helped me cope with high-anxiety periods of intense stress - on a minimal dosage and without any side effects.""",2009-03-11
10,"""I&#039;ve been dealing with alcohol dependence for over 15 years. Have tried counseling numerous times on advise from previous doctors but always returned to drinking. Finally found a doctor who identified my patterns as worthy of medication. I&#039;ve been on naltrexone for 3 weeks now and I feel like I have my brain back, my thoughts are healthy, I can go out to see bands with my mates and not feel like I want a drink, I have fun and enjoy a sober night. This medication is a blessing and I would recommend it highly. Small side effect of constipation, but nothing a little extra fiber can&#039;t help with.""",2012-11-25
10,"""I&#039;m just about to hit the 2 year mark on the shot. I get my shot regularly and never skip an appointment. I rarely see people talk about being on the shot for more than a few months. I chose this to help regulate my period and for birth control. I had awful, heavy periods before this. When I first started my period lessened and after the first year completely stopped. The only &quot;con&quot; is that I have gained weight since I started taking this. I&#039;m wouldn&#039;t exactly blame this for it though, and so what if it&#039;s a few pounds. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants better control over their periods, and don&#039;t want to worry about pills or something being put inside them.""",2016-08-11

My doctor proscribed me medroxyprogesterone 5mg for 10 days in hope for a period followed by ovulation  After day 7 on my pill I started bleeding lightly. It wasn&#039;t too crazy until my last day on the pill [day 10]. I have now been on my period  for 12 long days [&amp; going strong]. It has progressively gotten heavier and clotty [I have to change my pad &amp; tampons every hour or so]. Anyone have a similar story? I&#039;m worried I have been bleeding for so long.

10,"""I had uncontollable moods of anger sadness and happiness. I looked for ways to fixing it with drinking heavily and sleeping all day. Celexa cured my moods of feeling the need to drink and calmed my worries about life. Without Celexa my life was uncontrollable eating and sleeping and worried all the time. With this I was able to wake up early, get into a workout routine, eat healthily and go back to school without feeling overwhelmed. My friends and family see this positive change in my life. I noticed after 3 months I had to up my dosage from 10mg to 20 mg. I wish the low dosage would last longer but as for that Celexa has helped me in every part of my life!""",2013-06-24

10,"""Wonderful drug!  Now available in Generic so doesn&#039;t cost an arm and a leg.  I have severe disc and arthritic problems in my neck with severe muscle spasms and this really helps. At first when starting this medication it can cause a serious dopey feeling but this can be eased by gradually increasing the dose until benefits are produced.  I am on 4mg 3 x a day and allowed to use 8 mg 3 x a day if my muscles are extremely spastic.  Do not drive when taking this medication until you understand its effects.""",2008-05-31

Also I was always oily and still am sadly And going to the dermatologist to figure out how to deal with it. I&#039;m now 17 and I never wear makeup and religiously wash my face and use a toner. I went to the dermatologist Recently and they gave me a prescription of Aczone and it cleared my face up in about 1 and a half to 2 months. My face burned, purged, and dried (don&#039;t pick!!!!!!!)but it helped. You just have to stick with it and give yourself a Pep talk that it&#039;s worth it at the end.

10,"""Hello strangers. Im here to share my experience of taking emergency contraception, Ellaone. My period cycle has been very irregular last 3 monthes , assumed stresses. Therefore it was very hard to know when exactly my ovulation was. On November 19th, I had unprotected sex with my lover unexpectedly. He had condom initially but it dissappeared.He didnt notice that, so he literally came inside of my vagina. I was panic because of my irregular period cycle, I was not sure about everything. After 17hours of unprotected sexual relationship, I had Ellaone tablet. Regardless how much I worried, my period started today! It was actually starting early then I thought. So dont worry too much! It really works! Release your worries!""",2016-11-28

But then I learned since I take the 300 and 150 that there was a new formulation on the market called Forfivo XL 450 and I take that once a day in the morning along with some Lamictal 100mg and I feel GREAT. I don&#039;t have the worrying I had at work with coworkers, or the mood swings I had while I was at work or being with family.

My derma put me on several different topicals over the course of the last four years i.e. Ziana, Epiduo, Onexton, Retin-A, and Acanya.  I&#039;ve probably tried more but can&#039;t remember all of them.  The last topical I was on was Epiduo until I found out that I was pregnant.  My Dr quickly put me on Finacea since it is safe to use during pregnancy.  I have to say, it&#039;s been 6 days using it morning and night and is the absolutely best topical I&#039;ve tried.  My skin is under control and past acne scars are fading.  Really do love this stuff.  Wish I tried it sooner!""",2017-06-07

10,"""I was a little skeptical at first, given the fact that I went in for a regular Pap Smear and walked out with an IUD. Overall, the insertion was painful, but tolerable. It was really fast. I never cramped before Skyla, so the cramps are my only complaint; but nothing Tylenol can&#039;t fix. After the insertion I cramped for a good 12 hours. I got it a week before my period, so I got my period a week later, everything was normal except the bad cramps  for about 10 mins the day I started my period. After that, everything was normal. No spotting, no emotional moods, no weight gain. It is as if I am not on anything. No babies! Which is the ultimate goal. So far I am happy. Periods are lighter and sex drive is through the roof.""",2016-09-09

THE PROCEDURE: was easy. The Lidocane stings like burning nettles, the rest was easy. Only had a tiny bruise and a tiny scar from the needle (which looks like a mole honestly). 
Side Effects: Only one I&#039;ve had is achy breasts. Like you don&#039;t even want people near them in case they bump into them. All my friends on Implanon have experienced the same thing. 
I LOVE Implanon. Won&#039;t change birth control ever again!""",2011-11-02
