1,Cannot make a credit card purchase. Constantly fails. Can't complete pretty much and payment option. Had to shop through website to complete order. This is a complete fail for an app for a business selling stuff to not be able to accept payment.,2020-12-26

1,"Worst brand ever Bought a chair 2 months back, the cushion are out of stock and am unable to buy them for almost 2 months",2022-09-25
1,Crashes constantly. Utter rubbish.,2023-07-22
1,Worst,2022-07-01
1,Delivery takes weeks and items were missing. Had to call customer service three times and wait an hour to even speak to someone each time. Took more than 4 weeks to actually get all my items from my order. The app doesn't work to make orders. You'll never receive a proof of purchase email.,2021-03-05
1,We are not happy with delivery of products and related service. One delivery was broken in arrival and second had missing parts Pathetic,2021-10-11
1,"Waste of money, products Looks shiny n big in app, realty is clumsy. Once u order online there is separate delivery charges which isn't cheap n then once product comes to curb side their arrogant delivery people won't leave those huge furniture pieces inside the house shouting all the time we are not allowed inside? But do came in to take pics of items when u urself toil hard to push them in at desired places. Unprofessionals who have the gall to say to customer u can manage urself?",2020-12-03
1,This is the worst ever company to buy home furnishing products. People working in IKEA thinks they are the owner of store they mistreat customer. All products are below standards. They will make you run like anything once you bought anything big and want to return if product is not upto the mark. Don't buy anything from here any local furniture store is better than them,2023-06-16
1,"Terrible app, keeps hanging and doesn't work when placing orders",2020-07-18

1,App does not remember the items added to the wish lists when added in the app.,2021-03-14
1,Most items are either out of stock (UK) or in store only. No point of using the app. Only the least popular items are available.,2021-08-14
1,No delivery in Kolkata,2022-07-13
1,I'm currently in Poland but I don't speak Polish language however in the app we can't select language and region independent of each other. Please separate it. I want English language irrespective of the country I'm currently in.,2023-07-22
1,"Scanning qr codes didn't work for half the items, and if it did I could not change options, then at the end the only thing offered was home delivery. So I had to look up all items again and collect them as the app doesn't show where anything actually is, useless",2023-10-08
1,"This app is too slow as compared to other shopping apps. It takes a loads time to get the results, to set the preferences and apply filters. Also prices should be displayed including GST.",2022-03-03
1,Doesn't work for me anymore :(,2022-05-28
1,"Can't log in because the app throws over to a browser which MUST be Chrome, which I don't have. Get with the times, IKEA! Not everyone uses Chrome.",2021-12-03
1,"(1) Couldn't list order history. (2) Couldn't show outstanding order details/status after logged-in, need to enter Order# manually to find it out. (3) Product images in the order couldn't display (while webpage version can) (4) Unable to show 2nd batch delivery schedule (while webpage version can). (5). Some items marked as unavailable in my town still can checkout, but some can't. It's so confusing. (6) Delivery time missed without any email/text. (7) No online CS channel (email, chat not avai)",2021-09-11

1,"I boycott this app, in Sweden guy burn Quran , i will boycott all Sweden production",2023-07-05
1,IKEA is a great company with very good products but it is not good without a proper assembly service and right now they don't have one in Pune.,2021-10-17
1,"What have IKEA done to their app? The new update makes it impossible to navigate. I haven't a clue how to use it, how to find items I want.",2020-01-02
1,"Cannot change store. Gives strange error. Although store can be selected from list, on trying to save it says ""Field cannot have more than 10 characters"". So cannot select store relevant to me",2021-06-21
1,"App is not user friendly. Searching something is really difficult. Example: Search for baby furniture, crib, bassinet you won't find any thing. Search cot you will find it along with adult cot and beds. Searching is really painful..",2023-01-14
1,"Ordrehistorikk fungerer ikke men gir bare ""Beklager det oppsto et problem. Prøv igjen senere."" Men problemet er permanent og dette virker ikke.",2021-02-05
1,"Scrolling gets you back to the top. As mentioned in several reviews below, when scrolling through products, the app keeps on bringing you to the top when it tries to load new items. Renders the app unusable for me!",2022-01-07
1,Nothing is in stock.,2022-02-21
1,Curbside pickup is not an option in this app. Why not? Collect is not available. It is in a browser.,2020-06-29
2,"Just downloaded it for the first time today (11/07/21) and I can't even get passed the very first page that asks me for my region. It just spools forever and then says ""Oops! Something went wrong"". I uninstalled and reinstalled, but still having the same issue.",2021-11-08
2,store experience was bad,2022-01-05
2,It didn't recognise most of the QR codes I scanned,2023-10-14
2,"The app looks nice but It feels flashy and bloated - lots of images and big, general categories but the menus are organized terribly and navigation doesn't allow you to drill down to specific products as easily as in the previous app.",2020-12-07
2,"A little harder to use than the website, nothing crazy though, manageable. The real reason they lose stars is because they pretend like things aren't in stock in order to make you pay more for delivery, or pretend things aren't available for delivery until you purchase them separately and they can charge you two delivery fees!",2022-06-25
2,Pictures do not load,2019-11-26
2,Most things that I like aren't in stock at my nearest store. It necessary an option for selecting things that are currently in stock at the store when doing search.,2021-01-26
2,"IKEA's app is worse than their website. Website allows you to view categories. The App only lets you view by ""room"" and then just shows you a bunch of thumbnails. Actually trying to shop using the app is impossible, unless you know the exact name of the item you want to buy. So good luck leaving Swedish words.",2022-06-27
2,"Zezsx szratक2;!22W,,5☺️∆ezaq",2021-08-17
2,Lacks features. Easier to navigate the store than the app. App has now been force closing.,2022-01-06
2,Delivery not available in my PIN code in India.,2022-02-22
2,Really annoyed that my fav lists keep getting emptied! I'd also like to see all the options for kitchen cupboard and wall unit designing.,2021-01-22
2,"Could be better. The app is clunky and takes lots of clicks to get to anything. All the UI elements are way too large. The share button doesn't work, it doesn't give a link to the product page, it only works if the other person also has this app. Lastly, online shopping from IKEA is cumberson and expensive, so really there's a lot to catch up on.",2021-08-20
2,Nem működik,2024-03-18
2,Unable to find custom list that is prepared,2022-07-30
2,"I live in germany but i dont speak German, the app doesnt give an option to choose the language. If i pick germany as a country of service it automatically sets the local language. Id really appreciate if you fix it. Otherwise theres no point in that app. Thanks!",2022-04-30
2,"Login is so much pain, try any time OTP won't come",2023-06-03
2,"Had to resort to the app to do an online order because the online website keeps up with ""We weren't able to save your address"" error message. Having finally been able to submit my purchase for delivery through the app, I tried to submit feedback which was just as frustrating as there seemed to be a ""refresh"" that occurred after you typed. When trying to adjust previous text, the cursor moves right to the front! Why?? First world problems but annoying...",2022-01-02
2,App won't launch,2021-02-02
2,ich kann nicht registieren. bitte fixieren den Bug sofort,2024-03-10
2,"Tragiczna aplikacja. Estetyczna, ale funkcjonalność bliska zeru. Sprawdzenie oferty np czarnych łóżek 180x200 graniczy z cudem. Prędzej użytkownik się zestresuje i podda niż wyszuka to o co mu chodziło. Jakby ktoś stworzył aplikacje mająca na celu zniechęcenie do korzystania z niej.",2022-10-27
2,Why not give the option of language independent of the country? Why to provide only the native language as the only option and no freedom to choose the language of the app to the user themselves. Please change this for better user friendliness.,2023-05-06
2,"Every annoying when I open the app is takes me straight to the Google store Every time, then I have to press open on the store to actually open the bloody app",2021-03-20
2,"I just cant loggin'in !service does not connecting to recapcha ,and stopped on this step",2021-04-23
2,expensive 😞,2023-11-08
2,Woth Ikea being an international company I think it is poor that not even the English language can be selected in countries other than the UK,2020-07-02
2,"It's so much of the way towards being a good app, but key information like whether items are available for delivery is kind of hidden; the interface for choosing delivery times is inconsistent and inflexible; and if you leave stuff in your basket for a day or so (for example, in the hopes of getting a workable delivery slot) stuff is liable to be removed, seemingly at random.",2022-09-01
2,Products are fine but it is a company running without any ethics. Do not trust their store people working in Navi Mumbai Vashi Branch. They will will give you all false information.,2022-06-05
2,"It's difficult to search for a product, because there is no clear categories, which are difficult to navigate. There are some useless ""inspirations"", which I personally don't need and they just clutter the interface.. There is not enough information easely available, what products are compatible. As for example it's diffucult to find, what kitchen cabinets are available, sorted by size would be nice. It's not clear, what doors are compatible, and even doors and hinges compatibility is unclear.",2022-07-17
2,Shows too many unavailable items,2022-04-03
2,Can't see previous purchases anymore after last update,2021-04-25
2,"Frustrating and slow to navigate. Finding your orders pending delivery is not as obvious as it should be, you can't click links to items listed on your order history. The specific color / type of item you purchased is not displayed in-case you need to buy something such as more drawers for a bed that comes in ""light gray"" and ""vissle gray"". Loading times in general are rather slow for everything. Sometimes it says I can't get delivery until I reload the app.",2022-07-29
2,Log in is painful. facing issues to login since one day. Did not expect such a poor apk from IKEA,2021-06-04
2,"Fairly good app, but since a few months they started using notifications to spam me with offers I'm not interested in and there seems to be no way to turn them off without deactivating all notifications of the app (including useful ones). Very annoying!",2024-03-23
2,If you are one of those people who don't like updating apps every time a new update comes out you are going to hate this one because it just won't stop bothering you until you update it. Also can't change the language so if you're a foreigner who doesn't speak the local language good luck navigating in the app. It's a shame because the app was otherwise designed pretty well,2024-03-25
2,Poor link up account. For example trying to add item to shopping list causes errors etc...,2020-05-02
2,"Lol, won't even open. Tried to see if an app existed and it did, but I can't even open the app, only a crash and tells me to either wait or close it. 10/10 app.",2021-07-30

3,Whenever we proceed to Payment Payment gateways are disappearing. Casuing embarassment,2022-04-04
3,I try to buy articles. When i go to check out they say its free if i pick up in store. I click that option and it charges me 5$.. Im not able to chose the free option,2022-09-15
3,Needs a Dark mode,2023-01-07
3,Pop-up om att betygsätta appen och jag drar av en stjärna,2021-10-12
3,Apparently it's not available everywhere yet. Can't log in. A pity. I'll be waiting for updates.,2020-11-07
3,"Login not working via app. ""Not found"" is displayed. Existing customers need a more visable login-button. A bit spacial and fluffy interface for my tase i.e. a lot of scrolling Tighten it up a bit please!",2020-09-03
3,"It just seems impossible to check in. I also preferred browsing on the previous app. Unless you know what you're looking for, it seems very complicated. Also finding the details on a product is just made more complicated!",2020-10-23
3,Känns som att man får mindre information om varor kontra webbsidan,2020-05-25
3,The app does not show when new stock is expected to arrive to the store just like in the IKEA web page. This is a deficiency.,2023-01-18
3,Works nicely but doesn't allow you to do what you wanted. Was forced to go on here to do a design layout for the kitchen. But I'm not able to add the items or cabinets I wanted. There used to be a way to design a room how you like. Very unfortunate because it would be a great way to give purchase from the website from just designing alone.,2023-07-29
3,Slow to load half the time and the other half I feel like it's broken. Not liking it forces us into categories we don't want much like their store layout which forces us to tour the whole store as if reading a catalog like a book - from end to end. They should include shuttle bus information. I have no car so I arrive by transit. I'm hoping their newest DT location won't be setup so asinine as their storybook concept for their suburb stores. 5G service + 8Gb RAM and its still slow to load.,2022-05-23
3,"Tricky to see much. It won't allow me to add anything to the cart. Continually says ""error to add to cart"". Quite annoying. I live over an hour from the closest Ikea and would have liked to order a few things. Guess I won't be.",2020-04-28
3,I am not happy about this app that replaced the other one. It lacks both search and browsing options that I really enjoyed to get inspirations,2020-06-20
3,Cannot change the language separately from the country,2022-03-09
3,My address doesn't register. It gives me a random error,2021-02-07
3,"I like the app but it won't let me log in into my ikea account because I forgot the password, so when I press send email to reset password it won't send anything... And I really want to create a shopping list! Help me please!",2019-12-25
3,Couldn't find how to add existing IKEA family card,2022-06-06
3,My Ikea app is not loading anymore. I don't know what's wrong with it.,2024-02-18
3,"Their products are innovative, the same definitely cannot be said for their app. The first page is photos of the products and it goes on and on and on and on....... It's a great app to get ideas but I wouldn't bother using it for shopping, its cumbersome, very unlike IKEA which is very disappointing",2020-01-19
3,"So many things good but also few ""human design"" flaws. If they can translate key design in there app like: Dark mode, one-handed UI exmp (fav/share button under image and not top), wishlists; accomodating to last item save list to top of scroll menu (like Spotify does in custom lists), Better catogory visual highlight where in the cato you are (structured tree hierarchy and/or highlight) for the visual impaired! **Clever furniture but UI flawed app**",2020-09-11
3,"Amazing, there is no stock of anything anywhere, bye Felicia go on your marry little way.",2020-10-28
3,Not possible to change language if you are in Sweden. Does not make any sense,2020-05-19
3,Cannot filter on logical things e.g. looking at furniture (like beds) cannot filter on the SIZE of the bed..,2020-06-05
3,"None of my purchases show up in my account. I already bought more things this week in store, as well as online, and still nothing shows up in my purchase history.",2021-06-19
3,"OK, but... Setting up accounts requires going around in circles... it doesn't store where you are up to after reading T&Cs. It doesn't guide you through the store to find the item... the main thing I wanted it to do (like Bunnings app does). It did help me locate an item on the racks, luckily, because the ticket info in the display area was wrong abt where the item was. Hope it gets developed to be much tidier in its operation.",2022-02-12
3,Make your products deliverable. What is the point of seeing good deals and products online but nothing comes home? I'm in Goa. Make it happen guys.,2023-07-29
3,"Very easy to navigate. Great explanation of items and great saving system with tally. However, would never get anything shipped as the shipping price is outrageous",2021-05-02
3,I took the plunge and downloaded it... thankfully it works great... Well it did.... ive tried twice to order something. Goes right through to payment ... then nothing.. no order number no email for purchase. Nothing. Whats the point of the order section if you can't use it ?,2020-10-31
3,"So, my biggest complaint about the app is I can't order anything with it. My billing address and my shipping address are different, which the app doesn't know how to deal with. Had to place my order from the website.",2024-02-13
3,"I could not use my debit card, I had error.",2021-07-03

3,Keeps asking to update and download new app,2021-01-21
3,Please make a Dark Mode,2024-01-11
3,App is not accessible for English speaking customers. It would be nice if there is n option to change language in the app.,2022-08-22
3,The Ikea app is so frustrating. Hard to find quantities at stores and then actually order the product if stock is low.,2021-09-27
3,Input was fine until I got to date of birth. Unable to enter.,2021-05-15
3,The app seems to have lost the general browse option. I can seem to just browse all kitchen items or all fabric. Frustrating,2022-04-04
3,No option to see ordered items within the app,2021-06-20
3,Red 22 23 ee 2 re,2022-05-09

4,IKEA storage solutions are amazing,2024-01-22
4,Works smoothly,2023-07-05
4,"Payment is incredibly difficult in this app as I was led into a payment loop. Outside of that, the software is flawless.",2022-10-27
4,Easy to navigate and it also helps you find other similar items. Great app overall,2020-03-01
4,It doesn't always go to the product details when I click on the item or I can't figure out the magic spot to click to make it happen. Sunriver worth I favorite an item it takes me to my favorites. I don't want it to do that. Overall esthetic is nice.,2020-12-11
4,Mejor que la página que está hecha un desastre.. No me dejaba ni colocar la dirección de envío.,2022-02-07
4,Nice products,2020-01-25
4,"IKEA app is well categorized and organized and I like using it to browse for furniture that would work with my apartment, no matter which apartment. Even better it has my history of purchases which is great, especially since it's always hard to keep receipts. Only thing that's confusing is certain items isn't it's categories as expected. Otherwise it's great app to use with no hitch! Aswell as sharing links to other's who do not have the IKEA app does not work.",2023-06-30
4,Good :),2022-10-26

4,Easy to use app. Alot of information and details provided for each article. Clear instructions for delivery.,2022-11-30
4,"The app is easy to use, but I wish there was a PAX Wardrobe design tool built into the app, OR at least a search result for ""PAX design tool"" that indicates clearly that the pax wardrobe design tool is only available on the desktop website.",2022-03-17
4,Very good app,2021-06-04

4,"Works well, not as much fun as a visit to the store.",2020-04-02
4,"The new app is significant leap from the previous one. However, when you search for a product, the inspiration images that pop do not have other products linked in. This could lead to shop other unrelated products in these images rather having to find them. The app also doesn't seem to be connected to the offers going on in the stores or launch of new range/ items",2021-01-25

5,Love that the app gives me access to the store. Helps to make a shoping plan in great detail. Love the items divided into room categorys. Love that you can find new ideas in displayed areas and rooms. Suggestion: App should also include shortcut to items that have action prices.,2023-02-14

5,"IKEAs app och allmänna köpupplevelse online och offline är verkligen best-in-class! Verkligen grymt jobbat av alla involverade. En liten buggdetalj är: vid självskanning av varor får jag ibland false-negatives i termer av att den inte hittar varan. När jag skannar igen brukar det fungera. Det vore bra om detta fungerade mer sömlöst, eller åtminstone att man kan skilja på en otillräcklig skanning och att varan faktiskt inte finns.",2022-10-22
