1.0,"This nozzle seemed to be well made and it worked great for a few weeks.After about 2 months of occasional use (maybe used it 4-5 times during that time), the whole nozzle started to leak water everywhere. Another reviewer mentioned that the internal components of this nozzle are made from cheap plastic and will break easily from regular use, and it seems they were right. No pressure at all on the trigger and there is water going everywhere. I just turn on the hose and immediately this nozzle starts leaking water.Don't waste your money, get something better.",1355529600,2012-12-15
1.0,"I think I've tried everything now to get rid of fungus gnats.  This stuff didn't do much if anything.  The yellow stickies caught bunches but barely slowed them.  I let the plants dry until nearly dead, I tried teas, spices, soaps, Neem, and everything else I found or heard about. I finally got rid of them by scraping off the top 1"" layer of soil and replacing it with sand.",1316649600,2011-09-22
1.0,"A key thing to realize with this trap's bait is that it killed the mice when there was no other food to be had. That suggests that, out in the real world, a mouse would rather wander off and eat something else rather than take a big blue bite of the brick inside this bait station. I can say, with certainty, that the mice snacking on my garden have zero interest in this product.",1401494400,2014-05-31
1.0,"It reads on the back, ""Not for children under 6 or to be used around pets"".  ""Wash off skin while inside"".So, this is pretty much useless if you have an indoor mosquito and tick problem like I do.  I travel and work on a freight boat where mosquito and tick are common amongst the dirty, smelly crew.  I sleep in a hammock.The active ingredients cause skin burn, nose rash and general discharge of the eye Mucous membrane.  So if you need it to sit on a sofa or bed, you'll get the active ingredients all over the place.",1285459200,2010-09-26
1.0,"Great looking base, but does not fit Q100 grill. Fits all of the others, but not the 100 model. Stupid! I will probably end up rigging a base platform for the Q100 to sit on, maybe out of cement backerboard. It is good looking, and does a nice job of hiding the propane tank. Some of the nuts weren't machine right resulting in a trip to the hardware store.",1245542400,2009-06-21
1.0,"We bought two gallons of Wet and Forget at Costco. Applied per directions to some very moldy/ mildewey wood decking as well as a very mildewey painted wall and waited as directed. After 3 months of zero improvement, we applied again and scrubbed with a brush, (but did not rinse). This loosened up about 50% of the black mildew and with the next rains, it rinsed away. One year later, we can see some minor ""peeling"" effect of the remaining mildew layer on about 25% of the deck, but most of the deck simply returned to it's original back nastiness. I would say that the mildew has actually gotten worse over the last year, not better. We finally pressure washed it and then reapplied the wet and forget thinking that it might help prevent the return on the black mildew, but it hasn't. In the deck areas that get hit by the sprinklers, the wood is black again after only 4 months. The moldy wall never improved beyond our scrubbing efforts despite reapplication of the Wet and Forget. I don't know if the product just can't perform in extreme hot/humid conditions like South Florida or we got a bad batch, but I would not recommend this product. We went back to pressure washing after one year of trial with Wet and Forget. Pressure washing takes about the same amount of time to do as applying W&F and results are instant and beautiful.",1294272000,2011-01-06
1.0,"Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily ""Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally"", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles. The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. They replied that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders. They also explicitly stated that they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder. Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it. This feeder has many _great_ properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives (of which there are plenty) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so.",1398470400,2014-04-26
1.0,"I want to start out saying that anyone that wants to save a mouse is borderline retarded.  They are disease carrying vermin on the bottom of the food chain.  When caught by a fox, cat or other predator, they are slowly torn apart live or chewed live.  Setting one loose in the woods thinking you are saving it will likely do one of two things.  1. Sentence it to a much more violent and cruel death.  2. Allow it to breed so you can have hundreds (yes, hundreds) more in its place.  And many of these will find their way into homes.I tried these traps along side much much cheaper glue traps and snap traps.  The glue traps and snap traps were effective.  Not one of these caught a gosh darned thing.  When placed adjacent to traps of other types, they never touched the bait on the door entrance and never went in, but were snapped or glued instead every time.The mice choose the death traps over and over in favor of these useless pieces of plastic junk.  And now that I have them, they will likely end up at a local dump for 50000 years before they break down.Nice.",1307750400,2011-06-11
1.0,"I think we can all agree that this is a very cool concept.  This hose is very capable, very light, very portable - it's just about perfect in the whole concept department.  The only problem is that it has no lasting power.  The fittings are all in plastic and hardly durable.  The hose itself can't be left out in the sun - the sun will break it down.  Then it's not even durable because even when you are super careful with it, it can still develop leaks.  The outer covering is a strange, crunchy material that fades in the sun - none of it seems up to par for durability.  I think this is useful maybe for times when you need a portable hose - this has to be the most portable hose around...but you can't rely on it, so I'm not sure if the convenience of the portability is worth not knowing if it will last for you and when it will break for no reason at all.  I cannot recommend this item.",1379548800,2013-09-19
1.0,"At first I thought this product might be awesome -- the idea is that you find an active mole tunnel (the directions tell you how to determine that) then you use the pointy end to open a hole and then put some of the pellets into the tunnel so that the mole will eat it and die.However every time I used the product as instructed the moles never returned to that tunnel. I think this was for two reasons.First the test to find an active tunnel is to push said mounds done then check to see if they are back up the next day... the process of using the bottle's pointed end though also collapses part of the tunnel and if I were a mole and my tunnel had a collapsed section two days in a row, I'd find me a new tunnel (which is what they seemed to have done).Second the process of making said hole to pour the pellets into not only collapses the tunnel around it but actually blocks off the tunnel at that point.  Once more the moles just made a new tunnel.Very disappointing.",1402963200,2014-06-17

1.0,"I have had this set out for about two weeks.  It hasn't caught one rat or mouse!  However, the first night I had it out, something did try to eat the bait (dog food).  When I got up the next morning, I discovered the Rat Zapper turned upside down, with the battery cover dislodged and the batteries (and bait) strewn a couple feet from the trap.  Apparently, it has enough of a zap to royally tick off whatever critter wanted the bait, but not enough to kill it.I put the batteries back in and re-baited (and reset) the trap.  Two days later, the kill light was flashing, and I eagerly looked inside.  The trap was empty.  Not only was there no critter in the trap, but the bait was gone.I gave it one more try.  Put more dog food (and peanut butter smeared in a soda pop top -- you can't put wet bait directly on the bait tray), and then I reset the trap.  It has been almost two weeks, and except for the bait, it sits empty.  I guess the critters learned their lesson, and they've decided to leave the trap alone, but still infest my property.I can't recommend a trap that merely annoys its intended victim, but doesn't kill it.",1373673600,2013-07-13
1.0,"I have two gardens, one off of each end of the house. They need a lot of watering. It's always been extra work adjusting the water flow from the hose. (Walking back and forth to the house each time). I tried the hose ""Y's"" which have a switch to adjust the flow at the garden, but they're on the ground, generally upside down and are hard to adjust since the levers are very small.The Bib Extender has been placed next to the garden with the hose attached. With the faucet on at the house, it is an easy and convenient way to adjust the water flow.  It is up a couple of feet and has a good faucet handle. The shaft which goes into the ground is very solid and the whole unit is simple. I did find that it is important to use a pliers to tighten the hose connection onto the Bib Extender to prevent leaks. I also find this true on the house faucets since the ""rubber"" seals are generally plastic, not rubber anymore. I have had the water on at the house for a few days and see no problem with leaking. I will just leave the water on at the house and use only the Bib Extender for turning on and off the water and making adjustments.As of May 24, 2014 the on/off handle broke off in just normal use. The product should not be purchased.",1398643200,2014-04-28
1.0,"In my experience, it always takes a few days before for the birds start eating from the newly hung feeder, and this feeder was no exception.  It is the second feeder in my front  yard, the first being a Brome.  And so far, the birds still prefer the Brome to the No/No feeder.  The No/No feeder has very little rain protection for the seeds, as the mesh part, where the seeds are, is completely open.Also, if purchasing this feeder, it does not include a hook to hang it in a tree, just the handle on top of the feeder.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- changing rating from 4 stars to 1.  The seeds stay piled up in the middle of the feeder and do not slide down to the tray or sides without help.  So I finally removed it from the tree as I find it to much work to keep shaking the seeds down.  And I really dislike the fact of taunting birds with seeds just out of reach.",1367971200,2013-05-08
1.0,"The coons steal the bait from this trap at will. I've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it wouldn't engage the trip at first.

1.0,"I bought this smoker and great hopes for it, but quickly ran into problems. The smoker/wood chip area comes in two parts - a holder box and a tray. The holder box was not attached correctly and where you put in the chips was not even attached to the side of the box correctly. It was at an angle. The smoker tray I received seemed to have been manufactured in an incorrect size and wouldn't fit in the holder. The tray also seems to have been made from very thin and cheap metal. I can't imagine that it would last very long. Screws were missing for the electronic controls. As a result I couldn't even put it together and ended up taking it back.I guess the 90 day warranty should have been a clue, but Amazon doesn't mention that fact.Admittedly this is an inexpensive Chinese made smoker, but the quality I got is the worst I've ever had in a consumer product. I am still looking for an electric smoker, but will go for a more expensive stainless steel model. Most of these come with two year parts warranties.Buyer Beware.Addon - Masterbuilt finally admitted that I had a faulty unit and sent me a replacement.

1.0,"I am a Droll Yankee bird feeder fan. I have had their feeders mauled by bears and with a little TLC, have come back for more. The Perky-Pet 5141-2 arrived today in a box that wasn't dented or damaged in any way. When I opened it, the feeder inside was in three pieces. The feeder was ""packed"" with three small air-filled cushions in a huge box so it rolled around freely and experienced every shock that is the normal part of shipping. I thought about just sending it back and not doing a review until it was replaced, but I decided that the best way to support fellow Amazon customers is to give a realistic impression of both the product and how likely it is to arrive in a hassle-free, undamaged manner.So, here are the facts: The feeder was packed without consideration for how it might be handled in transit. The cover over the feeder's ports was cracked - most probably from poor packing and / or poor quality construction. The barrel that holds the seed was glued poorly to the heavy metal, spring-loaded base - I counted only 2 spots where there seemed to be evidence of plastic cement, barely covering 30 to 40% of the contact surface. When I thought I could re-glue the pieces together, I discovered that the parts didn't seat together well enough to do that. (Actually the parts didn't seat together at all.)My wife, ever the optimist, said, ""it makes me wonder how long this thing would have held up if it was getting banged around by a determined squirrel (are there any other kinds?). The kind of question I suppose you are asking yourself now...Bottom line - poor packaging, shoddy construction, broken on arrival.Not recommended.",1377475200,2013-08-26
1.0,"The .7Kg / 25 oz Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac, designed and engineered in Germany and made in Hungary, is packaged as four pieces which quickly snap together.  The tank snaps onto the handle section which contains the motor works and rechargeable lithium ion battery, then the vacuum neck snaps into the handle section, locking the tank into place.  Lastly, the blade assembly snaps into the vacuum neck.  Fully assembled, the device stands 14"" / 356 mm tall, 4.75"" / 121 mm deep, and 3.5"" / 89 mm wide at the base and 11"" / 280 mm wide at the wiper blade.According to the instructions on the box, all that's required is to spray the surface with cleaning solution then vac-wipe.  On relatively clean mirrors in the bathroom the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac worked well enough.  When I tried this approach on dirty exterior windows and wound up with a streaky mess.  I went to the product website for additional information and found the online instructions require a three step process. Spray the surface with detergent, clean the surface with a microfiber cloth, then vacuum the liquid away.  Once done, empty the tank and recharge the battery for next time.Between the small tank and the need to scrub the windows first, it's easier to just use a standardwindow washing squeegee.Being promoted as being able to clean windows, mirrors, condensation, showers, car windows, spills, and auto bodies, I grabbed the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac to clean up a significant spill in our bar.  The Karcher wet vac started sucking up the liquid, then would spit it out the side venting and shut down.  As a device to clean up spills, the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac fails to deliver, and made a bigger mess on my cabinets.I am so disgusted by the ineffectiveness and uselessness of the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac I wish I could return it, or better yet destroy it with a sledge hammer.

1.0,"First let me make it VERY clear that Amazon.com is ALWAYS the best.  Top notch shipping, friendly/professional customer service, timely delivery.  I absolutely love Amazon.com - NEVER have had a single problem.Weber makes incredible products, I personally own three Weber Grills and every family member and most of my friends have since purchased at least one because they admire mine so much.  Now comes in to play Weber Customer Service.....I purchased this smoker Thursday 9/3/09 and had it shipped over night, which of course Amazon.com did perfectly.  Since I knew the smoker was at the house so I stopped at my favorite butcher on the way home from my office, purchasing roughly $200 in meat.  It was to be a great Labor Day Celebration with fine cuts of smoked meat at our annual End of Summer Bash.  I came home and excitedly started putting together the smoker.  However, the charcoal grate simply would not fit, something was amiss.... I called Weber customer service and was notified that I was the 3rd person to call that day with the exact same problem.  In the factory, someone was putting the charcoal grates for the larger Weber smoker in this package which need the smaller.  The customer service representative was incredibly kind and apologetic.  They said they would over night the charcoal great and refund what I had purchased in meat.  I was saddened that my guests would not enjoy what I had so anxiously hoped to serve, but understood that mistakes do indeed happen, and that Weber was doing all it could to make things right.  The party must go on.After the long holiday weekend, Tuesday comes and I expect to come home to a nice fedex package on my front porch containing said charcoal grill.  As I pulled in the drive and to my dismay, no fedex package existed.  Thus, I call Weber customer service.  The first rep. said there was nothing in my ""file"" and that they would never agree to reimburse for the meat - unbelievably rude.  I asked for a supervisor, and was of course, somehow was disconnected.  I called back, and after three attempts finally a supervisor came to the phone.  They said they would be sure to over night the correct grate to me, and they would have to check on the meat reimbursement.  At this point, I didn't care as long as what I already had purchased would finally be complete.Wednesday comes, no grate....I give it another day.....Thursday, no grate.  Four more calls to Weber, two different rude, unprofessional supervisors and assurance the grate would come over night.  Friday....no grate.  Yet another call to Weber, more rude customer service reps and supervisors then a notification that the grate wouldn't ship until October 8th, this would not do at all.  Finally get the VP of Customer Service for Weber, a fellow named Mark.  I understand how he came to his position, you clearly need to be the best at being rude and unprofessional to hold such a prestigious position at Weber.  He of course assured me that they would ship a grate over night and I will receive the grate Tuesday.I for one feel that it was completely ridiculous what I had to go through just to get the product I had already purchased.  This was by far the WORST customer service I've ever received from any company.  I will no longer purchase another Weber product regardless of the quality.  I would rather buy a new grill every year for the rest of my life rather than cook on another Weber.Weber, you have lost a life long customer and several thousands of dollars because of something so ridiculous.  I will never recommend a Weber product again, nor will anyone I know purchase another Weber product.  I will personally purchase from another company and give it to them just to avoid another dollar going into a company that condones such poor customer service......Good Bye Weber!",1252627200,2009-09-11

I know all about proper baiting and placement of traps, and I definitely have mice in my attic, but they won't go near the Kill and Seal.  The only difference between this trap and a regular spring-loaded trap is that this one has a cover over it so you don't have to see the dead mouse or look at it.  That is the only advantage, yet you're paying several dollars per trap more.  I guess another advantage is that the mice can't steal the bait from the trap, but that doesn't really matter if they never go for it.Unfortunately, the best mouse trap available is a glue trap.  However I think they are incredibly inhumane and an awful way to kill mice and rats.  If you absolutely have to get rid of mice and no other way is working, that is your best bet.  If you are looking for something similar to this trap and don't mind seeing a dead mouse, try theSnap-E Mouse Trap.  If you are looking to get rid of rats and have some money to burn, the best thing I've found is theAgri Zap RZU001 Rat Zapper Ultra(this product will not work with rats so make sure you know that your problem is mice).The Victor Kill & Seal is a good idea but poor execution and way too expensive for a single use product.",1290038400,2010-11-18
1.0,"As with many of these types of hoses, there are too many restrictions on use and how you must use it. As they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks nor can you expect someone to change how they have used garden hoses all their lives. You are supposed to follow a specific method for initially operating the hose. Another factor in rating it a 1 is there is no manufacturer contact information included with the hose. None on the box and none in the directions. I also tried to find the manufacturer on the internet and no luck there either.If the hose goes bad, you are simply out of luck. Another concern is that this hose is not to be used for drinking water. Makes me wonder what is leaching out from this hose into the water and worry also about pets or animals drinking water that came out of this hose. The better option is a 50' coiled hose which we have two of. I bought two very good quality coiled hoses and have been using them for 3 seasons now without any problems.

1.0,"I really like the Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap version . . . powerful, easy to set, and well-designed for a reliable catch/kill.  I looked forward to good results from this Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap, and in fact had a ready test subject targeted, as my daughter had been reporting a mouse intruder in her 100 year old Victorian home with dungeon like basement.  I told her to hold off on deploying her old wood traps so I could  try out these just-received Tomcat Mouse Snap Traps.This mouse version of the trap was indeed, like the rat version, easy to set.  Just push on the heel of the lid, and it pivots and locks open.  That was where the good times ended.First problem was stolen bait.  I didn't have any of the recommended ""Tomcat Mouse Attractant Gel"" in my possession, so I tried pressing on a little glob of trusty sharp cheddar.  Problem is there's really nothing to press the bait onto but an essentially smooth plastic bait/trip platform.  I suspected the bait might get stolen.  It was.  And the second try also.  By this time, I was sure the mouse would be back for try number three, as this trap was just essentially functioning as a feeding station.This third try, I fashioned a paper clip to slip over the edge of the bait/trip platform and help hold the bait in place.  It worked.  A successful capture this time, but . . . .It didn't kill the mouse.  I was left with the task of having to put a trembling badly injured mouse out of its suffering.  I felt as sorry for the little guy as I would have a suffering dog or cat, and felt terrible for having put it in this state of injury.  I have trapped many mice over the years with the old-fashioned wooden Victor type traps.  Nine out of ten times (or more) they produced an instant kill.  That's what I'm looking for.I give the Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap a star for being easy to set with no pinched fingers, and they are indeed not likely to injure your children or pets.  But I consider these traps unacceptably inhumane and will not use these Tomcat mouse traps again.",1404432000,2014-07-04

The Perky-Pet Top Fill Bird Waterer is a good idea failed.There are so many things wrong with this design that it is embarrassing. Only small birds possibly could sit on the flimsy plastic base ring and turn in just a way to drink water that is, if water stayed in the container and didn't leak on the ground. Our container lost all its water in just over an hour. On a positive note, you don't have to worry about water getting stale or dirty as you do in a bird bath.  This design doesn't even work as a last resort for hummingbirds because there ain't no water there. Nuf said.

2.0,"This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients.  It even looks like pepper, and smells somewhat like pepper.  The three main, active ingredients are:#1.  Oil of black pepper:  0.48% by weight.#2.  Piperine (comes from black pepper): 0.185% by weight.#3.  Capsaicin: 0.032% by weight.The other 99.3% are ""other ingredients"".When you open the big blue jug, please note, it is five pounds by weight, but the jug is about 3/4 full, so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.I used it around the perimeter of my home, which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats, chipmunks, and deer.  I also have a pet dog and cat.  I did not expect miracles, and as with any product of this type, you need to accept that it is a deterrent, which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors, nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals, I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times.  Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property.  I tried a couple of applications in various places.  None of the chipmunks, cats, squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all.  I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions.  In fact, I ended up applying it heavier than instructed, and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.But, if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach, I do not see any reason to pay $5 or $6 a pound for this product.  5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces.  Since the active ingredients (various forms of pepper) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar, or about half an ounce, you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own, homemade powder for far less.For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs, I use a mixture of tap water, some chili powder and one egg (left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle), along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion.  So you could possibly not use the egg (attracts some animals, even when rotten) and add a little more pepper, dish soap or baking soda.  You'd end up with something that would work as well as this product.",1345075200,2012-08-16

What's one to do if they don't want the expense, hassle, and space commitment of a smoker?  Well leverage their grill.I've tried various smoker boxes (spoiler alert: they work better than this btw) as well as a few improvisations, and I had high hopes for this.  It had its own sealed (kinda) box, a place for wood chips, and the promise of simplicity.  Well simplicity is a double edged sword, as it lacks any kind of thermometer (no biggie, as many are lacking anyway), limited space (a bit more of a challenge), a lousy grill (well that's a bigger problem), and lastly no real handle for the lid (how did that happen?).  All in all it's not too practical or safe.  It's sad, as it has promise.

2.0,"I'm a gardener and for the last several years I have been practicing the ""art"" of gardening with varying degrees of success.  I buy heirloom seed and raise my seedlings before planting which for me, is fun but still work.  I wanted to try out these seed cups by Miracle-Gro and so far I kind of like them. I won't be changing to these from what I've been doing, but for someone who has a very small area to grow vegetables/herbs or just want a small patio garden I think this is a great way to accomplish that.You won't be raising a large garden with numerous plants of each kind, but you will get a small sampling of some fairly popular vegetable garden plants.  I'm sure the seed used in these seed cups are NOT heirloom, so I wouldn't bother trying to save any to use the following year because they most likely will not produce any vegetables.  Plants yes, but no produce.  And I wouldn't mix them with plants that are heirloom if you're planning on saving any seeds because they will cross pollinate and could sabotage your heirlooms.However, for children, school classroom projects, or the micro gardener I think these are perfect.  They are very easy to plant, I just made a small hole in one of my raised beds and pushed the entire container into it after peeling off the lid. Sprinkle with some water and wait.  It's too early yet to report on the quality of the produce, but so far I have only planted the herbs. I already have a lot of the other type plants growing and don't want to risk cross pollination. I always get excited when I see the new plant babies breaking the surface of the soil - never gets old for me!I'm looking forward to some fresh herbs though, and each seed cup will produce several seedlings.  I don't like to waste seedlings so I carefully separate them and replant.  Most people will choose one or two of the healthiest seedlings and discard the remaining ones, but I like to give everybody a chance if I have the room.  I think these seed cups are an excellent way to introduce gardening to children and for those who just want to start out with something very easy and not much of it.  Some plant food granules are included along with very good instructions.4.19.14 UPDATEThe plant pots I planted never amounted to anything, and this year while getting my raised bed ready for new plantings I found a pot I planted from last year with it's seeds still in it, buried underneath the soil that didn't germinate.  The pot didn't even decay much.  I wouldn't waste my money on these things but buy fresh seeds instead or seedlings that have already been started. I have a few more pots left over and I'll try them again somewhere in the garden, but I'm not expecting them to do anything.",1374796800,2013-07-26
2.0,"The only reason I gave this feeder two stars instead of only one is that I like the glass bottle, much nicer than plastic.  Even at that, the glass is hard to clean unless you have an overpriced feeder ""mop"" or a flexible bottle brush.Despite the advantage of glass over plastic, this feeder is not even useable.  I hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy.  It leaks when the wind blows.  It leaks when the temperature rises.  It leaks just because it feels like leaking.  And that attracts ants, armies of tiny, biting ants.  I've tried filling it to almost the top and I've tried putting just a bit of food in it - doesn't matter, it leaks.Even if that weren't a problem, I still would not like this feeder.  The plastic bottom and the flowers inserted into it are next to impossible to clean.  The flowers have little ridges that cry out to be filled with mold and nasties.  A dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all.  I think the manufacturer is doing the birds a real disservice by selling something that is likely to end up with dirt and mold, and be bad for the birds.So, this product is for the birds.

2.0,"Fiskars badly missed the target on this one.  Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4"" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version.",1367280000,2013-04-30
2.0,"I wanted to see if this grill cover would work well for both our Coleman grill and 17.5 HP Troy-Bilt lawn tractor (since that is what many people use these for).  First I tried it on the lawn tractor.  It covered everything except the wheels just fine, and stayed in place great.  It just fit, so it wouldn't fit a larger tractor.Next, I tried it on the grill.  This is an average-sized, 50"" wide 3-burner grill.  It fit over the top okay, though it didn't quite cover the base.  It was about 1-2"" too short.  Then I tried fastening the velcro straps on each side just under the side shelves to keep it in place.  On one side they fastened fine, but on the other the slightest pull on one and it came right off.  As a test I tried the other also - it came off with only a little more force, a little less than what it takes to tear a sheet of paper out of a spiral notebook.The picture on the product page doesn't match the one I received.  For one thing, it doesn't show the 2 straps on each side, so maybe they were a last minute change; without them the cover can slide around, and might even blow off in windy conditions, esp. on small to medium grills.  The side without the straps is billowing a bit right now outside in moderate wind.  Also, the seams on mine are completely different.  The fabric looks similar, but mine has heat welding seals all along the bottom edge.I pulled the cover out to one side and measured it; it would just barely fit a 60"" wide grill of average depth and height, though it might be a very tight fit.The material itself seems medium-weight, has heat-welded seems and a cloth feel.  It will probably last several years (except for the straps).",1404604800,2014-07-06

In truth it was actually quite a pleasant smell, it smelled of eucalyptus essential oil.

It was VERY flimsy, no matter how long I let it grow it did just not get the thickness that the rest of the grass had. It also would start to die if it didn't receive a lot of water, and we're talking much more water than the rest of the grass, including sod I had down.Every area where this grass was has been replaced with grass from other places in the yard from gardens I dug up this year.

I had to pull it really hard to make it snap back open again and I feel as though this would damage a plant stem. Also, the space left for the stem once snapped together was rather large--I imagine an Asiatic lily stem fitting in it snuggly, but the pepper plants that I grow ever year would probably have too thin of a stem to fit securely.The best thing about this product is that it is green and is made in a leaf design so as not to draw attention to it.

2.0,"This rat trap is designed pretty much like any standard mouse trap. You place the bait on the designated end, you pull the u-shaped bar against the spring and secure it in place with another bar that fits into a little hole on the same piece of metal as the bait. It wasn't too difficult to set up, though the spring is rather tight, and given the size of this thing, you'll want to watch your fingers. I tested it out a few times with a pencil to see how well it might respond to vermin.The first time I tested it, it took a couple of jabs with a pencil to release the bar and have the trap close. But every attempt after that, I had to literally force the bar to move in order to get the trap to go off. And frankly, my opinion is that if the trap is not going off when I'm trying to force it, it's not going to go off for a rat that doesn't have two hands trying to forcefully set it off. I chose not to set it with actual bait and then leave it anywhere because I didn't want it to just attract rodents without actually doing anything about them.

2.0,My original review was a five star. I am dropping it to two and I will explain below.The older Gilmour soaker hoses are excellent if you have one that was made before 2012 HANG ON TO IT AND DON'T LET IT GO.THE HOSES THEY SELL NOW ARE NOT THE QUALITY ONES THEY SOLD ONLY A YEAR OR TWO AGO.I own several of the older hoses. I needed two more. I ordered them and the new is not the same quality as the old. The old ones have two seams and are heavy duty. On the older ones if you had a kink in the line all you had to do was turn the water on and the hose would straighten itself out. Not so with the new ones. Once they are kinked they stay kinked. This is an issue with me because I run mine through cattle panels that I tie my tomato plants to. It's harder for me to get the kinks out in a system like this. It was not an issue with the older hoses.The newer hoses do not water as evenly as the old. Oh they are still a good hose but not nearly as good as they were just a few years ago.I am not sure but I think the price of the new hose is higher than the old. So basically they have reduced their costs by making a lower quality hose and increased their profits even more by charging a higher price. I still need more hoses but they will not be the Gilmour brand. Their short term business practices have lost them a long term customer because I now have to assume that they have probably lowered the quality on all their products.I dislike doing reviews like these. I really like my old Gilmour hoses and originally wrote a glowing review on them. I think that is what irritated me the the most. People may have bought the newer hoses based on my review. I'm glad Amazon lets us edit these reviews even after they are a couple of years old.If Gilmour changes back to selling the old high quality hose I will edit this review again.,1310515200,2011-07-13
2.0,"Three years ago, at the recommendation of a friend, I bought a squirrel-resistant bird feeder (Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic). It worked so well that even the heavier bully birds couldn't feed from it. I have all kinds of birds who feast from this feeder, so I decided I should get a second one. This Perky Pet feeder became available, so I was happy to give it a try. It is much cheaper than my other one, and the difference demonstrates that you do indeed get what you pay for. The squirrels figured out how to get into this one pretty quickly. So did the starlings.This feeder has a nice design, and it looks like it should work just fine. It has a spring mechanism that pulls down the plastic shell over the feeder holes when something heavy sits on one of the perches. Unfortunately, a couple of the feeder holes on this model are high enough that the squirrels just have to hang down from the top of the feeder - without putting weight on a perch - and feast away. I do have this on a tall metal shepherd's hook, so *that* deters many of the squirrels. And I have considered covering up the higher feeder holes to keep the rest of them out. I certainly wouldn't recommend hanging this from a tree or post or anything that squirrels can easily climb. Because of where I placed the feeder, most of the bird seed is actually going to the birds, but it's not because this feeder is squirrel-proof.",1362355200,2013-03-04

2.0,"My first reaction to this product is that it is very expensive for a single unit. But if it works better than the others, perhaps it is worth it. I bought 2 units and plugged them into different locations in the house. After two weeks of testing, they have only caught 2 mosquitoes and 1 small unidentified bug. I have seen fruit flies cruise right past them and there is still a pesky fly buzzing around my house who seems to have no interest in the traps.In addition, the UV light is rather cheaply and flimsily inserted into it's holder so it moves around and causes a loud buzzing noise which requires you to readjust the light from time to time. The buzzing noise is loud, you will hear it if you are in the same room. Finally, this unit is missing an on/off switch so the ony way to turn it off is to unplug it from the wall and find a place to put it which is ackward because of the sticky tape which slides out very easily and the fragility of the UV tube and the fact that it is not terribly secure in the socket.I realize a good trap is hard to come by and none of them are perfect, it could be that this unit is one of the better ones on the market but at $34 a pop, it just doesn't strike me as good value for money. At this time, I cannot recommend it.I'm debating if I should give Flowtron a try, the only thing holding me back is that it is not designed for indoor use which is what I require.",1299369600,2011-03-06
2.0,"Two summers ago I was so excited to get this. I live in a small town in Northern Minnesota, along the North Shore. With Lake Superior in front of us, and the forest behind us, we have no shortage of mosquitoes here. People from Minnesota often joke about how the mosquito is our state bird, because they are so large and abundant here. I couldn't wait to try this Mosquito Magnet out, and assumed I would be emptying the trap of bugs constantly.When it arrived, I sat down with the instructions for putting it together and setting it all up. Everything went together perfectly and when I turned it on I could hear the fan/motor running. I then turned it off, picked up the packing materials and threw them in the trash. About an hour later, I went back outside to our (fenced in) back yard where the Mosquito Magnet was set up and turned it on. Nothing happened. I tested the power cord, it was getting electricity. I was stumped, so I went inside and started reading the handbook that came with the unit, going through the trouble shooting section.After going through every possible fix in the handbook, I went to the Mosquito Magnet website. I thought perhaps there they may have some ideas. I was thrilled to find instructional videos on troubleshooting this very problem. I watched them all, and tried every fix suggested. Nothing worked, so I went in and watched them again to see if there was something I had missed. I tried everything, from clearing the propane lines to getting a brand new tank. I even tried the suggested fix of picking it up (and it's heavy) and shaking it, so that the weights on the inside would be evenly distributed again. I worked on it for days. Then when I gave up, my husband worked on it. When he gave up, my father (someone who can fix just about anything) had a go at it. After my father tinkered with it for a week, he gave it back to me, having no luck. I put it away for the summer, and brought it out again this summer. I found it and decided I needed to ether get it working, or get rid of it. So after fiddling with it all over again, and still having no luck, I've determined it's dead. The motor is the only thing not working. Everything is receiving power and all the lines are clear, with all new equipment attached to it. Unfortunately, it appears the motor only worked for 2 minutes before completely failing. This was very disappointing.",1345420800,2012-08-20

We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.

You paste your peanut butter onto the plate, make sure all the doors are shut tight, and put it near a spot mice frequent (like right outside that Hole in the Wall Bar). If you think the bait has gotten a bit old, you can just wash it out under the faucet and paste some new stuff on.One plus on this trap is that the springs are all inside the trap, so it seems safe enough to leave around pets. Another plus is that there are no chemicals involved, and it definitely looks like it will kill quickly. Our mice seem to be smarter than the average critters, so perhaps we should just swap out the peanut butter for a smear of Guinness froth and catch some leprechauns instead.There is a 30 day warranty with this thing, and you're supposed to see the most mice caught on day 1, so even if this trap disappoints you as much as it did me, you can still get your money back.",1368662400,2013-05-16

2.0,"I was excited to try this out because about a month ago we had a mice problem in our house. I used the Nooski in an area that the mice seemed to love and I also had two snap traps down. I ended up catching 5 mice with the snap traps and none with the Nooski, all using the same bait. We may have also had a misfire once, we're not sure if it was a mouse or something we did.One positive about the Nooski is that it is supposed to be safe for your pets. That's one thing that concerns me with the snap traps and I have to make sure I put them only in places the pets can't get to.I wish this would have worked but we just didn't have any luck with it. The snap traps remain the most effective for us.",1358380800,2013-01-17
2.0,"I've tried a lot of pesticides, and to be honest, most of them aren't very successful. The best luck I've had is with Ortho RosePride Insect, Disease & Mite Control Aerosol, but the scent is so strong you need to wear a mask/eye goggles to spray it (in my opinion) and you cannot safely use it indoors. (As a general aside, the effectiveness of pesticide seems to be directly proportional to how severe the headache you get from the pesticide/scent when you use it.) This left me in a quandary, since my mealy bug/spider mite problem on my indoor citrus and coffee trees was horrible all winter. I did use the Safer product until I ran out of it, and it was initially moderately successful on the spider mites.  It did not, however, work at all on the mealy bugs, and the spider mites seemed to build up resistance to it.  I was left using rubbing alcohol soaked paper towels to scrub each leaf and stem of my indoor coffee, citrus and other plants at least once a month.

2.0,"The design is such that pets and children would have to work to get at the poison.  However, the poison is Bromethalin.  One dose is lethal to rodents, and they die within 24 to 36 hours.  The downside to this is that they may go elsewhere and die, which may be someplace that you do not want a decomposing creature.A persistent dog could chew on this, and it is deadly to dogs (and even more so to cats, but they are less likely to be randomly chewing on plastic, at least from what I have observed!).  There is no antidote, so if you have a rambunctious dog, you might want to consider a snap trap (annoying to a dog, but not lethal).Now, does it work?  In my experience, nope.  I placed these traps along with an electronic trap, and a couple of snap traps along the wall in my garage where I KNOW mice run (we catch about a half dozen a week).  After 10 days I pried the station open (which is not recommended) to be sure the bait had been gnawed.  It had not.I think I would rather go back to my old fashioned snap traps (at least I know where the dead mice are) or my new fangled electrocution chamber (which also kills instantly).I did put it outside now (where if the mice die someplace else I do not have to smell them), and if I see that the bait is taken I will report back.

2.0,"The major reason I wanted to try this product is that we have a strong presence of feral cats, plus raccoons and badgers come out at night as well.  I have a square lot running a little over a quarter acre.  One five-pound container was not enough to cover the entire perimeter, so a week ago, I concentrated it on the two borders where I have seen the cats the most.  No change; I just chased two cats out of the covered area this morning; the product does not seem to bother them at all.  In order to cover the entire exterior perimeter (four-inch wide band) of my lot, I would need 2 and  containers; the label also indicates that one application only lasts up to 30 days, assuming you apply it as directed, only on sunny, dry days.  The annual cost for me to use this product would, therefore, be:  2.5 containers x $27.09 (current cost per container) x 12 months, equals $812.70.

2.0,"The Tomcat spin trap design is meant to be a quick clean way to kill and dispose of mice. You set the trap with bait and wait for a mouse to crawl in the somewhat small opening and get killed when it goes for the bait. These traps will only work with small mice, and the kill mechanism is unreliable as some users have noted - sometimes mice will escape without triggering the trap and sometimes when it does strike them they don't die right away. The one main plus with these for squeamish folks is that when a mouse is caught you just throw the trap away with the mouse inside. Of course that means that you can only catch one mouse per trap and then you would need to buy new traps for the future, similar to the glue traps that are commonly sold. These are safer than other traps if you have kids around, but if you really want a reliable way of catching mice these are likely to disappoint. I have found in my experience with multiple types of rat/mouse traps that I like the electric traps the best for indoor use, and if you have a recurring issue those will end up being more economical in the long run since a single trap could be used for many years.",1402185600,2014-06-08
2.0,"I really wanted this thing to work.  I wanted to see tight little green necklaces around trespassing mice.  But I'm sorry, this thing was in continuous use for over a month, and it didn't do a thing.Yeah, we still got mice.  Little vermin in the attic, under the deck, and in the garage.  They're cute, actually, and I don't really want to kill a living that's doing nothing but what a few million years of evolution has wired it to do to survive--he's just being a mouse, after all--but they're not welcome in my house and I don't want them around.  We've been using glue traps, and they've done okay, catching about one a week in the attic, but not so great for the garage, where there's a lot of dust, and other critters; I accidentally snagged two blue-tailed skinks and a snake this summer.  While I managed to free the snake, both skinks didn't make it, and I still feel bad about that.I like the packaging of this contraption, first of all easy to get into, and not a major garden tool operation to get through the plastic and get the product out and into action--thank you.It's a one-piece thing, that pulls apart into two pieces, the black tunnel (isn't that a thrash metal club in Berlin?) and the semi-clear housing.  The instructions are okay, but Step 1 says simply ""separate the clear tube and the black tunnel.""  There are no instructions on how this is done, nor is there a diagram or anything helpful stamped into the plastic pieces.  There are no mechanical parts, but it still took me a few minutes to discern the nature of the trap and its construction, and figure out how to get these two pieces separated without just yanking and likely breaking something.  Some improved text and diagramming would help with this specific action.The trap's action centers on the green ring, which closes tight around Mickey's neck and chokes him right out.  The packaging notes that the critter dies outside the trap, which makes it nicer for dealing with the trap, resetting it, etc.  There's nothing holding the mouse inside, no mechanical engagement that does him in, no blood.  I like the secondary effect of the mouse lying dead next to the trap, the classic fascist warning to all the others.The packaging says there's no mess, and that's fairly accurate, no squashed or perforated mouse with fluids spewed out.  But you've still gotta pick the sucker up and get him into the trash can.  That's gloves, tongs, or some other implement.  If you're a total miser I guess you could re-use the green ring, but that would necessitate some pretty intense interaction with the mouse carcass--really not worth it.  Yes, Amazon.com does sell the extra green rings, but I note that they were not for sale at my local independent hardware store, nor did I see them at the closest Lowe's.Even if the sucker misfires/fires prematurely, and it did not for me, there's no snap, no threat to your fingers or anything else.  All you have to do is pull the two parts apart, re-roll the green ring back into place, and put the trap back in place, a few seconds of nuisance, but no threat to your digits.  That's an improvement.But did it work?  Well, I put it into action in the garage immediately on receipt, 25 September.  I baited it with peanut butter (Jiffy, smooth), and nothing.  I changed the bait after a week to some crumbled dog chow, which the mice keep coming back for--nothing.  I changed the bait after another week to dog jerky treats--nothing.  I changed the bait after another week to breakfast cereal--nothing, again.  So, after a full month of attempted use, and with four separate types of bait, I had no dead mice to show. In this time a glue trap all of three feet away has caught one mouse.Bottom line: It's been a month since I received this product, and it's been in continuous use since, per the instructions, in a garage where mice are present. In that time this trap has killed no mice.  That's not a good mousetrap.  I rate it at two stars rather than one for the innovative design.",1351123200,2012-10-25
2.0,"I was really hoping this would work! We have a springtime invasion of very tiny black ants. They are particularly attracted to the kitchen sink, probably as a source of water.When they showed up this spring I immediately put out some diatomaceous earth. It didn't stop them so I ordered this Terro product. It's supposed to be fairly safe to use but the instructions said to wear gloves when applying. I didn't own appropriate gloves so I had to buy some. Then I sprinkled the bait around the foundation of the house. It was barely enough.It's supposed to start working in a few days and at first I thought it might be doing something because there seemed to be a decrease in numbers of ants. However, three weeks later we still have ants! Every morning I see a bunch of them in the kitchen sink and on the backsplash, plus a few near the dog's dish and a couple in the bathroom. Today I saw hundreds in the outdoor garbage can even though it stands only a foot from the wall where I applied the bait.This product is borate-based so it is a derivative of boric acid. Boric acid is considered safer than many pesticides, although it still carries risks. According to Wikipedia, it is ""poisonous if taken internally or inhaled in large quantities."" In this ant bait, the borate appears to be coated with something so it is not as likely to be inhaled as plain boric acid powder is. I assume the coating is supposed to be tasty to ants. Perhaps our ants are picky eaters because they are still alive.",1368921600,2013-05-19
2.0,"I have tried two of these hoses at this point....first of all I would like to say that they do indeed work as advertised.

Rumford even includes a carrying pouch so you can store the hose when not in use.I started using these as someone normally would...for light duty yard work, cleaning the deck, etc....nothing major.  The hose was always around a wooden deck or a soil filled flower bed...never near brick or concrete.  The first hose ripped after about 3 weeks and the Rumford after about 4 weeks.  Disappointing.It should be duly noted that I live in a home that has WELL water with very little pressure.  Yes it was enough to expand this hose...but not enough to make it rip apart.Personally I feel that this is a great product that may need a bit more work before I would recommend it.

2.0,"I live in an extremely dry area, so I would think that the birds I feed would welcome water. After over a week, though, I have yet to see any evidence that they are getting a benefit from this. I recognize two parts of the problem but not the full problem.To begin with, the hook on the top of the container will not fit over many hooks or nails, so I had to use some nylon line to hang the waterer. If you buy one, there is a plastic tie that holds on the tag and instructions (if these can be called instructions), and I recommend you don't cut it off as I did. That little tie should be enough.Filling the plastic bottle with water was easy enough, and attaching the base was easy, too. But that's when I noticed the first problem. Very little water actually came out. The next day, when I went to check, the dish from which the birds are supposed to drink was bone dry. So I shook the bottle a bit and induced some water into the dish. The next day, the dish was dry again. Once again, I jiggled the bottle and managed to get a little bit of water into the dish.I've tried screwing the base on more tightly and doing so more loosely, but water simply does not seem to want to leave the bottle and settle in the dish. That's the first part of the problem.The second part is that the base seems just too small for many birds. In the time I have had this, I must have looked at it forty or fifty times. There have been birds galore on the feeder two feet to the right of the water bottle but never a bird on the water tray.I gave it two stars rather than one in deference to those who love it. Perhaps my bottle is just defective in some way. But, having disassembled it and inspected it (thinking perhaps that the plastic hadn't been cut back sufficiently where the water was supposed to come out--not the problem, I discovered), I cannot recommend this product.",1368403200,2013-05-13

3.0,"The havahart live animal cage s easy to set up, sturdy and well built.  It resembles the cage we borrowed from the humane society last year but for the size.  The Havahart trap is smaller to prevent the capture of larger animals.  While I wish some of my neighbors would be more responsible about their pets, I have no desire to trap them.  The smaller openings on this cage prevent such mishaps.I have a small vegetable garden which has been under siege.  I have tried a number of things to prevent mauraders. This is the latest in a series.  Last year we borrowed a trap from our local humane society and frequently awoke to trapped rodents.  I had not been sure what was attacking my garden but it seems the rats were certainly involved.I have not yet caught anything in the Havahart trap, but then I am not hearing them as I usually do.  I suppose time will tell.The trap was easy to set and bait and looks equally as easy to release.  The trap offers one or two door operation.  It comes set up for 2 door use.  For 2 door use, pull back on the spring loaded handle laying it back against the cage.  That pulls the doors open, preparing the trap for use.  Place bait inside on the far side of the pressure sensitive plate. To use with one door simply unhook the cable from the loop on top of the cage and set the same way as for 2 door use.My only qualm, and the reason I gave it 3 stars. is that I wish the carry handle was larger.  I do not like the idea of my hand being that close to a rodent or other wild animal. (The instructions advise use of gloves while carrying a trapped animal.)  The setting handle provides a good deal of clearance from the cage.

3.0,"The ""easy set"" mechanism is finicky. When it works, it is truly ""easy set"". But I have encountered extended periods where I pull down the easy-set handle and the trap refuses to stay set. I have been unable to determine what the difference is (and I am mechanically inclined). What *tends* to work for me during such episodes is to hold the easy-set handle down and use my other hand to lift each of the doors in turn to fully-open: This is only a fraction of an inch higher, but it lets the cables go slack. When I let the doors settle back into position (with the cable taut), this usually fixes the problem, and if not, repeat of this does.Advantages in locating the trap:--------------------------------I use live traps for mice and rats. While one can be reasonably successful setting traps for squirrels and chipmunks in relatively open spaces, my experience has been to be successful with mice and rats, you need to locate the trap in sheltered locations. This poses two basic problems:1). You need to be able either to position the trap without triggering it, or set the trigger with the trap in position. The trigger on the small Havahart traps are so sensitive that they will be set off by even slow movement into position (no sudden changes in direction or speed, no bumps). This model is no exception. However, the Easy-set handle makes it easier than sibling models to reset in a location that is awkward or hard-to-reach.2). There needs to be suitable clearance around the trap for the mechanism to move to release doors. The classic Havahart design has a rod that swings out and up from the side of the trap, requiring too much space to be located behind furniture (such as a couch). On this model, you need very little clearance on the sides, but you do need clearance above the trap for the handle to swing through. This is a potential problem: Years ago, I had rats in my attic and the trap was constantly being triggered without catching anything. I borrowed a surveillance camera and what I saw was that the rats, being cautious, would climb on top of various platforms to look and smell for danger. They used that Havahart live trap as such an observation platform, and while getting on top (before venturing in) they were triggering the trap -- sometimes by bumping the mechanism and sometimes simply by jiggling the trap. Putting something like a single sheet of newspaper over the top of the trap *might* discourage this behavior (It didn't impede the trap springing shut in my experiments).Construction Quality--------------------Excellent. Heavier duty than my earlier model (with which I never had a problem).One issue: There doesn't seem to be a reasonable way to replace the cables (between the doors and the lever) if such should become necessary (each cable terminates inside a part riveted to the door).Issues with baiting the trap----------------------------If you read the instructions and/or watch the videos, there is very little about baiting the trap for mice and rats, yet this is one of the most difficult aspects of setting up this type of trap. With a one-door model, you can put the bait on a tray in the back of the trap (enticing the critter to climb over the trigger plate to get to it). Even this is not simple because the tray tends to spill if you need to maneuver the trap into a hard-to-reach location. With a two-door trap for rats and mice, the only real choice is to suspend the bait above the trigger plate -- this encourages the critter to put its full weight on the trigger plate, to jiggle it, and if this isn't enough, the additional weight of some of the bait falling on the plate can help. My practice is to use tissue paper to create a small bag holding some nuts or sunflower seeds (remember you want a material that lets the smell of the nuts/seeds reach the critters). On some models, I can push a narrow metal rod from one side of the cage to the other just under its top and suspend the bag from it (the rod passes under the string that ties off the top of the bag). I haven't been able to do this with this model because the clearance between the top plate (with the handle) and the cage's mesh is very narrow -- too narrow for any of the rods I have on hand. I have thought of adding a loop on each side to hold the rod up high enough (using wire, string, cable tie,...). However, for my first deployment, I ran string from the bag through the two holes in the top plate. For me, this is unsatisfactory: The bag doesn't hang as high as it would with a rod, and it took too much readjustment to set up. See photo under ""Product Images from Customers"" (not at the top of the page, but to the right of the beginning of the reviews).For a single-door trap, you can temporarily remove the door at the back of the trap to insert and position the bait. With a two-door trap, both doors are spring loaded -- when your hand is inside the trap, the door is pressing down on your forearm. The pressure is annoying but not painful, but it does impede the free movement of your hand inside the trap. One solution is to latch the door in its open position. The manufacturer provides no instructions on how best to do this, or any mechanism to make it easier. What I did was slide a metal rod across the cage just under the door, using the mesh to hold it in place.OK for long-tail critters-------------------------When the doors snap shut, there is a fraction of an inch at the bottom left for the animal's tail. Note: if you trigger an empty trap, momentum takes the door all the way to the bottom, but I stuck various small objects there to confirm that it would crush or hold something similar to a rat's tail (my neighborhood has Dusky-footed Woodrats and their tails are very long -- 150% of body length).Explanation of my rating/my priorities--------------------------------------I down-rated this product primarily because the ""easy set"" mechanism failed to engage too often. I saw the advantage of that mechanism as being better suited for hard-to-reach locations. With earlier models, one often couldn't maneuver the trap into such locations without triggering it, and resetting it in place was difficult/unpleasant. If the easy-set mechanism were reliable, it would have eliminated much of this problem of putting traps in such locations.A lesser part of my down-rating this model was the difficulty noted above about baiting. This review is targeted at a typical consumer, not the professional trapper, and thus *their* ease-of-use is important. Many homeowners are unlikely to have readily available the metal rods I mentioned above. Many will not have the mechanical experience to quickly recognize what should be done. Tiny improvements in the design and instructions could have alleviated this issue.Caveat on ""Live Trapping""-------------------------Note: Many people mistakenly think that live-trapping an animal and releasing it in a distant location is humane. I have been told my knowledgeable people that it typically isn't. If you are releasing an animal in a location suitable for that species, other members of that species have almost certainly claimed it as their territory and will attempt to drive off the intruder, with injury or death (immediate or deferred) for one or both. Consequently, there are often laws against relocation of wild animals (the bottom of the product's instructions advise the purchaser of this possibility, but without explanation).I use live traps to relocate mice and rats from inside my house to my yard immediately outside. The rats occasionally find a way into my attic and after I plug the hole, I use live traps to catch any that might remain in the attic. Also, I get mice in my house when my cat get irritated at being ignored for too long -- he zips out to the yard, grabs a mouse and drops it in the middle of the living room. His notion of ""quality time"" with me is not catching the mouse, but the cooperative chase. Sometimes I catch the mouse, sometimes not. However, I do know where mice like to hide and I leave a live trap there. Aside: Before you say anything negative about my cat's behavior, recognize that his need for ""quality time"" is part of what makes him so lovable.Live traps can be useful in the office as well as the home. I once worked in a building that had an infestation of rats -- they had relocated from an adjacent building that was being torn down after sitting empty for a decade. One morning as I was about to sit down at my desk, I noticed a large snap-wire rat trap where I normally put my feet. I negotiated with the Facilities Dept to let me use a live trap in my office area (and save my toes).-- Douglas B. Moran",1398988800,2014-05-02

3.0,"(This is the title of my country song about that mole.  Don't steal it.)I'm willing to do a lot to get rid of the mole that ate hundreds of my flower bulbs.  There were lilies and tulips and daisies - it was a joyful spring cellebration.  And then one sad spring morning, I saw there was not a single bulb left.  I looked across the driveway and I swear I heard that mole burp.I have tried multiple methods of killing this mole, including the deadliest of poisons, a one-trick dog, sitting on a chair in my field with a shovel in my hand waiting for him to make one move, just one move, and two prior kinds of mole traps, guaranteed to work by a landscaper friend.This one was much easier to use than some of the traps that could take a finger off (or nose, if you're looking at it while you set it).But still, that nasty little thing lives.  One of these days, I'm going to sit in my chair in the garden with aDouble Shot Rifle Double Barrelinstead of a shovel.  And yes, I have read the township ordinances.  I may not be allowed to have a chicken but I can shoot a varmint.I'll let you know when the situation ends. We're still in a standoff.",1376697600,2013-08-17
3.0,"This arrived decently packed and intact despite some delicate parts.  The feeder has a brass finish but is made out of very lightweight materials - it looks good from a distance but the lack of quality is apparent once you have it up close.We have VERY smart squirrels in our area - and they are quite territorial and eager to feast on the bird feeder seeds.  In fact, they feast on everything - from Halloween pumpkins to anything we try to put in the garden.  Nothing survives our plague of squirrels.I was skeptical of this feeder due to it having a plastic barrier.  The squirrels here chew through everything so plastic isn't going to stop them (as I found with my garden vegetables and various covers I used to protect the veggies).  So I know this isn't going to last very long as a bird feeder.  On the plus side, perhaps the seeds will keep the squirrels out of the vegetables (and not eat my son's halloween pumpkin before it even gets to be used for halloween).Interesting concept but needs a little more development.",1364515200,2013-03-29

3.0,"Living in southeast USA I have problems with these subterranean critters and I have use similar traps that was more effective. Sweeney's 9015 Deadset Precision Mole Trap is fairly well made but it has a lot of plastic. The other mole traps were made of all steel and was easier to use. I'm afraid that I will break the plastic prongs that I push into the ground. I didn't have to worry with the older and smaller mole steel traps.I like it ok but it's difficult to use. Although dangerous, I prefer to dray fumes into the mole hills. I have used gasoline but now I use mole gas that I find at my local Farmers Supply store. It is quicker and moe efficient than a one kill device. I have also used mole or rodent poison pellets. This product is practically useless if you have a large infestation because it will only get one mole per time if you're lucky. If you have a small mole problem, I can see how this could work.",1375747200,2013-08-06
3.0,"This feeder holds a lot of seeds, enough for a couple of days here. I've watched most every variety of birds who are so inclined to dine on the feed I use ( a common brand and variety) come to the feeder. From the Cardinals to the Nuthatches, none have reported any problems with perching or reaching the seed. I've even seen a Mourning Dove helping herself...albeit she was sitting sideways! The feeder is metal and heavy plastic. It's actually two feeders, one up, one down. Easy to fill. Steel multi-stranded wire to hold the feeder to the hanger and the nut on the top easily slides up to open the seed compartments. There's a pressure button that releases the nut to slide. It holds the dome top securely in place. Simple. A neutral bronze color. I don't know if the other visitors will be thwarted by the dome type top, it hasn't delayed the raccoon from helping himself, lol. The birds like it, I like it, it's sturdy, attractive, I recommend it.**Update - June 4, 2013: I must update my original review, a drop of two stars because: The steel cable that supports the feeder, while very strong, is coated with plastic to keep it from rusting. The sliding nut at the top that you press the release button and slide up to open the feeder has come apart and has made a wad of plastic about one inch from the top of the feeder bell. This means the slider nut will not slide past it, making it almost impossible to fill. I intend on removing the plastic coating with a knife, but anticipate that the result will be an easy slider, but a rusty then rusted through, cable. YES, I depressed the button to clear the cable. It worked fine for a few refills, but then after the plastic tore and wadded up, it doesn't work. It's still a good feeder, the birds like it.",1369267200,2013-05-23
3.0,"Let me start by saying some positives about these planters. First, I was surprised at how big they were. Guess I couldn't tell from the pictures their size. The larger one could easily plant a small tree in (i.e. if you were in the south, you could plant a small orange tree). Second, they were heavier and sturdier than I anticipated (no fear in leaving it on the patio and having it blow over). What I didn't care for it was the color first (a super drab grey), the feel of the pot (some kind of a metallic) and most importantly the fact that there is no drainage in the bottom (not good for root rot). I planted a rose bush in the large one to put out on my outside patio. Given that I don't have any kind of drill to make a hole in it, I am just hoping that the watering I am doing will not collect on the inside of the planter to harm the plant (I have several inches of potting soil beneath the roots and the bottom of the planter). I am sure, if I were handier or if I was more of a horticulturist I could have figured out how to solve this dilemma.Follow up 06-04-2011: Well, the inevitable happened. Without drainage holes in this, my rose bush died last year. There was so much collected water in the bottom (from rain) that although you couldn't see it from the top, the roots goet all rotted. The planter sat in my garage over the winter. Last weekend, a friend drilled five holes in the bottom of the planter for me and I replanted (this time with a large tomato plant). I will let everyone know how it goes. If I had the opportunity, I would have changed the rating of this to 1 or 2 stars for the aggravation and death of my rose bush. Never saw a planter that was set up like this before, really bad design. These are not cheap either, but honestly they are not worth the money at all.",1242777600,2009-05-20
3.0,"First the pros - it's very a compact hose with a small footprint when dry/collapsed, the brass fittings seem to be sturdy and connected easily to my house and it's lightweight/easy to move around. For the cons - you need to follow the directions for it to work properly, the water pressure is disappointing and it is rather fragile when compared to a 'normal' hose. I've found it's better for watering plants and washing the car rather than for running a sprinkler or connecting to the pressure washer. Overall, I can see the promise in the idea but most of our water usage outside requires a bit more ooomph, so I see us sticking with a more traditional hose for now.",1400025600,2014-05-14
3.0,"From fresh water to pressure washing gear, I've probably used just about every Swan hose that was ever made. For the most part overall quality has been good. If there was a weakness to any of their products it was the couplings on their cheaper hoses. I haven't had that problem in recent years. Swan makes almost every American made hose out there. That includes this Scott MaxFlex hose. So it was a no brainer to take this one for a test run. After four weeks use these are my thoughts.Timing was perfect. I was going to replace my older camping hose anyway. Measuring in at 5/8"" x 50' and weighing a little over seven pounds this Scott version is lighter then my older hose. I'm alright with that. The lead free aluminum couplings are not new features by any means. Most of Swan's hoses have been outfitted with these for quite some time. Still it works. I like the re-enforced vinyl covering. Unlike the cheap imported knock offs, its first rate and won't fray or peel. I can even live with the yellow line.On my first real test I laid the hose out to the max. I ran water through it a couple of times and drained it. Unfortunately the lay flat technology didn't show up. Even with the hose filled with water it still has a tendency to kink. For fresh water use its treated with bacteria and mold inhibitors. Still nothing gets rid of the taste of a new hose except constant use. I broke out this hose on several occasions since my initial test. Same kinking problem. For me personally I find this hose to be an average tool for camping or light gardening.The couplings on this product are first rate and definitely the best part of this hose. Still, this hose is too light for heavy duty use. Besides the constant kinking, a big ping against this particular product is the price tag for a 50' light duty hose. Its way overpriced for what it does not provide.",1393977600,2014-03-05

They are placed high where the birds can see them but I cannot get up there to change their position, so maybe that is my fault. The others have heads that move in the wind but they do not move now so this is an effort to get a head moving. These all need ballast so you need some gravel or sand to fill in the bottom; they need weight as these are hollow and light and the wind will blow them away. I think it is a nice, natural, way to attempt to discourage bad birds; better than a BB or pellet gun.

3.0,"I had high hopes for this product and tried it on vinyl and wood siding and a wood deck. My first disappointment was in the amount of effort it takes just to prepare your chosen surface prior to using the product. I had minimal foliage to be concerned with but if I had, the directions gave even more prep instructions for plants and flowers. In any case, For the vinyl and wood siding surfaces, I followed the instructions and used the Krud Kutter on half of each structure and plain water on the other half. While I did see a slight difference where the Krud Kutter was applied, it wasn't enough to make me want to use it again when the time came to clean my deck. By then, it just wasn't worth the effort for such minimal results. Granted, the sidings and deck probably haven't been properly cleaned in years so perhaps I was just expecting too much. But given the amount of prep work involved - like pre-wetting each surface - this would have to produce some amazing results for me to want to put that much extra effort into pressure cleaning with anything more than just plain water.

3.0,"Not terribly offensive, and doesn't appear to harm anything I sprayed it on.  It's only been a few days though, so I can't really comment on that, nor on the efficacy of their proprietary SPOREX formulation.What I can say is that the pressure washer (thus, just plain water) does the lion's share of the work.  I call into question their claim that pre-soaking or pre-spraying isn't necessary.  Maybe not on materials you can just hammer-down on them with the pressure washer, but for wood, etc. the product didn't seem to do much more than plain high-pressure water.  Pre-soaking might have helped, but that doesn't abide the directions on the bottle.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences.At least it doesn't smell like Montana Solvent, and is certified to be greener than the stuff I've used in the past.  Some of the cleaners of olden days would about eat through your sneakers.  They would definitely kill vegetation whether you rinsed them down or not.  All in all, if I were doing another deck, coated in mildew and leaf stains, I think I would just cover my plants, dillute a little Clorox and cry 'Havoc'.This stuff seemed to be mostly about peace of mind, with not much cleaning.  My guess is there was moderate, incremental improvement in cleaning, but it wasn't astonishing.  I wish it were otherwise, but I can't endorse this product further than to say it might mildly improve your cleaning job, with the pressure washer still doing all the heavy lifting.",1401926400,2014-06-05

I was hopeful that many of the seemingly obvious design problems in the original had been addressed, but sadly, this sequel is more of the same.In fact, the only thing that's really notable over its predecessor, is that this works out of the box (the original needed to be left outside for a day or two to charge). Other than that, the top still inexplicably pops off of the base, getting any sort of accuracy out of the spray head is a bridge too far, and the tank empties out much faster than expected.Where it does excel, intentionally or not, is that the noise of the activated sprinkler is enough to scare animals away before a drop of water hits fur.

Also, sometimes, mice do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the mouse in it. Traps in general are a hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can't get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don't want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead mouse, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped mouse.",1404604800,2014-07-06

The aphids, scale, whitefly and other crud that lives on my lemon tree seemed to be pretty much unaffected.  The only thing I think will really help that poor tree is a chainsaw.  And a bonfire.4.

We live in a climate that gets below freezing for a few months every winter and it normally takes until late spring for anything to really get up to speed.  I had visions of planting these cute little pots in a sunny window and transplanting them outside when the weather was right.All in all, it's a neat kit, with fertilizer, seeds and a peat pot for each.  After removing the kit, you simply peel the label off the top, pick a nice spot and water.  Of the 18 seed pods, I had good results with 15 of them. Not bad odds really, and the ones that did sprout are doing pretty well right now.  It's a whole lot of packaging for 18 tiny pods though.  We've done starts before with peat pots from the garden store and had just as much luck with those.  I think if you used a soil with fertilizer, it might be better to start them that way at less than half and probably more like a quarter the price of this kit.  This saves getting your hands dirty digging in the soil bag, which really is most of the fun to me.All in all, it's a neat idea.  Peel a label, pop it in the ground, water and wait.  I think it'd make a great gift or a good starter for someone just dipping their toes into gardening.

4.0,"I own two of these classics, and have for some time.  Let me tell you right off that unlike a lot of squirrel baffles that can cost as much as this entire feeder, this squirrel buster really does work.  The internal spring action system immediately closes the wire cage surrounding the feeder when a squirrel, (or anything else similarly weighted), attaches itself to it.  As anyone that is at war with squirrels in the bird feeding business knows, squirrels don't give up easily when trying to get at your bird seed.  They have spent hour after hour crawling all over this thing trying to get at the seed somehow, but so far I have never seen any varmint beat it.  The top of this unit is rounded, and the wire hanger is long, thus preventing the foothold at the top that is the Achilles heal of so many baffles and so called squirrel proof feeders.  The squirrels will definitely test every inch of this model, and as such will keep your birds away until the entire community of them is satisfied that there is no way in.  But eventually they give up and drop to the ground, and your feeder is now open for business for the clientele you intend it for.Now for the minuses.  Despite the effectiveness of this unit, it still has a cheap feel to it inside.  The actual tube that holds the seed is made of a very thin and light flexible plastic that will eventually come to be the first place this thing comes to fail you.  It will dry up and crack when used in places of extreme weather variations, (like in New England where I am).  My Busters are both over 3 years old and still working well, but the plastic tube is definitely drying out and wearing.  I would put the life expectancy of this feeder at sometime under 5 years.  Either reasonable or disappointing depending on your track record with other feeders. Also, I am not at all a fan of the wire hanger is uses.  If this hanger breaks or fails in any way, it would be difficult to replace, and also its design would make improvising something hard to manage as well.  To really distract squirrels from finding a foothold to hang from the top the wire hangs very long, so expect to adjust your present hanger or pole if you like it at the present level.  (It's important to keep it high enough off the ground to keep it away from jumping squirrels, and of course cats).In conclusion, the price of this model is most reasonable when compared to the very effective, but ghastly overpriced Yankee Flipper. It's easy to operate, easy to take apart and clean, and durable enough to last for about 5 years or so.  And lastly, it does what it says it does, disappoint your community of squirrels big time.  Despite its couple of flaws, I recommend it.  Enjoy...",1305072000,2011-05-11
4.0,"We have a fairly small front yard and no other grass, so we were able to mow it with half a charge. Some reviewers claim to have no problems doing a half-acre yard and others say they can't finish a 1/3rd-acre yard. If I had a half-acre yard, I would get a gas mower.

Also, stopping in the middle of mowing to change batteries sounds like a big nuisance.I don't think this mower has any overwhelming advantages over the latest gas mowers.

Anyone who is having problems with the mulching may not be setting the height up enough. It shows on the mower that a setting of 4+ inches is required for the mulching to work right.We checked under the mower when done cutting and there was no grass build-up at all under it.Negatives:It is not as quiet as I was expecting it to be, but it is much quieter than our old gas mower.Either the handle or the part it attaches to was bent so the left side of the handle does not fit flush, but it's close enough to work.It came with a tear in the foam around the handle.As others have said, the slowest speed setting is still as fast as we would want to go, so the faster speeds are wasted. B&D; should adjust this, but it still works for us. When turning to go back at the edge of a lawn, if you let go of the self-propel control, it can be hard to maneuver and if you don't let go, it wants to whip you around.The directions were very confusing. For example the self-propelled model has two ""bales"" (wires above and below the handle) - one to control the blade and one to control the wheels. Yet the instructions keep referring to ""the bale"" without saying which one.",1402012800,2014-06-06
4.0,"I have had this feeder about 6 weeks now and made several observations:1. It is well made, sturdy, tough, all metal zinc plated steel and will likely be very durable.2. Large capacity - holds 2.5 pounds black oil sunflower seeds requiring fewer refills.3. Easy to refill through large door on the top, without taking the feeder down.4. Cover or roof on top offers some protection from the rain (if it's not blowing).5. So far, not getting as much attention or use from the birds as my other feeders  but of course the birds are accustomed to the older feeders.6. Some reviewers complain the openings in the mesh are too small and birds can't get the seed out.  I am undecided about this but I doubt it is the case because if you shake the feeder some seed will fall out and through the mesh onto the platform.  I can say for sure there is less waste due to spillage of sunflower seeds compared to my other feeders- a big plus.7. I only wish it was available in a selection of colors.  I would prefer a more natural less gaudy color such as dark green, brown or black.  For me, the show is not the feeder, the show is the birds.",1402012800,2014-06-06

4.0,"Summary:  A small, compact pressure washer that is fine for occasional use.  Two heads allow either a rapid spinning needle spray, or a variable wide to needle pattern.Pros:  Compact, easy to use, good quality.  The handle is comfortable, and the pressure is perfect for the casual exterior cleaning I do.  If I need to do a deep cleaning, I'd rent a 3,000+ pound sprayer, as this is not designed for hard to clean jobs.  The power cord is long (25 feet, I think) and the hose is about 10 feet long.  So it reaches around the house from the power outlets fairly well.Cons: The hook-up for the water is plastic.  This can be changed out for Brass, which I did.I'd buy it again.

This is for alerting you to a problem before it becomes severe, so you can take action to get rid of the larvae before they do too much damage. Methods to get rid of the larvae include washing, freezing the clothes for a week, steam cleaning, and/or chemicals.If you're looking for an alert to a potential problem, this is a decent product to have.

4.0,"This is a very well made brush that is good for feeder ports, especially hummingbird feeders.  So far for me it's been tough enough that after several uses its still holding its shape, and without shedding.  I like it and feel it is well worth the price here on Amazon, (especially with the free shipping that is being offered at the time of this writing).  The only thing I feel I should make extra note of is its really small size.  It's only 3 1/2"" long, which makes it kinda useless for anything but ports on feeders.  If you want to get down to the bottom of a tube feeder where it really gets nasty over time, you will need to pick up a long bottle brush.  Also, if you do buy this brush for use on feeder ports, I would toss the suggestion of keeping it around your sink for other uses that's mentioned in the description.  You will be bringing in all kinds of bacteria from dirty feeders into your kitchen.  You can wash it well of course, but it's still a better idea to either keep one of these strictly for other uses than feeders, or buy some other brush for your kitchen sink.

4.0,"I'll be honest:  I don't really like giving products 5 stars unless I really think they stand far above the competition and/or I can see that its doing a fantastic job.  The problem with this Deer Off is that I'm not completely sure if deer are avoiding some plants because they've been sprayed with it, or because...well, it's summer in the pacific northwest and everywhere you look there's plenty of OTHER green things to eat.Giving it the benefit of the doubt:  deer haven't eaten the plants sprayed with this stuff.But be weary:  the deer haven't eaten nearby plants that haven't been sprayed with this stuff, either.On the other hand:  my property has 4 deer living in the ""back 40"" that routinely like to snack on everything.  there are, without a doubt, deer nearby.At any rate, if you're buying this concentrated stuff, but sure to:1.  Buy a sprayer of some sort.  You need it to apply this stuff.2.  Plug your nose when mixing.  Rotten eggs and hot peppers are the ingredients, and it smells like it.3.  After mixing into the sprayer that you buy, shake it up well, otherwise you'll get little blobs of congealed...something...that'll clog the nozzle.So far, I'd recommend this stuff, but as fall and winter sets in (and the green goes away), we'll see if the deer will decide that they enjoy the spicy version of my plants.",1375920000,2013-08-08
4.0,"This mouse trap is easy to set, bait, and includes suggested directions for placement.  After catching the mouse, the trap can be emptied and reset or can be disposed.",1365638400,2013-04-11
4.0,"This product works as advertised.  It will catch/kill a mouse about as effectively as a standard ""snap"" mousetrap.  They both use the same principles: bait it with peanut butter, set it, and catch the mouse.The advantage this has over a typical mousetrap is that you do not have to view the ""execution"" and can just cleanly toss away the whole unit afterward.  Another advantage over a standard mousetrap is that, since it is all enclosed, you need not worry about your dog, cat, etc. hurting themselves on the trap.The downside to this is it can become fairly expensive.  If you are going to keep these in a garage, basement, etc. just as a precaution, that's one thing.  But if you get mice in the house, typically a field/house mouse is going to have a nest of 10-20 who come to visit you.  That would be a lot of these disposable traps, and at more than $4 a pop it'll add up quickly.As far as performance, this is about as effective as a regular bait mouse trap.  Some reviews have commented on its failure and small opening.  My opinion is as follows:There are times when a mouse will eat the peanut butter bait, but not trip the trap, or manage to dodge it.  That goes for standard snap traps as well as this one.  I have used the black plastic Tom Cat mouse traps in the past and found they work well.  But even with those, I'd say about 1 out of 10 or 15 times I'd return to find no peanut butter and the trap either untripped or unoccupied.  If you are looking for 100%, you can go with a chemical trap, but that comes with a whole other suite of issues.....pets, dead mice in your walls, etc.With a snap trap, enclosed or not, accept that once in a while the mouse will dine for free at the trap, but you'll get him the next day.As for size, the opening is about 1 inch on this Victor trap.  Small to you and me, but ample for a mouse.I have used these in my garage to intercept visitors before they make their way into my house.  They work fine.  I happen to prefer the standard traps.  There is usually very little clean-up, and standard ""snap"" traps are reusable (depending on the mess they made), where this is meant as a one-shot deal.  Even if you dispose of the snap traps, they still cost less than half this enclosed unit.So I would say, if you simply do not want to deal with seeing your rodent victim, or just want to lay a trap or two as a precaution, this product would be for you.  However, if you are trying to get rid of a nest, a standard snap trap will work just as well but cost much less.",1286841600,2010-10-12

It also has a lot of flexibility in the size of the brackets to adjust to different railings or fences.I tried this flower pot holder out in a couple of places before I found one that had the best sunlight and water possibilities - morning sun and only partial cover by a porch roof.  Then I decided on a great kindness to the plant, a vine that doesn't like trouble, and I put it on the side of the fence that faces my husband's garden instead of mine.  His side has about 90% better chance (okay, 100%) of being watered in a timely manner.  I have the general attitude that if plants are meant to live, they will -- except during the drought, and then even I showed better sense than that.The only thing I could have wished from this would be for a little more depth.

4.0,"This is my first-ever pair of pruning shears so I have no way to compare them with other pruners.  Having never used a pruner before, I wished it would have come with more directions than it did; for instance, I had no idea which side of the blade to hold ""upwards"" for the best cutting leverage, and it says the blade tension is adjustable, but I have no idea how to adjust it.  It does have a diagram on blade replacement on the card (but no part number listed for the replacement blades).I ordered this to help with trimming down a burning bush that had grown all the way up to the soffit and gutters and had grown completely out of control.  Then for cutting the branches up so they would fit in my trash cart.  It worked great for that.Kind of hard to tell the size here from the picture, they are about 11"" long.  The description says they are good for up to 1 inch in diameter.  Maybe I'm just not strong enough, but I had to use a small hand saw to cut through the wooden branches that were an inch thick.  I tried at first using the pruners with a two-handed method for more cutting strength, however I was afraid I'd break the pruner.  Even though these come with a great full lifetime warranty, I didn't want to chance breaking them by stressing them out too much.  Maybe I would have done better with a ratcheting pruner, but as long as these made my job easier, I'm happy.So I used the hand saw on my large branches that were basically old wood and for anything more green and soft, "" and under, the pruners worked fine.  Being ergonomically correct, they are comfortable in the hand, and went through the smaller branches like a hot knife cuts through butter.After pricing some locally, you can't go wrong buying your pruners here at Amazon.",1288569600,2010-11-01
4.0,"Used to see so many of these type replacement trimmer units sold on TV and always figured they were junk.Now they all seem to be gone from the marketplace except for two types that I found, I bought this one because it uses plain heavy duty .095 trimmer line and not special made blades that might be hard to find at some point.This can be set up to use 2 or 4 sections of line (bent double to be 4 or 8) I've been using it with only 2(4) so far and it works at least as well as my old stock unit that kept needing repairs and wasting line.Cutting pretty well, but makes the engine seem to run a bit slower and I feel the need to give it more throttle.I might try it with all 4 lines at some point to see if there is an improvement in cut, but happy as is and saves line too. (8 lines in use after you fold them over and insert) not sure what all 4(8) lines will do to the RPM range however, might not let my engine come up to full speed.This same item is also sold under the ""Rino-Tuff"" brand, but made by the same company.Check the pre cut replacement string package, for just a dollar or so more you can get 100ft of .095 line and cut 100 pcs pretty quick.Was quick and easy to install and has given no trouble so far with a few hours of cutting with it. (still the same line that came with the unit)They claim 20x the life for the line, but who knows.. even if it gets the same life per foot as the old coil loaded in, it's still easier to deal with no mechanical parts and uses low cost rolls of line.On the subject of line life, one thing to keep in mind is that when you do wear line it is not replaced by more from a spool so just gets shorter and shorter.. how long will you keep using it at it's shortest length before you put in new line?  A variable that will cause owners to report different findings on line wear times I'm sure.Claims to fit 99% of the gas trimmers out there, but no way one person can know if this is true.  Does come with a good assorment of sizes for nuts and bolts to fit what you have though.No way to know how this will hold up, but time will tell and I'll be back to say if it didn't do well 8-)NOTE;  Be sure to read the comments attached to this review before you buy",1251417600,2009-08-28
4.0,"I think any experienced bird feeding hobbyist could take one look at this feeder and realize it is not squirrel proof, so I'm really not rating it on that aspect.  The cap on which the squirrel-proof claim rests has so far kept squirrels from going in through the top, but only because it's easy enough to access the seed from the feeding ports that they haven't bothered to try lifting the lid.  They can only get a little bit at a time, but my squirrels are oh-so patient and are content taking as long as necessary to empty a feeder.However, I have a more accessible hopper style feeder nearby of which the squirrels are big fans, so I am able to use this one with a fair amount of success.  The birds really do seem to like the U-shaped perches better than the straight perches on my actually squirrel-proof feeders (Brome 1024 Squirrel Buster Plusand Brome's similar peanut feeder), and this feeder is hands-down more attractive.  For twenty bucks it is not, of course, actually made of antique copper, but it does give the appearance and is a pretty yard decoration.  Time will tell whether the copper finish will age nicely, and I have low expectations for the plastic windows which, in my experience, take about one season to become scratched and cloudy.  For now, though, I am enjoying this feeder a lot and the price is reasonable enough that it won't break my heart if it doesn't hold its looks for multiple seasons.  It is sturdy and I expect it will continue to work, so I'll just move it to a less visible spot in the yard if that happens.",1368316800,2013-05-12

4.0,"A few short years ago I was happily ensconced in the Midwest. Trips between towns would afford the occasional glimpse of deer; sometimes we would be lucky enough to catch sight of a bambi or a stag. Imagine our joy when, upon moving to the northeast, we were visited by a herd of deer the first night in our new home. The deer were daily visitors all through the long winter. How lucky for us! Of course we knew that come spring and summer our deer friends would retreat into the deeper forest and, naturally, we would be bereft.Well, spring came, and with it a pestilence of deer. Large deer, small deer, rutting bucks chasing females in heat - a cornucopia of strong footed, long limbed voraciously hungry vermin! Nothing would deter them from feasting on my flowerbeds. Deer repellant sprays would work until the first gentle rain fell in the night. Come morning my hostas were reduced to stubble. Pepper solutions were apparently considered seasoning. Coyote urine? You think they fell for that? Nothing worked.We finally installed a fence and, to the kids delight, got a dog. Both have helped considerably. (Yes, some of them do jump over the fence and would probably eat the pup if they could open their jaws wide enough.) That said, the front yard is still open for grazing. I was pretty sure these deer repellant sticks would prove themselves unattractive yard ornamentation. The only action I foresaw was some high hilarity when I managed to back into them weeding. I have to admit these ugly sticks admirably impress me. We have a Japanese maple tree out front that has long been considered delectable deer cuisine by the marauding herds. We placed one pole to the front of it and then positioned the other two poles along the path leading to the front area. (Yes, our house is situated smack dab in the middle of what appears to be a long-standing deer path.) To date, the maple tree has remained unmolested. Now, full disclosure, I am still using the deer repellant spray. That said, we have had some terrific rains for days on end and I did not reapply the spray, so it would seem that the poles are helping.If the poles cease to be effective or if I am fortunate enough to actually see a deer get zapped I will update this review.",1307923200,2011-06-13

However once these catch the flavor is right on.,1400112000,2014-05-15
4.0,It's long enough to reach the back of the grill.  Fairly stiff.  For heavy stuff I think I shall need a bladed scraper.  The bristles do not come out and leave dangerous bits on the grate.  Knocks off the easy stuff.,1383177600,2013-10-31

5.0,"I have a smallish backyard garden (five raised beds, each 4x12') and, for me, weeding is the least fun part of gardening. Over the past few years I've begun using black plastic sheeting as a mulch to cover the beds and I'm a complete convert: black plastic mulch heats the soil, retains moisture and, most importantly, it makes weeding a thing of the past, except... Except that when it comes to certain crops, like onions, it's really not efficient. It's simply too big a chore to cut slits for 200-300 baby onion plants and even if you do, weeds will grow up *right next* to the onion plant. Last year I had a horrific weeding problem in my onion bed (I devoted one 4x12' bed to just onions); some awful insidious grasses just took over and made weeding a torturous chore and kept the size of the yield to a bare minimum. Weeds robbed all of the nitrogen and other nutrients in the soil and really stunted the growth.I decided this year to try a pre-emergent weed killer, but being the organic sort of person I am, I certainly wasn't going to pump Preen or some other awful crap into my food beds. I'd been reading about the benefits of corn gluten meal (though there is considerable online debate about its effectiveness) and decided this was the year I would try it. What the heck; if it works, a miracle, if not, I'm not worse off than last year (and next year I'd have to figure out a way to use the plastic with onions). Then the Amazon Vine Program offered me, like a miracle, a bag of this corn gluten meal. Perfect timing. So last week I took what was a strawberry bed for the past few years, dug up all the strawberry plants, churned in 120 lbs of composted manure and let it sit for a few days. Then I added this corn gluten meal and raked it in and watered it gently per the instructions. Interestingly, I had read many times that timing is everything with corn gluten and that the best time to put it into the soil is just as the forsythia are budding--and that's just what I did (I'm in zone 6 in Connecticut). I'm letting the corn sit for a few days before I plant the onion plants. By the way, you can't use this product with seeds because obviously it will not allow them to ""emerge."" It is *only* useful with seedlings and the bag says it's perfectly safe for seedlings.Of course, I can't yet tell you if it works or not because it's not warm enough for the weeds to really be kicking in. But I'm following the instructions carefully, have done everything I think is required and now I'm just waiting. (There are time constraints on Vine reviews otherwise I would have waited to post this.) But I *will* update this in about two weeks (early May) to see if it really is controlling weeds. I'm kind of excited to see if this works, because if it does, I may use it in other beds and stop buying as much plastic. I don't mind using the plastic, but again, for some crops, it's quite a pain. So, update coming soon. I hope this works!Update 4/27: OK, about a week, so far no signs of weeds. But I planted 200 onions today, so fingers crossed.Update 5/02: Kind of impressed. Still don't see a sign of a weed in that onion bed. Could this stuff possibly work?Update 5/14: This is pretty amazing--a few big rainy days, lots of hot days and not a week in sight! Wow.",1366070400,2013-04-16
5.0,"I set this up by myself with relative ease (I am a petite woman who is very skilled at finding ways to hurt myself at every turn).  Two D batteries are required & NOT included so make sure you have them!I didn't expect this to cover too much area so the first time I set it up I chose a small section in front of my home.  When I discovered I still had nearly a full spool of wire I decided to go all out & try to go around my entire home.  I pulled everything up & started over.Using 2 rows of wire I almost made it around my home.  About 1/2 of one side of the home is only protected by one row.  Note:  I live in a very small house.  I doubt there is enough fencing to go around a small average sized ranch house.  It might be possible if you use only one strand of wire but with only one strand, it's not likely to be very effective at keeping the critters out.I used a medium sized rubber mallet to pound the little plastic stakes into the ground.  A screw driver was sufficient for tightening the wire where needed.  I also used the mallet for the ground pole but a hammer would have been the better choice.I am using this fencing to keep my flock of endangered geese away from the house.  They love to park themselves beak first pretty much touching the doors & they poop mountains.  No joke.  It's terrible.  When I first turned on the fence my spirits sank because the chickens & barn cats were darting back & forth through the fence like it was nothing.  I checked to see if the fence had power with the little fence checker included & yep, working!  Also the charger flashes but it is hard to see in the daylight.  I realized that I could hear it working & now that's how I check to see if the batteries are still good.  Just listen for the humming clicking sound.So far not one goose has crossed the fence(I added non electric fencing on the section that is only one strand)!  I am so thrilled!  I have one strand low to the ground & one about midway.  It is low enough that I can easily step over it.  This means I don't need a gate.  Remember, you don't want the electrified wire to touch the ground!After a good drenching rain I noticed the chickens & the cats were very cautious of the fence & none dared to touch it.  I guess with them being wet they are noticing the shock a bit more!This fence is doing exactly what I'd hoped for.  I'm very very happy with it!",1351468800,2012-10-29

5.0,"Received this as tree pruner as a Christmas gift and have used regularly over the past nine months, so feel that I know this tool very well now.We have about one acre of land in a subdivision, and two-thirds of that area is wooded (and a creek runs down through the woods). The wood line is full of old hardwood trees, new volunteers and tons of shrubbery -- so there's always a hefty amount of maintenance to be done.The first thing we did when Spring rolled around was to break out this tool and trim many of the low-hanging limbs to a level that would allow me to safely mow along the tree line again. Our 14 year old son was helping, and our first impression was WOW! the pruning saw blade is very, very sharp and easy to use. Without that saw our job would have taken weeks instead of a couple days!At the same time we noticed something that other reviewers have knocked this pruner for -- the telescoping handle tended to slip from time to time, always at the most inopportune time (like when the blade was 12 feet up in mid-slice of a limb). However, this was an easy problem for us to solve... we just trekked back to the tool box and found the right size socket wrench, then tightened the two bolts on the locking mechanism until the slipping stopped. Tightening involved a bit of trial & error work, we tightened them too much at the onset but got the tension just right within a couple of minutes.Sawing limbs with this thing is a fast and easy job; just make sure that you are sawing on as much of a horizontal plane as you can and it will go right on through like cutting butter. Do not recommend sawing with the blade in a vertical position, like when standing just under the limb, as this makes it both difficult and dangerous for you.Cutting smaller limbs with the pruner was just as easy too, and the leverage provided by rope & pulley system is amazing. Very little effort is needed as long as you have the limb properly perpendicularly lined up and as long as the limb is not too large for the shear.Had not problem with the nylon rope; yes, it has some stretch but the handle is made to slide along the rope and can be set wherever you need it to take up any slack. Good design and easy to use.Bottom line: One of nicest yard work related gifts I have received and it gets a lot of use. Recommended  if you are looking for a tree pruner like this one and have the patience to make a couple tweaks to it along the way.",1378598400,2013-09-08

5.0,"I've gone through the usually assortment of 2 stroke gas trimmer and now battery trimmers.  This Black and Decker replaces my old Black and Decker 18v cordless trimmer.  That trimmer was still working fine after seven years of use, but I was offered this one and decided to give it a shot.Wow, what a difference!  The build quality has gone up quite a bit, and remember, my old one was going strong at seven years on the original batteries.  This one has far better balance and grips, and far more power than 2 additional watts would suggest.  Previously when switching into edger mode, I'd have to make 2-3 passes to cleanly edge my lawn.  This unit took one pass to do a job that looked as good as a corded edger.My lawn isn't that big so I haven't used the &#34;Runtime Extension&#34; feature.  The automatic feed spool works as well as my old model, so no stopping to feed out more trimmer string.  I also really like that it comes with two batteries.  One is all I need for the trimmer, but I usually get the blower and edger (I have all three in 18v) and I've found the leaf blowers can go through 2 batteries easily, so I can put this extra to good use.Overall I have to give it five stars.  Between my B&D; 18v trimmer, blower, and edger and my 36v cordless mower, I've never had any problems and all my batteries still work.  Whatever they are doing, they are doing it well.  And this model just feels like it's built better than it's very reliable predecessors.  If you are in the market for a cordless trimmer, I don't see how you can go wrong with this model.",1403136000,2014-06-19

5.0,"At first I didn't like this Corona pruner because it didn't seem to cut well.  Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide, and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces.",1370131200,2013-06-02
5.0,"This Goal Zero 7 Solar panel charger is amazing.  I couldn't believe it actually works - it looks deceptively flimsy.  It is great for emergencies and backpacking -this is a versatile charger.  It is also very durable on the outside and light weight.  It charged my iphone, my kindle and the 4 included AA batteries.  Although it does not come with AAA batteries it does come with a clip/adapter where you can put AAA rechargeable batteries inside.  (I believe that you can buy AAA enelope rechargeable batteries and they will work.)  Since it is fall there wasn't much sun so I had to keep readjusting the screen for maximum impact.  I also notice the screen got scratches easily and I wonder if this affects charging in the long run.  Weather could be a big issue and frustration.  It works best in full sunlight when it gets overcast it didn't seem to charge at all for me.  Due to the poor sunlight, my batteries still did not fully charge the first day.  I did like that the battery charger has its own light which is good for emergencies and that it has a USB port to directly charge other items from it.  (I understand it is actually better to charge items other than the batteries directly from the battery charger and not directly from the system itself because the battery charger regulates the energy flow.  If you connect your phone or tablet directly from the system there will be fluctuation in power going to the items depending on the amount of light.)I really liked this item and was really impressed.

5.0,"Love it! This was my first drip irrigation installation and it was very simple to install. Really wish I would have done it sooner. I paired it with a Melnor Aqua Timer and it's working like a charm. Matches brown mulch fairly well, but I do plan to cover it up with more mulch.I thought the kit had quite a good assortment for a starter kit. I personally needed more than one end cap and a few more galvanized stakes to curve around shrubbery as the tubing is kind of stiff (small pruning shears will cut the tubing, maybe even scissors). The great thing is that all of the Rain Bird items did arrive in only one Amazon box.The 1 GPH emitters make it easy to give more water to plants that like it wet if you have plants with various watering needs, and the tool makes those very easy to pop into the side of the tubing.

5.0,"I think this is a good value really - don't make the mistake of comparing it to a water soluable food - this is the type of food that you put out and it works for about 12 weeks/3 months - this provides extended feeding - so 1 or 2 applications, depending where you are, might get you through the growing season.I've used this in my soil mix to start pansies with, and they are doing great.  The iron content helps the leaves stay nice and green, and they are growing much faster than when I've not used it.  (I used Jungle Grow/Hyponex, instead of the more expensive potting soils that already have fertilizer in them to test this in my greenhouse- and this is really just as good.)I've also used this on pansy seedlings, in pansy seed starter mix, on full grown pansies, petunias, dianthus, and marigolds, and it really seems to encourage healthy plants and abundant, blooming.  I saw an increase in blooms just a few days after application.  I like to apply mine right before I know it will rain.

5.0,"In our home and camp we have pets and do not want to have any sort of hazardous chemicals or traps in the house.  If you expecting immediate results, you are setting your bar too high.  At camp there was still evidence of small rodent activity for a week before we started to see results.  We had another similar device that lasted for several years and so far, so good with this one.  In an unattended camp, rodent activity can wreak havoc on things like insulation or wiring, to say nothing of unsanitary conditions.  For example, in our area we have red squirrels and they can be very destructive.According to the small enclosed brochure it states that ""Consumers repeatedly tell us that they have had great success using the PEST OFFense product to control rats, mice, and roaches  . . .  ants, spiders, squirrels, crickets, silverfish, waterbugs and earwigs.""  I can only vouch for the absence of mice and squirrels as those are the critters I don't care to have around and tend to be abundant in our area.For each level of your home you will need one of these devices.  For example, if you have a two-story building, you will have to purchase two of them.  The directions clearly state where to place each unit for maximum effectiveness.  If don't place your unit in a centrally located circuit on one floor I wouldn't be at all surprised if you have spiders or ants on the other end.

5.0,"Moving to a smaller property back in 2003, I found myself no longer needing my riding mower. I looked at several options in the gas mower lineup. After talking to a couple of electric mower owners in my neighborhood, I went shopping at the local hardware store and brought home the earlier version of the Black & Decker MM875 Mower. Like other gas powered tool owners at that time, I seriously had my doubts. That changed after a few weeks use. I'm very surprised that after eight years, this mower is still up and running.Weighing in at 52 lbs, this 12 amp mower cuts a 19"" path in no time. With adjustable wheel heights ranging from 1.4"" to about 3.5"", it does a nice job. I like the one touch feature for wheel height adjustment. There's no fuss and tightness to contend with. I don't miss the noise of a gas powered motor. Unlike the newer version, my mower has a straight handle bar with a comfortable grip. The start handle is conveniently located on the right side and has a good feel to it. Other then that, there's really not that much of a change from the original.This mower is light and easy to maneuver around bushes and trees.  It does an average job of mulching. Mine came with the side discharge chute. The rear bag that now comes with the newer units was an optional purchase back in 2003. Even though I don't use it much, the folding handle is a nice add on for owners with tight spaces. As far as power cords go, I picked up a good 100 foot length 14/3 gauge outdoor extension cord. Its not that hard to manage the extension cord. When using any power tool, its all about staying alert.Like any piece of gear, proper maintenance is paramount. Prior to using this or any mower, its a good idea to coat the undercarriage with a non stick spray. I use the generic grilling spray on mine. I give the blades a good coating too. Since the body isn't metal, I use a rubber spatula to remove any buildup. Afterwards, a good wipe down. Its a good idea to inspect the bolts, nuts and screws for tightness after each use. Just like gas powered mowers, it does take a little bit of effort to remove and replace or sharpen the blade. I always sharpen my blade before the start of the mowing season and every other month. When sharpening the blade I use a fine tooth file. It can be sharpened with a good stone too. I got about 5 years out of one blade.Besides replacing the blade the back flap needed some help too. The original flap lasted me about 7 years and wasn't that difficult to remove and replace. Protection wise, Black & Decker offers a two year limited warranty on the mower and a lifetime package on the mower deck. I've not used their toll free customer support number for the mower, but I have for other Black & Decker products. The customer service that I did receive was outstanding.Overall, I am very satisfied with my Black & Decker mower. It has been a reliable lawn tool that quietly and efficiently gets the job done. With proper maintenance I expect to get another eight more years out of this one. In closing, I can honestly say that I don't miss my old gas mowers one bit.",1303689600,2011-04-25
5.0,"But please, remember where you left it.  You don't want to find a little pile of skeletons and fur in the bottom.First I put it under the kitchen sink, but I think the cats have really decimated our domestic mouse population. No takers, no one even tasted the bait.  then I put it in the wool shed where I knew we had an active problem.  The first time I forgot to turn it on, and the peanut butter was licked clean, so I re-baited and turned it on again.  Other than putting wool in and taking wool out, there is no reason to go out there.  When I remembered, it had been out there for over a month in the hottest part of the year, against the west wall of an unshaded shed.I couldn't really count the remains, but there were many.  Next time I will put newspaper in the bottom. It smelled like fly trap attractant which is why I'm going on about checking it frequently.The light was still flashing after four weeks, so it is economical with power.

I decided to give this Contech ScareCrow a try.  I erected it in front of the den entrance and turned it on just before midnight, when I was sure all the raccoons had left their den.  An hour later, it fired and I heard the sound of animal running away.  All was quiet afterwards.  The next day, I spent all day erecting another barricade - a much sturdier one this time, with grade A "" lumber, 1/4"" steel screws, and "" steel nuts and bolts.  I left the ScareCrow where it was, just for good measure.  During the week, the Scarecrow fired a couple of times during the night and that was it.  The raccoons never returned to attack the barricade again.The nature of and solution to animal problems vary extensively, but for the narrow purpose of keeping raccoons from getting into their den, this Contech ScareCrow passed with flying colors.  The whole unit is made of plastic; it may not last very long under the hot desert sun of the American Southwest, but it did work as it was supposed to right out of the box and setting it up was a breeze.  Other reviewers complained about short battery life; perhaps a lithium 9V battery may help.",1300752000,2011-03-22
5.0,"Stellar Jays and squirrels cannot get into this feeder. Chipmunks...are a bit light, so they still can get there if the pole isn't greased with baby oil, so still have to oil the pole, but the major feeders are not able to get much unless they are quick or clean up from what is dropped by the smaller birds. It's well built and looks great.",1401753600,2014-06-03

5.0,"Great watering can. I love the fact that there are two handles, which is great for heavy buckets of water. I found that the two spout options are nice. I used the shower spout to water my hanging baskets, and used the pour spout for watering my bushes. The watering can is a nice size, so I am able to water more than one plant at a time. Anything with a Fiskars name, I have found to be a very good and durable product. Once again, well done Fiskars!",1341273600,2012-07-03
