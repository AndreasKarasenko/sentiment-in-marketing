1,"Hair all over place, shower curtain rod broken and couldn't keep closed, water went all over floor, insense sticks sticking out vent and cover burnt, hair dryer didn't work, wrong insert for coffee non usable, room didn't get cleaned at all next day. Staff not knowledgeable at front desk, housekeeping was told to come to room and never showed. Maintenance did show and was ok but not the most interactive. Front desk no apologies given. 1 of our worst stays ever.",2017-04-14
1,"Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again.",2014-11-18
1,There are so many mixed reviews for this Inn. Perhaps we should post the room number when we write the reviews. I was in Room 102 with two beds. The sheets had old stains on them. There was a very musty odor to the room that was only made worse when the air conditioning was turned on. The door closed... More,2015-10-29

No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room.

When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard.

Are room was left in tact . They haven't refund my money back and has not show me what so called damages. So be aware of their scam !,2016-09-07

1,"We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.",2015-06-10
1,"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",2018-03-18

2,"I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room. I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean. I found a dried up contact lense in our bed, there was mildew in the tub, and the room could have used a sweeping. The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again.",2015-01-27

2,"Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for.",2016-01-08

There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist.

I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors. Lighting in hallways was dark and scary.",2016-05-02
2,"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.",2018-08-20

2,"I paid over 190. The pictures looked nice but they were deceptive. The outside looks like a Motel 6. The rooms were nice on the inside with modern decor but the staff was extremely rude. I travel a lot, domestically and internationally. This was a very unique experience in the way I was treated upon arrival. I would not recommend this hotel. I should have either stayed at a bargain hotel or went for it and spent the 400 to stay at a nice place downtown.Melissa R - Please let me start by apologizing to you for your disappointing stay. Our practice is to make sure all our guests feel warm welcome. I would very much like to speak with you, so that I may get more details regarding your experience.

2,"Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff.",2016-05-18

3,"Bad: being told we had missed our free glass of wine as we arrived to late, how hard would it have been to just give us a glass, also being told no free breakfast included as we booked via bookings.com, when you book with bookings.com you want to feel valued not at a disadvantage. no kettle, what is it about Americans not putting a kettle for a nice cup of tea in each room, you will get liters of alcohol to buy but why not just put a 12 dollar kettle and two mugs, costs so little but means so much. would boost my scoring on every hotel review i do. Good: position on south beach road is great, roof top pool great, nice room, hotel a little tired, stained carpets cracked bathroom work tops etc. my advice would be replace carpets in room halls ways from lift to room. lots of stains. iced water by lift this is great. lovely bed and pillows.stayed one night, lovely lady on reception day we left, helped us get a taxi.

Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking.",2016-06-04
3,"This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W.",2017-01-17

It seems standard these days that 1-bed rooms will be outfitted with a King bed and 2-bed rooms with 2 Queens or at least Doubles. Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins!

Front desk staff was rude, said I did not reserve with charge card and was ready to give my room away - I insisted she check records. she then admitted she was wrong and the room was already paid for. Upon arrival, nobody at the front desk - had to wait. understaffed for such a busy night. once in our room, discovered they gave us a king bed for 3 adults - had to go track down a cot since there was no other room to switch to. staff was short with me and my family. said we should have known to call the front desk when making the reservation, etc. etc - pretty much blaming us for not doing a better job with making reservations. Hotel is in decline with repairs needed (broken door locks, broken gym equipment, broken machine in breakfast area, clogged toilet, broken clock in gym, filter not working in pool adequately, etc.) Housekeeping had rooms clean, but common areas needed more attention. Towels in gym and pool area were low in stock. staff in breakfast area was very attentive and pleasant. Seems more staffing/attention to detail would generally bring things back up to snuff.

The hotel is on a street off the highway and by itself, so it is a quiet location with field and woods views in the back. On our first morning, the breakfast buffet had no food left by 8:30AM, so we had to wait more than 30 minutes to get anything to eat. On our third day, when we arrived back from the beach around 3PM our key cards would not open our door. When we did get new cards, we found our room had not been cleaned and only one towel was left for all of us to shower. In spite of the glitches, we would use this hotel again.",2016-07-30

After we settled in for the evening, one of the neighboring rooms occupants were having an argument. They proceeded to slam their door and yell in the hallway on and off for 30 minutes. They were loud enough to wake my husband over the television. When we left our room the next morning, the hallway reeked of marijuana and cheap air freshener.

Downsides are parking - had to park in the Commons garage but pretty walk back as long as it's not raining or snowing. And I really got the impression that a more traditional American bfast would be served but it was more like what you get at a chain hotel.,2016-04-30

The room was like a small suite, with a new flat screen. The couch however was filthy. The couches in the rooms that I saw when doors were open, all need cleaned big time. Bed was OK, comfortable enough. I asked for an unstained comforter when I got there extra pillows, and my requests were pleasantly handled right away. I must say, the staff were all very nice. Maids forgot to replenish the coffee in the room, and I had to go for it 3 times. But they were always nice and brought anything we needed.

Apart from the usual cold fare, the hot part included scrambled egg, home fries, and one other item (bacon or sausage or biscuit/gravy) during our stay. But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",2014-04-09

Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us.

I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

4,"My first time staying at a Best Western Plus and I was pleasantly surprised. The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review.

4,"The bathtub had scratches on it that shows black rust. The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it! Yet, rooms are spacious, TV is new, internet connection is good, and so is the location. Except from B-fast time and tub condition, I liked it.",2017-07-14

4,"I was looking for a place to stay near the airport and park my car for the duration of our trip. Drury Inn was a great place to stay. I parked for free for a week. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on!Thank you for your stay and kind words. We are happy you enjoyed our stay and fly package. We recently replaced our mattresses during our renovation and have enjoyed very good feedback. I need to try and get one for my house.

5,"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner. And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectations.As a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott, we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and design.We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future.",2016-09-13
5,"My husband and I decided to head South to spend our April 2018 birthdays in New Orleans. Our stay at the Troubadour was perfect. The entire staff (especially Jalen at the front desk and bellman) made our trip memorable and worth a return stay. This will be our home away from home whenever we're visiting New Orleans. Oh, and the buffet was simply marvelous!Thank you very much for choosing The Troubadour to celebrate your birthdays with us and we are delighted to know you had such a great time. We will be sure to share this among our team so they know their efforts did not go unnoticed and we do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,",2018-06-14

5,Stay in the Blue Room. It was really cute. The Inn was located right in town so we were able to walk everywhere. The cutest little lady owns the place. We had stawberry shortcake for breakfast and spent the whole time at the beach. the price was very reasonable as well. The owner even let us borrow her beach chairs. We are coming back for their blueberry festival. it is supposed to be HUGE.,2008-06-01

5,"The absolute BEST location for a downtown Seattle hotel just steps from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Centre, etc.. Fully equipped kitchen in the suite and LOTS of space -- larger than most one-bedroom apartments! Excellent buffet breakfast setup with top-notch food quality and very comfortable seating with views of the Space Needle, etc. The rooftop deck has lots of comfortable seating and fire pits etc,, so a wonderful place to wind down and end your day. Too bad the parking stalls are extremely tight limited however, it's to be expected for such a prime downtown location. We will be back for sure!877tiffanyl,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback.

5,"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu.",2007-02-21
5,I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Antonio! The room was so spacious and comfortable to be in. Large living area with comfortable couch and big tv.

This hotel is very close to Arlington Cemetery, and the Rosslyn Metro stop was a five minute walk away. They also have a shuttle to the metro.
