1.0,"The color was not at all what I expected. It's VERY PINK, and not in a natural way. The color shown here looks very natural, a pachy-pink color and perfect for my fair peaches-n-cream skin color. Sadly to say, it is so pink that I cannot use it. I'll find someone to give it to. Not for me",1468108800,2016-07-10
1.0,"This medium coverage foundation is way too dark for my complexion. I expected the warm beige to be like a tan, instead this foundation is more for women of color or those that have a deep olive or super deep tan. It has SPF 25 sunscreen protection.

In addition to the color issue, I found that it does go on smoothly. Every time I applied a little bit, I had blotches of color on my face and trying to blend it was practically impossible.",1498348800,2017-06-25

1.0,"The ease of application, the lovely color and from a brand I like made me immediately like this eyeshadow crayon. That changed in about 10 minuets, when I looked in a mirror and saw my eyes were a raccooned mess.
Nothing I did or used, moisturized, primers, dry, could get this eye crayon to stay on my lid without smudging, shifting and all but disappearing, except for a greasy mess in my crease.
I have very normal eye lids, I have always enjoyed exceptionally long wear time for almost all my eye makeup, so this is a serious surprise and disappointment.
I would not recommend, or repurchase.",1437091200,2015-07-17
1.0,"I started using this product with the practice attachment for about a month, and I waited a full week between uses each and every single time. I didn't see any really difference, but I liked it well enough to keep going. After about a month I went up to the next attachment which I believe is called ultra sensitive.

The first few weeks were okay. And then about a week ago I noticed that I have dark lines and discoloration on my face. Now, I initially wondered if the complaints of this might be due to stripping a tan or something. But no... the lines caused by this device on my skin are dark.

Now, when I say I watched the videos, I don't just mean the one that comes with the device. I do mean *all* of the videos. The bad reviews, the everything. And I went it planning not to use the more abrasive attachments, and not to attempt using it too often.

Maybe... maybe for some people using it every 2 weeks could solve the problem. Maybe staying on the practice head (which doesn't do anything at all, really) could be worth it. But for the price?  And the risk of having dark lines and discoloration across your face? It's really not worth it in my opinion.

I didn't pay the full price suggest here. I found it on sale at Nordstrom. And even at $60 less it still seems like a huge risk to take with your face especially if you have sensitive skin.

I did honestly like it after the first use of the ultra sensitive disc. But discoloration with the most sensitive option is absurd.",1489881600,2017-03-19

1.0,"Lash Loading? Talk about a hefty claim that seriously does not hold up. This mascara is more like ""smear"" loading. I usually use a volume mascara since my lashes are so light and thin. When a product promises :

High definition volumizing mascara. Inspired by the runway and behind-the-scenes tricks, JAPONESQUE Lash Loading mascara creates incredible lash drama and a super-charged false lash effect""

It better come through especially when its twice as much as the mascara I usually use (covergirl). First when I took the brush out, huge glob of mascara was at the brush end I had to quickly plunge it back in a few times to get rid of it, or risk it being all over my face. First coat was weak, second coat was the same. It gave no volume, it loaded no lashes, every time I brushed it on a bit would ""dink"" right onto my eyelid cause the formula is so runny. I was using make up remover left and right. In the end I probably used 4 coats and it was like using one. I would not ever buy this again.",1420761600,2015-01-09
1.0,"Below quality and performance for the price. Extremely aggressive,uncomfortable and poor shaving perfomance results. Much better razors well under $20 that exceeds the performance and quality issues.",1496361600,2017-06-02
1.0,"I had a horrible experience with this. I used a mitt to apply it (provided free from the company). It seemed to go on even, but the results were blotchy and gross. Most of it faded away within a week, but I still have blotches around my ankles, and it has been over three weeks since I tried it.

The one good thing I can say is that it smells amazing. I would buy a lotion with this scent, but I will never try another tanner from this company again.",1445817600,2015-10-26
1.0,"This is a very thin, clear oil.  It isn't as thick as baby oil and runs almost like water.  I would never put oil or an oil-based product on my skin because it clogs the pores.  Some people might be able to get away with it, but even though I have dry skin, my skin will break out if I put oil on it, so I have skipped that test.  I did rub it into my hands and it dries fast without leaving an oily slick.

What I did use this for is my hair, which is very thick and very dry.  After shampooing, I poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together.  Then I ran my hands through my hair, keeping the oil away from the scalp area.  Afterwards, I blew my hair dry then applied more oil.  Usually, I apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.  However, the oil did not produce the same results.  My hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it.  My newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair shafts, but the morning after I used the oil, the results were no different than the night before.

Ill stick to my gel product to end the frizziness of dry hair.",1390867200,2014-01-28
1.0,I would give this zero stars. Formula is very watery. Something is not right with it. I will be returning. Very disappointed for an OPI product.,1520121600,2018-03-04
1.0,"Baffled by the positive reviews for this face wash. I guess this could work for minor acne...but it didn't make a dent in mine.

1.0,"I am suspicious of this product. I have followed Ayurvedic practices for awhile and central to Ayurveda is determining one's dosha. Is this for pittas? Vadas? Kaphas? Is it tri-doshic? Or, is the manufacturer capitalizing on the popularity of Ayurveda and using conventional perfume making ingredients with a ""natural"" scent? It does not smell natural at all, but like a commercial perfume. A quick look at the Rituals site reveals that the Ayurveda line is only one of six scent lines, all with an Eastern theme. One of the ingredients, cyclohexene, is on OSHA hazard lists. It does contain some natural ingredients, but since Ayurveda is about balancing your energy naturally, why spray yourself with a mist created in a chemist's lab? Be your own advocate and if you're attracted to Ayurveda, don't fall prey to slick marketing tactics supported by pretty prose and photographs. Keep it simple, keep it natural.",1532217600,2018-07-22
1.0,"A lot of money for what? I have never spent $75.00 for any beauty product. I liked the idea of this product. When this came, it came in a box with six vials and six packages of 2 moon shaped pads. The pads are really big. They go from the corner of my eyes to my hairline. The vials have lots of liquid. So no worries of not having enough. However once you put the liquid on the pads, the real fun begins. Trying to apply the soaked pads is a real messy job. They are so thin and with the liquid they do not hold their shape. So you have to pat the pads to get them to stay so that you do not tear them apart. Also too much handling makes them turn to glue.

Next time I think I will apply a little bit of the liquid and then use a q tip to apply the rest of the liquid so that I can control how much I need or it just runs down my face. Plus, I doubt I will see any effects from using this.",1415404800,2014-11-08

1.0,"This hairspray reeks terribly of cheap cologne scent.  I don't think I'll be attracting any women with it either. It's terribly overpowering. So bad I had to actually jump back into the shower to wash it off. I only used two short sprays and it stunk up the entire bathroom.

I've had functionally bad hairspray but I would gladly use those over this one.  I would not use this hairspray under ANY condition given the unbearable scent. It would be such a huge turn off and I suspect it will most certainly irritate anyone within a whiff of.

I have never used a hairspray that smelled this strong, easily twice as strong as AXE body spray.",1477094400,2016-10-22
1.0,"The description says ""can be used with or without water,"" so I tried it both ways.  Without water left my skin feeling greasy, so I began rinsing it off.  Unfortunately, neither method was good for my skin.  Shortly after I began using this cleanser, my skin broke out--a lot.  I then began using the 3-in-1 simply as a makeup remover and then using my regular skincare regimen after.  That's how I discovered that this cleanser was actually leaving a lot of makeup behind which is probably why I was breaking out so much.  Although I like the milky feel when putting it on, this product simply doesn't work for my skin.",1455148800,2016-02-11
1.0,"This is a beautiful periwinkle blue, but streaky beyond belief.  I wear polish all the time and can apply my own polish with very professional results.  This took three coats and streaked even on the third coat.  It evened out with some Seche Vite on top of it, but it's still not perfect if I look closely in sunlight.  No worth all my hard work.  I'll take it off in a couple of days.  It's going in the trash.",1399334400,2014-05-06
1.0,"I was really excited about the concept of this product, as I am a powdered dry shampoo user in the interest of saving water, and thought this couch be a nice tool in my product collection, but it is truly awful.  I could see this being POSSIBLY useful for someone with really short hair who wants to skip a wash and have some lift if used JUST in the roots, but even that is hard for me to picture being manageable.  The product is so sticky and grainy that while it does have the effect of removing oil, what's left in your hair is way grosser than oil.  It might look passable, but it feels just terrible, my hairbrush stuck in it and it broke my hair, I couldn't wash it off my hands and after THREE shampoos, I could still feel it in my hair (getting a comb stuck in it), and that was all using a TINY amount, and rubbing it well between my fingers before applying it sparingly.

I used it once and thought it was gross but decided to at least play with it once more before a shower in case I had used too much or hadn't thinned it enough, but no, it was still awful.

As others have said, the smell is nice enough but not overpowering, which is the only nice thing to say about this product.  I am certainly glad this was a review item.. if I had paid the crazy price for this I would be returning it for my money back.",1475366400,2016-10-02

1.0,"I had high hopes for this product due to the reviews I had read and from the product description. Sadly I will never be able to see any effects as I developed a rash that has gradually worsened over the last 2 to 3 days. Within an hour or two of applying it for the first time my neck and chest went pale pink, this went darker and spots also started to appear. I stopped using it and have been taking benadryl but so far it isn't going away, although I am sure it will in due course. A very expensive mistake!!

I had planned on buying other StriVectin products but it would seem they aren't suited for me.

1.0,It still dries your skin out. It says to remove with tissue and not to scrub. If you don't scrub you can't remove it. When you scrub it shreds the tissue and leaves the tissue in balls all over your face. It feels totally gunky.,1357516800,2013-01-07
1.0,"This stuff is seriously awful. I was looking for a change from ORLY top to bottom because of its bluish tone and bought this. I didn't need to straighten my nails, but thought that something extra is always a plus.
Now I'm ready to cry... I used it only one time and six of my nails broke. My nail polish started chipping after one day of wear. It was chipping with upper part of my nails.

1.0,"This polish is either old, defective or ZOYA hasn't figured out how to combine performance with less toxic ingredients. As soon as it dried on my nails, many tiny lines formed across the surface of my nails. It was the strangest thing, almost like the polish was cracking. I hadn't even moved my hands! I removed the polish, shook the bottle well and tried again but the same thing happened! I then took it with me to a professional salon for a manicure and ended up with the same results so it definitely doesn't have to do with my application. Unfortunately, I can't return it because I threw the box away (because who expects to have to return a bottle of nail polish?) so I guess I am out the $10. :-( This was also my first experience with this brand (ZOYA). I wanted a less toxic product but it still has to perform to basic minimum quality nail polish standards. I won't be purchasing ZOYA again.",1525996800,2018-05-11
1.0,"I use this creme often and I buy it from amazon. It is one of the few products I really love and agrees with my skin.

I have had one other experience similar and amazon returned it.",1389657600,2014-01-14
2.0,"I have had the occasion to use several Vincent Longo products and I realize that this line of products provides a high quality product for a pretty hefty price.  In most situations I have found you get a really good product for your investment.  However, in this case, I am just not sure about this one.

SIZE
Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base comes in a black tube which looks pretty nice on the product page, but in reality, when you get it, the small size is rather shocking. There is only .88 oz of product in the tube, which if you translate it, you can imagine three tubes of Jack Black lip balm and that is about the size of this product.

TEXTURE
I have tried many times to see what might be different about this primer compared to many others out there.  I have to say after testing this repeatedly, I just don't see any advantage of using this primer.

The feel of this product is that you use a pearl sized drop of this product applied around your entire face and eyes.  When I do this, I feel a lot of silicone feel to it.  This leaves my face feeling like it has saran wrap on it of sorts.  It is hard to explain, but after a while of wearing this primer, I feel like my face wants to breathe and I want to remove it.

AFFECT ON MAKEUP

This primer base definitely does smooth out the skin and does allow for the foundation and other face makeup to stay on the face nicely.  It seems to make the makeup stay on well through the day and it does add to a nice appearance of the skin.  I also find when using this, that blush does not tend to change color like some other primers can do.  I still did not enjoy wearing it over time, however, so I am not sure it served that great of a purpose.

FINAL COMMENTS

For the price, I just don't see how this product is worth the money.  I have normal to dry skin and I didn't feel any particular moisturizing features from this base.  I get much nicer results when using Swanson Vitamins Hyaluronic Acid Serum which is very similar to Lorac Aquaprime which was discontinued.

I just don't like this primer and didn't feel it is worth the investment.  You get so little product for a very high price.  Using it under Vincent Longo Water Canvas Foundation does make it look very nice, however, if you have the money to invest and want to use them together.  There are other options that are more cost effective, however if you prefer a less expensive alternative base to use.",1392249600,2014-02-13
2.0,"Im never certain what a toner is supposed to do, but from my use of this, Id guess that the answer is absolutely nothing. I admit that I do not have any other products in this line, but I could see no difference in my skin. When I use it on a cotton round, I don't see anything but the blue of the toner on the cotton. I get exactly the same results from using water. I even tested it out once, using water on one side of my face and toner on the other. I couldn't tell the difference by looking at the cotton round or by looking at my skin. As far as I can tell, this is just smelly blue water, as it smells a bit like play dough to me.",1486425600,2017-02-07
2.0,"I purchased this and the cream Vichy roll-on deodorants to compare the two. While this one is easier to apply (it has a roller ball which the cream version doesnt) and dries faster, this made me break out in a rash which the other didnt.

2.0,"February 1, 2017 UPDATE: The battery, even when it has been charged completely, no longer holds the charge and the unit stops after only a few seconds.  Poor product when it lasts less than a year.

Attractive and easy-to-hold, the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush, White/Silver is as effective as it is lovely.  The slender, ergonomic shape allows you to hold this cleansing brush without slipping from your hand, even when it is wet.  Three different heads provide different options from cleansing your skin  one for regular cleansing, one to massage your skin, and one for sensitive skin.

Because I have sensitive skin, I love the specific head for that skin-type.  It does not irritate or cause abrasions on my skin  this is a definite plus.  It helps remove my make-up completely and leaves my skin feeling invigorated.  Individuals who can use the regular head or massage head will find these do an excellent job cleansing their face.

While the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush charges, a blue strobe-like light initially rotates around the brush head; it then glows steadily during the charging phase and goes out when the unit is fully charged.  The initial charge takes about six hours and lasts for 30 uses.  Three cleansing speeds provide additional options for your facial cleansing routine.  An additional plus is that you can use this cleansing brush while you are in the shower as long as you do not immerse in completely.

If you are looking for an excellent facial cleansing brush, I recommend the LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush, White/Silver.",1457136000,2016-03-05

2.0,"I purchased this item directly from the manufacturer, so I know it was genuine. I was super excited to try this product bc it looked so exciting and different. I also loved the potential anti-aging effects with this item. BUT...the big but is whether or not it cleans better than my Clarisonic Mia. It doesn't. I alternated using the Mia one night and the Luna the next night, several nights in a row. Whenever I used my Luna, my face still had grime on it - it was not as clean as the nights I used my Mia.

Also, I find it an oddly shaped and designed device for the face - it's hard to get it to fit everywhere. It's basically like taking a flat-ish rock and trying to clean your face with the tip of that rock. Not always a good fit.

For now, I'm sticking with my Mia and will be returning the Luna until the design is much improved....they should've waited to bring this product to market, in my opinion; it's just not up to par as the excellent face-cleaner that it's meant to be and marketed as.",1455667200,2016-02-17

The rounded tip on the end gets in my way and it didn't really carry enough mascara to do my bottom lashes.  The mascara made my lashes clump together which is the main reason why I don't like it.  So instead of 100 lashes to flutter, I had 30 stuck together.  I may give it another try, but my first impression is not good.  However sometimes a mascara is more liquid at first and then settles down and then it doesn't clump.  But I still don't like that round ball at the end.

2.0,"I wear mineral sunscreen on my face daily. I've worn everything from professionally compounded mineral sunscreens to over-the-counter product.  Unfortunately, this TIZO 2 Non-Tinted Mineral Sunscreen caused problems for me than it solved.

PRO
1) It's a mineral-based sunscreen.

CONS
1) Once on my skin, the lotion felt oily and dry.  It stayed that way until removed with soap and water.(I have sensitive, *dry* skin, and it made my face feel oily to the touch.)
2) It feels cakey and oily when worn with face powder or makeup.
3) If you have oily skin or sensitive skin, it may not be the choice for you.
4) It seemed to take a lot of product to achieve full coverage of my face and neck.

When you add powder (I used this same brand to try and follow suggested use), it gets rather muddy and cakey, looking very thick.

Now on to the negatives.  I have long, thick lashes, and this mascara makes them look very thin.  It adds no volume at all, but rather makes them look spikey.  By the end of the day, my lashes are no longer smooth, but are bent at weird angles.  AND I have flakes under my eyes.  Not only that, but you can't add more mascara once it has dried.  So if you've done your makeup in the am and want to oomph up your mascara before you go out after work, you can't.

I bought a tube of this for my youngest daughter, because she likes waterproof/water resistant mascara, but always struggled with removal.  With Kiss Me she can simply get her mascara off in the shower.  But I don't think it does much as far as adding any lash drama, and she does get some flaking.

All in all, unless ease of removal is your biggest concern, I wouldn't recommend this mascara, especially at the $20+ price.",1270598400,2010-04-07
2.0,"Tried this after becoming very disappointed with the AOS (art of shaving) shaving cream line. This wasn't the solution. Ingredient list has all the right stuff, but I find the lather to be extremely weak. Very very small layer of protection even when I use a generous amount of cream. Can't even use my badger brush and a bowl to bring a healthy lather, just won't work. Experimented with proper amounts of water several times to see if I could find the right consistency, but could never find it. I would amount this to being the shaving cream. I will continue my search as this product just wasn't for me. The art of shaving provides a better leather, but is very drying. This product makes canned gillette creams look like the ""cream of the crop"".",1394236800,2014-03-08

2.0,"This grooming kit comes in a nice, supple leather case.  However, it seems quite overpriced for what it is.  You get 1) a metal file and nail cleaner; 2) a manual nose and ear hair trimmer; and 3) a cleverly designed set of clippers with a retractable lever.  After using the set, I think the clippers are the only element that reflects typical Henckels standards and quality.

The file is fine for what it is, but it's nothing special.  It's a stainless steel nail file with a decent finish.

The real downfall of this kit is the rotary trimmer.  It is a manually operated trimmer (i.e., you have to hold the mid-barrel piece and spin the cutting shaft assembly by hand).  And it does not cut hair so much as it pulls it out.  It was an unpleasant experience to use it on nose hairs as some of them are growing from highly sensitive areas.  In the past, I have used a Panasonic battery-powered trimmer and never had a similar problem; the Panasonic cut the hairs with a rapidly spinning blade.  This trimmer, on the other hand, is difficult to operate because you cannot hold it perfectly still while also spinning the cutting shaft assembly with your other hand.  Sure, it isn't going to cut your flesh, and it feels substantial.  But unfortunately it appears to have been designed for masochists.  There is a small brush inside the base of the trimmer to help wipe away the follicles the trimmer pulls out with the hairs.  This device appears to be the principal reason the kit costs so much, and it ruins the value of the kit.

The nail clipper is fine and sharp.  You operate it by pulling the lever to extend it from the body of the trimmer and then, once it pops up, by pushing it forward to put it into position to generate leverage.  The clippers are sharp and work well on fingernails.  But they alone are not worth the price of admission for this kit.

If I were to receive this as a gift, I would suspect that the giver was trying to punish me for some (imagined) slight.  Better than being sealed behind a brick wall perhaps, but only just.

Not recommended.",1442102400,2015-09-13
2.0,"I saw this product, Crepe Erase, available in the Amazon Vine program and wanted to try it because my skin is starting to look old (crepey) in some areas mainly due to constant tanning when I was younger. (The product description actually states CREEPY-looking skin in one place; I assume this is a typo!)  Given the list price of this, it is not something I would likely buy myself; luckily, I had the opportunity to try it free of charge.  The 10 oz jar is quite big.  If they marketed a jar about one-third of the size (and about one-third of the cost), I think people would be more likely to try it because it would not be so cost-prohibitive.

I was not familiar with Crepe Erase, so I did some reading about it on the Internet.  Crepe Erase is made in the USA and is distributed by Guthy-Renker, a marketing company that sells products to consumers through infomercials, television ads, direct mail, telemarketing, e-mail marketing, and the Internet.  They use celebrity endorsements for their products.  Jane Seymour is the celebrity endorser of Crepe Erase.  The products marketed by Guthy-Renker are usually more expensive than similar products available at your local grocery and drug stores.  Bottom line, the question is:  Does Crepe Erase work better than other comparable products to make it worth its price?  Well

I have now used the product for almost two weeks.  While Crepe Erase works well as a moisturizer, I have not seen any noticeable difference in the youthfulness of my skin.  According to their website:  Results can vary for each individual.  Some users can notice visible results after the first application, while it can take others up to 60 days or longer.  Directions state for best results to use with Crepe Erase Exfoliating Body Polish, which I did not do because of the cost.

Bottom line, based on cost and results thus far, I do not recommend this product.  However, I will continue using it until the jar is gone and will update my review should I notice any changes in the appearance of my skin.",1460592000,2016-04-14

I am not sure who the intended market is for this product but I ended up with an unpleasant orange tone to my skin. Unless I followed this with a lot of foundation, I could never wear it to work or out. I might take it with me on a camping vacation where no one will really see me.

It took three minutes of too-vigorous rubbing to get it to completely come off.

However, if you don't have waterproof makeup then this gentle cleanser might be for you. My skin did not react negatively to it after a couple weeks of use.  There is no smell, no dye. It feels and looks ...like water.

Even with just regular makeup, however, I felt that I need a more substantial cleanser than ""water"" because my skin still felt dirty. I would use another regular cleanser after this and indeed picked up quite a bit of makeup on my washcloth.",1477526400,2016-10-27
2.0,"In the past, I have used Juice Beauty's moisturizer and was so pleased with it I thought ordering this acne set for my teenager would be a no-brainer. Boy, was I wrong!

 First, I must address the odor issue. The face wash and acne clearing serum smelled absolutely rancid.  When we first opened the acne clearing serum tube, the content came squirting and losing out. The serum was very liquidy, like water with smelly brown grains.  It looked like  puddle water and smelled like pond scum.  I immediately checked the date on the box, but we weren't near expiration.  I don't think the serum should have had the consistency our tube had.

 My son decided to try it despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.

Although she did spend six months at the Aveda school learning new techniques, this is a young woman who made it her business, from a very young age, to know everything about make up.

With an item as pricey as this, presentation means something, although it hasn't affected this review.  While the colors were rich and deep, the color material was too malleable to create a straight line, which may be why there is a ""smudger"" attached (a recognition that you probably won't be able to get a straight line?).  It does not apply well over eyeshadow, but suffices for bottom eyeliner.

The nail clipper, on the other hand, is a bit flimsy and hard to open.  It's also made of stainless steel, but it's so thin that its difficult to cut your nails. Unfortunately, the design is great but it falls short on functionality.  I find that it slips out of place.  I have long nails and I bent one of them when the nail clipper slipped out of position.

The consistency is gel-like (hence the name) more than a heavy cream but when it dries it seems a little stiff.

I was happy that the fragrance was pleasant enough and my overly sensitive skin accepted it without complaint.

3.0,"This hair dryer is powerful and can produce enough heat to burn.  It has 5 different heat setting and 5 different fans settings that give you 25 unique combinations.  With that many combinations there is a setting that is perfect for every type of hair.  The dryer is also light and ergonomic.  Most of the dryers weight is centered about the handle which makes it very easy to hold and use.

But (and this is a huge BUT) the digital display and the controls on this thing are just down-right wacky.  The color-coded display is particularly strange because it is linked to the fan speed and not the temperature.  When you increase the fan speed the color of the display cycles from yellow/tan to green to blue to orange to red, but when you increase the temperature using the heat control buttons the color of the display does not change.  IDK, but this seems backwards.  You should get the red display warning when the temperature is maxed out not when the fan speed is maxed out.

Even the instruction manual highlights the strangeness of the color-coding.  Page 7 gives the temperature ranges of the different colors as:

Yellow  99 F to 205 F
Green - 111 F to 212 F
Blue  108 F to 219 F
Orange  106 F to 230 F
Red  122 F to 241 F

With such large and overlapping ranges the colors have no meaning with regards to temperature.  A more accurate table would read:

Fan Speed 1  Yellow  possible temperature ranges: 99 F to 205 F
Fan Speed 2  Green  possible temperature ranges:  111 F to 212 F
Fan Speed 3  Blue  possible temperature ranges:  108 F to 219 F
Fan Speed 4  Orange  possible temperature ranges: 106 F to 230 F
Fan Speed 5  Red  possible temperature ranges:  122 F to 241 F

So nice hair dryer that can be customized to handle any type of hair, but the digital display still needs some work.

PS: some tricks to using the controls that the instruction manual does not tell you about.
Press and hold the MAX Fan button for 2 seconds to switch from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Press and hold the MIN Temperature button for 2 seconds to quickly reset to the lowest fan and temperature setting.

That's my major issue with this one.  So naturally you end up using too little or too much, and once you shake off too much into the top area it's stuck there, there's no getting it back into the bottom.

As far as setting powder, it works, it just doesn't help with shine at all and honestly I saw no difference between this and using my more ""compact"" type foundation as a setting powder instead.

But even after the toner dries, it doesnt absorb well. . no matter how long you rub.  I just wait a bit before I leave my condo so you cant see all of the white streaks on my face.",1392854400,2014-02-20
3.0,"When it comes to protecting your skin in the summer, using the right sunscreen with UVA/UVB protection is of the uptmost importance. However, if thats all it has, it won't be enough. Your sunscreen also needs to protect skin from infrared-A (aka IRA) rays as well, and heres why. Besides the sun, these rays can also come from less-obvious places. When you blow-dry your hair, or even get a gel manicure, your skin is exposed to them. IRA rays travel even deeper into skin than UVA and UVB rays, causing free radicals that further accelerate skin aging. What you're left with are fine lines and wrinkles no matter how much sunscreen you're putting on.  With all that said, we now understand why we need sunscreen. Sunscreen is now the new skincare standard.  We must use sunscreen to fight aging.  In paricular, we must use a sunscreen with infrared protection.  I have been using Goop sunscreen in SPF 40 and find it amazing.  It is clear, weightless, scentless and oil free.  I have never had a breakout using it.  It always goes on smooth and I never have to worry about my foundation applied on top, balling or pilling or just making a general mess of my face.  With the Skinmedica, I had the same results.  It however is not clear, nor scentless and I did have a few break outs when first using it.  The price of the Skinmedica is $57.80.  The price of the Goop is $28.00.  So the question is, why would I buy a product that works the same, has no other benefits over the other, has less SPF and costs quite a bit more?  The answer is simple.  I will continue to buy the Goop.",1530576000,2018-07-03
3.0,"I have very sensitive eyes and take allergy medication regularly.  I have dark circles under my eyes and one of them waters regularly particularly with eye makeup.  I am sharing this because my own health issues may be affecting my results with this product.

For me, it made no difference whatsoever.  My experience was it didn't make my dark circles and puffiness worse and there was no noticeable change.

I also used it imperfectly to be honest.  When my eyes felt irritated, I didn't use it.",1443571200,2015-09-30
3.0,"I ordered this product because of some irregularities on my face and discoloration near my eyes. I don't normally use much makeup, so I wanted a light textured, natural looking product. This product feels a bit heavy and goes on a bit less smoothly than other products I've used. I used my finger to fix that and it looked better. I am more used to a semilar cream with a more liquid texture.

As a concealer the Dermablend product works very well, and though it has a rather odd fragrance, it disappears pretty soon after the product is applied, so fragrance may not be a problem for those who are sensitive. The color was a bit darker than I expected but it blends fine with my skin tone anyway. The product comes in a small, easily transported container, and the one I received looked fresh and appealing.

All told, this is a good product. Recommended to those who are happy with a drier, more less creamy texture.",1498262400,2017-06-24
3.0,"According to the box, this H2O PLUS WATERBRIGHT ILLUMINATING NIGHT CREAM (1.7 ounce) is ""clinically proven to enhance skin's radiance, clarity, evenness, complexion, brightness, and texture, all while reducing the intensity of dark spots.""  If the company says it, it must be true--and I certainly want to believe it.  But I can't help wondering how you clinically test things like ""clarity"", ""radiance"", and ""brightness"" of skin?

When I applied this cream to my face at bedtime, it felt fine at first, then it started to sting.  (I do have sensitive skin, so a lot of products produce this effect.)  The stinging subsided after 5-10 minutes.  However, the strong floral fragrance stuck around for hours, and made me even consider getting out of bed to wash it off.  (One does hope that regular boyfriends and husbands generally like this fragrance.)

The next morning my face looked about the same as always, but I'm sure you need to use the cream regularly to see any beneficial results.  Also, the box says, ""For optimal results use with Waterbright Illuminating Serum.""  The serum is also available on Amazon (about $50 for 1 ounce).

The night cream's dispensing jar is nice, though it's confusing if you haven't encountered one like it before.  You remove the flip-off top, then push down on the screw-off top until cream comes up through the center hole.  One push dispenses enough for a single application, so you don't waste this expensive cream (about $54 for 1.7 ounce on Amazon).

If you can afford this H2O PLUS line of skin care products, then I say go for it.  Because this night cream appears to be an effective skin moisturizer, I rate it at 3 stars (""It's okay"" on the official Amazon scale).",1479168000,2016-11-15

She started using t he Obagi products many years ago and I will not complain about the results, as she easily looks 15 years younger than her age.  We had to start mail-ordering the products because Texas put strict standards on products with hydroquinone, thus cutting the number of available suppliers and hiking the amount you pay.  My guess is that Obagi is starting to reformulate some products to avoid the restrictions in Texas and perhaps other states.  She will not be re-ordering this product unless she can get ""the real stuff"".  I can't get much in the way of specifics as to why it performs differently.

The problem is that you need to keep applying it under they eye area several times a day to really get the benefit from it.  I have used several other under-eye creams and this one just does not do what it promises to do.

The skin around the eyes is the thinnest on the face and can be most prone to damage and showing the sign of aging. When applying tthe cream carefully under the eye, using the ring finger because it has the lightest touch, you are less likely to harm the delicate area.  After a month of using the cream and following the recommendations, I can say that I saw absolutely no visible reduction of lines under and around  my eyes.  As someone who is over the age of  40, having an emollient rich under eye cream is important to me - especially during colder winter months when the skin requires more moisture.",1447977600,2015-11-20
3.0,"Well... it goes like this: if you really, really want to smell like 'old men' after the shower, try the Man Made Wash because will. Seriously.

I suppose it's supposed to be a 'old fashion' but I tend to be allergic to fragrances and this is one body wash my body or skin is not super enthusiastic about. My standard for a 'good' body wash is one that does not smell at all and does not suppress the skin's natural and healthy odor. But the Man Made seems to aggressively attempt to replace that with some combination of stale tobacco, old leather and sweat which maybe make some feel good or more manly but it makes me want to go back to the shower and wash again with something else to get this odor off.

My three star rating stand for: ""if it's not good for me, it doesn't mean that everyone should avoid it."" Because it does the wash part. It's only the smell that makes me disagree.",1474156800,2016-09-18

It was just the perfect color for me and didn't gather in my crows feet or run when my eyes water.
Update after using it for awhile I'm not very happy with the brush applicator. The brush gets hard and crusty and it hurts to push it against the sensitive skin under my eye. The cream comes up through the middle of the paint brush applicator and I never know till it is too late how much I am pushing out!

But I can say this - when I gave it a try it reminded me exactly of rubbing mud on my face at the Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa in Reykjavik, Iceland (look it up). Feeling that more might be said, I turned this over to my wife, and this is what she had to say...

""I have been using beauty products for over 20 years.  I've used almost everything, from inexpensive to very expensive brands.  I hadn't used a mask in a while and jumped at the chance to try this one.  This was BEFORE I realized it was a product for men.  What a disappointment!  Overcoming my disappointment, I decided to try it anyway... and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a nice clay mask.  It dries well and after rinsing my face feels very smooth and clean.  I have sensitive skin and was pleased to note this did not dry it out or cause any kind of adverse reaction.  This product is priced a little less than a similar Clinique product and I would say it's in the same ball park as far as quality.  If you're a man who wants a skin car product, this seems like a good bet.

4.0,"Beautifully packaged. The smooth, rectangular tube weighs twice as much as Wet 'n Wild cheap packaging on its sometimes very good quality but miserably packaged lipsticks. I often buy inexpensive lip products, so this finer packaging really feels luxurious to me. The color, Lucky, is similar to many of the neutral's on Colourpop's site. I just bought a bunch of those, so they're easy to compare. I'd say Lucky is just a bit pinker than CP's Magic Wand, quite a bit pinker than CP's Chi (my favorite). It is matte, but a touch shinier than I expected, which I actually like. It moisturizes nicely, which I expected from the ingredients. What surprised me was the amount of fragrance and plumping ingredients. The primary plumping ingredient is the Menthoxypropanediol. Its penetration is enhanced by the Tribehenin. It's the Menthoxypropanediol that gives the slightest menthol scent. I did experience some tingling from these and saw the slightest bit of lip plumping, but only when I applied the lipstick somewhat more thickly than usual. I also tested the lipstick by applying a ColourPop Ultra Matte to one side of my lips and this to the other side and definitely saw plumping.

4.0,"The color that comes out of this sunless tanner is incredible.  I am very familiar with sunless tanners and used St. Tropez tan foam with a mitt for the application.  On the first application, I only had time to put it on for an hour but had planned to have it on for three.  I felt really sticky with it on and wanted to rinse it off.  I was very impressed that the tanner left my skin darker than my ""dark tanner"" that I leave on all night frequently.  I am not a fan that it feels a little sticky and I cannot wear certain clothes because it has a bit of a residue.  However, it leaves a wonderful gleam on my skin that looks healthy and natural.  My skin looks healthy, hydrated, and cared for. Foams usually do not last as long as sprays and I prefer to have more on hand.  I also notice that its hard to tell when foams will run out so I am not sure I like that it is a form of application.  I will update with time but the color is beautiful, natural, and it actually lasts like a tan.
Pros-
1. very dark and natural tan achieved unbelievably fast
2. smells like perfume without as much of a sunless tanner smell
Cons-
1. quite sticky when on until rinse
2. If you miss a spot it is noticeable because of the drastic difference in tone. However, it is pretty easy to blend.

A little does go a long way and while I like it a lot, I pay the same for a Creighton coconut and Cocoa butter based lotion that is 33oz for the same money. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly good but maybe I'm not firmly enough in the target market for this product.",1458518400,2016-03-21

This is a UV cured 'gel' polish.  Done properly, a CND Shellac will last 1-3 weeks.

I have softer flexible nails - My nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer.  Acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic 'off brand' gel polish, they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak so I decided to buy the CND kit & do it myself (also saving me $ in the long run.)  Before Shellac I gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day. What a waste to spend all that time painting and drying for it to peel away the next day.  I type a lot at work as well as boxing and packing stuff so I am tough on my hands.  Shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy WITHOUT any filing.

4.0,"I just bought this color and tried Infinite Shine for the first time. I am blown away! I had to come and leave a review.

Pros: it's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate.

It dries fast; I painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it's totally dry. I also love the color. It looks a lot like You Dont Know Jacques.

Cons: None yet! I will check back in to see if it truly lasts the 7-10 days as advertised.

Update 11/1/15- Sadly, the product does not last that long. I've tried two separate colors and it only lasts about 3 days before it starts to chip. Definitely better than a ""regular"" top coat, not nearly as good as my gel nails at home.",1443139200,2015-09-25
4.0,"One to two pumps is all you need for full coverage of your face and neck. This potion is very smooth and silky going on, and covers very well.  Almost like it's skimming along the surface of your skin more so than being absorbed by it, although after a bit of time it seems to be 'in' the skin. It has a pleasant scent, but does leave a slightly sticky residue on your hands and face. (Very noticeable as flakes on the skin if too much product is used.)

The product's website details this product in the following way:

""This powerful, dual-action anti-aging serum helps visibly lift skin and acts as a non-invasive line filler to help temporarily smooth out the look of fine lines and wrinkles. It contains a rare, exclusive orchid extract which comes from the Emerald Coast of France and is designed to enhance natural production of healthy collagen and elastin in the skin.""

It's part of a skin care line that if used regularly promises amazing results. Unfortunately I don't have the entire line to try out, but this 'filler' - used to temporarily smooth fine lines and wrinkles - is a good product from my brief usage of it. It does add a moisturized layer to the skin; especially around the eyes, that gives the skin a plumper appearance.  Used underneath my mineral make-up, I noticed a subtle, positive difference.

I do get a slight blotchy redness right after applying it, and some very minor tingling.  This does disappear rather quickly though. I think using less is actually better and it may not be necessary to smooth it all over your face as much as the areas around your neck, mouth and eyes.

This product is expensive by comparison to other products I've used and I look forward to giving it at least 30 days to work its magic. Ideally I would use it for 3 months, but I'm not sure there's that much product in this 1 fl oz bottle.  I'll definitely update this review the longer I use the product to let Amazon shoppers know my experience with it over an extended period of time.

UPDATE:  7/18/16 - After a month of consistent use I can say this product works very well to make my whole face and neck feel moisturized.  My skin seems plumper - more elastisity - and does seem to make the appearance of fine lines (especially around my eyes) significantly less noticable.

This stuff is really remarkable in the sense that it takes one pump (very small amount) to get full coverage.  My 49 year old skin is generally fairly dry so I was afraid this product would be sucked in never to be seen again.  Much to my delight it went on silky smooth, with no oily residue.

The inital red, blotchy skin reaction I got when I used it went away within a week of use. Maybe my skin got used to it?  Really smooth applicaiton with no tingling after two weeks of use.

On the downside, it's not ideal with mineral make-up.  What generally had a matte appearance became more 'oily' looking. Perhaps it was the timing of the application of my makeup, but I always tried to apply these two products at least 1 hour apart to give it time to absorb.  Despite this, I would continue to use it. It's not a miracle cream, but it is very good!  I still have product in the bottle after 1 month which is truly surprising to me.

4.0,"I've applied this top coat to my regular nail polish and really does increase the shine and give it that glossy Gel polish look. I do think it extended my wear time by a little bit (but not by a large amount of time...maybe it works better if you use it with a Londontown Nail Polish rather than another brand).

I did really like the shine it gave to my nails (without having to go through the hassle of curing my nails with a UV light) and it was very easy to apply.",1506124800,2017-09-23

I know that the product description says this can be used on your lips and cheeks, but I feel like that would look really weird on all but the bravest ladies.  The compact is a nice design that fits neatly into my makeup case or purse, and I like that the colors look great on my pale skin.  I have VERY sensitive redhead skin and this did not cause any irritation after using it for 2 months, so I feel confident recommending it for others with sensitivities.",1513036800,2017-12-12

4.0,"This is a very different type of foundation, very thick, it comes with a little spatula to remove some of the product for application.  This process did take a little getting used to for me, using the right amount and blending it evenly but once I got the hang of it it really did cover well and didn't use additional concealers with it.  I used a sponge to apply this and blend it for a nice even coverage, you could use your fingers, however if you are prone to breakouts or skin irritations then a sponge seems a better option for less oil and dirt. I used the Dermablend Powder over this foundation and it really set the look and lasted all day.",1499731200,2017-07-11
4.0,"H2O plus water bright Illuminating night cream is gentle and clean, delivering well rounded moisture to my face and neck It is  fully absorbed by my skin without leaving it dry even after several hours or after skin exposure to dry, windy weather. I have tried several creams, toners and oils to help help brighten and even out my skin tone  as well as eliminate dark spots and I have found that this cream does a better job than many others. I particularly like its non greasy feel, that although most moisturizers with similar price tags promise they many times do not deliver. I also am pleased with its sweet aroma, as it is not overpowering or intoxicating, and seems to be delivered by its natural ingredients of snowflake flower and pomelo extracts. I would recommend it as a standard nightly moisturizer as it shows noticeable results within weeks' time even without the commended usage of the same brand's day serum. The only drawback that I found was in the design of the container as I found myself taking off the pump and the lid at the same time because  they seem to stick to each other and are not easily distinguishable.",1479081600,2016-11-14
4.0,"I am not very good at styling my hair, never used a rod curling iron, and found this one very easy to use.  The glove (which I had also never used) made it easy to wrap my hair and hold it in place without worrying about burning myself.  I  have very thick, coarse hair that is hard to curl and my curls held it all day with no hairspray.  I was expecting to have to flat iron it after my first attempt but to my surprise it looked good and with just a little more practice would look even better.  I expected the rod curling iron to be tapered like most others I have seen, but it is all the same width, so it looks just like a traditional curling iron but without the clip.

The only reason I took off one star is because I do not see the benefits of using a rod curling iron over the old fashioned type of curling iron that clips the end of your hair.  The two minor issues I had would have been solved with a regular curling iron--it was hard to get the curl all the way down to the ends of my hair, and my arms got tired having to do my whole head.  With a regular curling iron I only have to hold the rod with one hand and can switch off but this style of curling iron requires the use of both hands the whole time.",1520726400,2018-03-11

Very simple to use. Apply on your face, being careful to follow directions and over applying. One pump is all that I find to be the required amount. It absorbs nicely into your skin and leave a really refreshing feeling. I do not have many wrinkles but its good to know that this product will help to keep it that way or even better, remove the few that I do have.

5.0,I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.,1467331200,2016-07-01

5.0,"I first tried this foundation on a day that was extremely humid and 94 degrees Fahrenheit.  Heat index was 104.  The product worked great, working more like my own skin, than a coverage on it. It is very lightweight and applies smoothly and effortlessly.  I got ""Buff"", and was surprised to see that it matched my skin tone perfectly (more on the color later).

I sprayed on my usual toner with witch hazel; let that dry, while I gave this foundation a good shake-up (holding down the button on top to allow all the foundation to re-mix).  The lid unscrews and releasing the button on top sucks foundation up into the dropper.  The foundation applies a little lighter than what you would expect, but the ""whiteness"" disappeared while I was lightly blending it in.

Hot and humid as it was that day (still is....) that I almost decided to not ride my bike around the campground.  But I did.  And it was a great trial for this foundation from Bliss.  It allowed my skin to breathe normally.  Sweat did not ooze or hover underneath the coverage.  Felt like I was not wearing anything.  Sweat dripping down my face did not sting my eyes.

Is the SPF 20 strong enough?  For me, yes.  I tan easily and very seldom burn--haven't burned in years and years because I usually wear something that has SPF 20 in it.

How does the color compare with what I've been using?  My usual foundation are two Bare Minerals products:  Bareskin (lighter weight for summertime and SPF 20) and Complexion Rescue (a bit richer for the colder, drier months and SPF 30).  This ""Buff"" color of this Bliss product compares nicely to the Bareskin Bare Natural 07 and the Complexion Rescue Suede 04.  This Bliss Buff color is a very nice balance of tint:  Not too much orange, not too much yellow, not too much pink.  I can't do too much orange, yellow or pink pigment.  Buff works well for me.

The color shown on the product page is very much the way it actually is.",1467590400,2016-07-04
5.0,"I am in love with this Thermal Styling Brush!

First thoughts - IT WAS SO EASY.

My hair is thick and it usually takes a good fifteen to thirty minutes to flatten, curl, tame my hair. It leans to the body/frizzy side of the spectrum, so I like to flatten it, if I'm going out for something special I will curl it.

I ran this baby through my hair and did some quick flips and tugs and I had hair with a bit of body, which was sleek but not flat to my head, which is what flat irons usually do to my hair.

Again my hair is thick, very thick actually, but fine. Worked fine for me. All I had to do was run it through my hair and turn it in a C for the ends to have a bit of curl.

Highly impressed and I'm set on NO MORE PONY-TAIL days!",1457568000,2016-03-10

5.0,"The great thing about scents is that they smell a little differently on every person and mix with your body chemistry to sometimes change the scent into a fragrance that is entirely pleasing or one that is totally nauseating. This one, Artisan by John Varvatos, worked great for my husband -- who is a die hard Acqua di Gio fan (and I love that cologne too). I am really into scents that are more ""fresh"" and lighter than the heavy stuff like Drakkar Noir, etc. so I was very happy he liked this too. I actually wore this myself to work one day just because I like the smell, and I didn't mind that it sort of 'wore off' slowly over a couple of hours.

On him it has a citrus start when he first sprays it on and then after it dries it has a more woody scent though I find it very hard to analyze the different components of a perfume or cologne. I didn't smell the floral component as strongly as others have mentioned. I like that it is pleasant and not overpowering, and actually, I'm glad it doesn't stay at max potency for hours and hours. I don't want a man's smell to overwhelm my senses while I'm eating or on a bus or plane. Just a hint or whiff of fragrance works -- not like he's bathed in a tub full.  I think that liking or not liking a scent is a very particular thing for each person. That's why it is so important to ""try on"" a scent just as you do with other things you wear. Fragrance can make a statement about you and it might take awhile for you to find one that says what you want it to.

It presents with a caramel-colored rattan woven cover over the spray bottle inside a cardboard box. If you like citrus and woody smells on a man, you would probably like this but I'd suggest you try a sample first before you buy the whole bottle.",1457568000,2016-03-10

5.0,"The key here is blending. It is crucial to this product looking natural. Therefore, even if you get your absolute closest color-match (find your perfect shade in the mall but buy it here!), you will still need to seriously blend this since it is for a small concentrated area. So apply this sparingly (you can even use a small brush instead of indiscriminately applying from the tube). Once you have the area properly concealed, grab your Beauty Blender and feather out those edges especially ... blend, blend, blend. If you need to add a bit more, use a brush to touch up just those areas and blend again.

Do use a powder to set this. (I used Laura Mercer since it is translucent and amazing). Not only will it help prevent color-transfer, but it will provide a more natural appearance. (But, do be careful ... this will still transfer to clothing if one isn't very careful).  To the best of my knowledge, this is one of the best products you can buy to conceal blemishes, tattoos, bruises, etc.

It's not absolutely perfect, but in the right hands (careful and patient hands), it can definitely conceal whatever you need concealed. Give it a try!  Highly recommended!",1500854400,2017-07-24

5.0,"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1526515200,2018-05-17

While I agree that it has its own unique (and not too overpowering) scent it's hard to pin down exactly what it smells like. The scent is described as ""rose, raspberry and coconut"" but I swear I smelled vanilla. Also, I definitely smell flowers, but I don't really pick up on any raspberry. Some of my favorite perfumes are fruity, so that's a bit of a disappointment.

Nevertheless, this has become one of my current favorites for when I want a scent that's strong while not being too overwhelming.",1475452800,2016-10-03

5.0,"For many years, I've wondered how my hair stylist makes it look so easy when she's blowdrying my hair.  I'd watch her technique and try to mimic it at home, but it was never the same.

My hair is shoulder length with a few long layers and my round-barrel brush would never glide through my hair while I'm drying it at home.  Instead, my damp hair would just stick or snag on the brush.  So, for years, I've been doing more of a full blowout each time, separating out each small individual section, wrapping it around the brush, fully drying it, and then moving on to unclip another small section to repeat the whole process.  And, sure, the time-consuming blowout looks nice and full and great--but who has time for that each and every time?

All this time, I've assumed that ""I"" was the problem--like maybe I'm blowdrying-challenged or something.  But, no, it now seems that it was more the brush than my own inadequacies.

I've been using 2"" metal-barreled Goody and Conair brushes for I don't know how long and I'd *thought* that my latest one was particularly nice with its squeezy gel handle.  But after reading some of the reviews of this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bio-Ionic-Blue-Wave-Nano-Ionic-Conditioning-Brush/dp/B001RUYKVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bio Ionic Blue Wave Nano Ionic Conditioning Brush</a>, I decided to order it and give it a try as a change.

I'm now a blowdrying wiz.  (Okay, not really...but much, MUCH better than what I was before.)  The slightly 'squared off' barrel allows you to catch the hair down near the roots to get lift there.  The best part, though, is that the brush does that gliding thing that my hair stylist's brush does.  You know, where the brush lifts up at the roots and then glides down the whole length of the hair section as you're drying it--and then, with a slight roll of the brush, starts right back up at the roots again.  I was never able to do that with my old brushes without it snagging and stopping.

I'm really not sure why this brush works so much better for me.  Is it the squarish shape of the barrel that does it or is it the ""Natural Ion Complex"" that the bristles are supposed to be infused with that allows the brush to glide?  All I know is that it takes me less than half the time to dry my hair now and the finish is much smoother.  Highly recommended.",1423440000,2015-02-09

5.0,"This is a wonderful, thick balm cream that provides excellent soothing on shaved skin. It is designed to be used after shaving and its perfect for that. But it can be used in other ways as well. Ive been taping my ankle lately due to a slight sprain and the sports tape  irritated my skin after 8 to 12 hours. So, I applied a little of this balm cream to the area just before putting on the tape and easily went 18 hours without the slightest irritation. Its clearly evident that the soothing ingredients truly work.

The balm cream also has a light, clean, bright scent that disappears almost immediately. Its not overwhelmingly masculine, so could even be considered unisex.

The ingredients are: AQUA / WATER - DIMETHICONE - GLYCERIN - ZEA MAYS STARCH / CORN STARCH - ISOHEXADECANE - SORBITAN STEARATE - C13-14 ISOPARAFFIN - 2,6-DIMETHYL-7-OCTEN-2-OL - STEARYL ALCOHOL - AMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE - POLOXAMER 338 - DISODIUM EDTA - SUCROSE COCOATE - CAPRYLYL GLYCOL - HYDROXYAPATITE - LAURETH-7 - EPERUA FALCATA BARK EXTRACT - DEXTRIN - LACTIC ACID  POLYACRYLAMIDE.

If I understand correctly, its the EPERUA FALCATA BARK EXTRACT (the fourth ingredient from the last) that has the most significant soothing properties. And Im not the only one to notice this. According to a rosacea support group, Eperua falcata bark extract: Rich in flavonoids, this natural active reduces skin hyper-reactivity and protects against inflammation. I couldn't find a lot of scientific studies, but this soothing after shave balm cream really soothes.",1494633600,2017-05-13
