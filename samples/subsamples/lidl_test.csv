1,"It doesn't work anymore, I've lost all my monthly bonuses and the customer service doesn't help. Answering to you: no, I'm sorry it's a bug since my phone is good and all the 100 apps I have work properly",2021-10-08
1,"Piece of junk, keeps logging me off which I can only notice when opening the app at the cash desk. No useful discounts.",2022-04-05
1,"I can't tell others what I think about the app as I have no idea how to scan it at the till. Why are there no actual step by step instructions for oldies who struggle to understand, let alone cope with this technology, or alternatively a printed coupon to use?",2022-04-28
1,Not interested in any of these apps most of these apps most of these apps just drive me mad they come through all times of the day and I do not want any of them,2024-01-24

1,Keeps crashing,2021-11-25
1,"Too complicated, forces update which will not load so I am unable to use my ¬£2 voucher that expires today. Just junk:",2022-05-21
1,Crashes every time during registration. And there is no PC account creation option. So useless c...,2021-10-12
1,Twice app has failed.It is frustrating as this seems to be a fault with the app. I even changed my phone as I was told my old phone was not compatible. How does this encourage OAPs to shop with Lidl.,2022-02-03
1,I can't seem to find a damnn shops in my area where i give it the correct adress and all full necessary details but i can't find a single shop i could click onto to proceed with the logging in. And before i reset the app as well i couldn't access the app telling me there is some type of failure to show me the discounts and everything in the app except am able to click just to register my lidl plus. . . Which now i cant even access because i deleted and installed it again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Just nonsense!,2023-12-01
1,"¬£10 off at the end of a month made this a great bonus and great app, now I need to spend more to qualify for a 10% off which means to make the most of this now I am doubling what I spend per month when already spending more than needed to obtain a reward Well done Lidi you dangled a carrot and took it away at a time it was needed more than ever",2022-08-31
1,Can't select store so won't work,2024-03-01
1,Rubbish. You've updates T&C's and when I tick agree and then press next it just reloads the page. I have done this several times now and still the same happens. If I try to go back it asks me to continue or log out? I can no longer access the app at all until I've agreed to the updated terms. üòí,2022-02-03
1,I have tried for 3 days and several times to register with Lidl Plus app but the screen just frozen after completion and not registered at all,2022-09-24

1,Says store closes at 8pm on Sunday app doesn't let you log in last 8 visits had same issuies not good at all now so if had option of minus stars it would be now compared to how app was until start of new year,2022-01-30
1,Poor,2022-05-05
1,"Update to my previouse review, app still won't let me use the account it says it registered to my email, yet whenever I try to log in to that account it says it doesn't exist,when you use the FAQ page it asks for an account number, how can I give that when I haven't been allocated one, to make things worse I have tried this with another email and nada. Can I please get some help that doesn't involve a robot, I shop at lidl on a daily basis and I can't even use the benefits of the app",2022-11-30
1,Poor says update znd you can't,2022-02-24
1,I can't get a verification code sent to me... it just won't come through.,2023-12-20
1,Difficult to log in,2022-02-24
1,Can't switch language from Greece back to Serbian. Scratch coupons don't work (it doesn't display coupon when scratched),2023-10-26
1,Good idea like the app but vouchers don't last long. Do majority of shopping in Tesco where clubcard last a year. I save vouchers for Christmas spend. Since my last review this app has got even worse. The scratch card awful. When you win something it's for the most random useless product The rewards reduced even more. This is why Aldi had my 2023 Christmas spend,2024-01-02
1,"Don't understand why you advertise Lidl plus in Northern Ireland when we don't have it. Local store anywhere on the mainland, do you forget that NI is part of the UK too?",2022-06-11
1,"Data collection for no reason (on my end,probably they sell them for money)...i still get recommended stuff i don't need or want. Similar to the offers... After 2 years of use...still no purpose ..still 1 star review",2024-01-29

1,"Advertisements at TV, advertisements at internet, advertisements inside of the shop and 20 minutes ago I ask how I can apply for the competition the answer of the cashier was "" I have no idea"". And after that when I remember that people talk about ""Great Britain"" or "" This Country will be great again"" i have one more question - How ?",2022-01-27
1,Too intrusive. I don't want to share my address and phone number! Enough already!,2022-11-23
1,"Easy to set up and use app, only downside is that it frequently doesn't scan in at the checkout and because I've got digital receipts I'm at home before I realise. Frustrating.... Update....one star less... it's still happening üòî",2023-10-21
1,Coupons are given to you when Lidl know you cannot use them so they are giving you nothing,2021-12-26
1,Completely useless! Who has time these days to hunt for coupons???,2022-05-19
1,I feel the same as other customers it has been devalued for what you used to get for spending ¬£200 now you have to spend ¬£250 for what Lidl what to give you to me a total rip off,2022-11-11
1,"I have been using this app from the time it was launched. It is excellent to keep your electronic receipts, however other than that it is pretty useless. All the coupons are of no use to us so basically no rewards for swiping the card.",2022-12-27
1,"App won't open, seems a bit pointless to have the app if I can't use it",2022-02-26
1,USES APP TRACKERS TO COLLECT AND SELL YOUR DATA TO COMPANIES YOU HAVE NO ASSOCIATION WITH AT ALL GOOGLE IT.... DELETED AS I VALUE MY PRIVACY HIGHER THAN A FEW PENNIES OFF PRODUCTS. ARE YOU LISTENING LIDL?,2022-08-31
1,Why are you more interested in sponsoring football and tennis and not looking after your loyal customers. No more weekend offers or wine offers. Without us you are nothing.,2023-04-21
2,"The one advantage I saw was that it showed me how much I was spending at Lidl. Otherwise, I don't see any benefits.",2023-11-23
2,Its update after updates. A months transaction s not recorded unless I update .this is a nuisance every time at till especially when I buy tools that have 3 yr guarantee because the receipt we get is black and fades very quickly. Any more updates. Well the shopping will become less. These updates are tracking all your transactions on fone everything,2023-08-10
2,"Not much use as the scanners dont pick up on the QR code most of the time when using self service checkouts, which is what I mainly use, so pointless activating any codes as you can't get the discount applied. You can't scan the barcode on receipt either to have discounts applied to your account afterwards and used on next shop. Needs to be changed to a barcode system instead of QR code imo. Response to Lidl reply...I know how to use the app and activate coupons, the QR code doesn't scan!!!",2021-12-27
2,"Coupons and rewards expire far too quickly. ¬£2 of your next shopping for spending ¬£100 is fine, but having it time out after a week, or even a month, is absurd. It is not a reward if it is taken away again before it can be used. As others have said a lot of coupons aren't very relevant, and the service needs to be more personalised.",2023-01-25
2,Is great,2022-09-07
2,Too short time to use coupon. Not everybody can shop few times a week. So in that way we loose the coupon.,2022-10-29
2,"App is becoming a bit of a con. Once you pass the ¬£50 or ¬£100 reward, it's only available for a few days to cash in. I only shop once a week, so the coupon expires. The 'prizes' are merely discounts, so you have to buy them - not a prize in my book. Not sure what the point of the app is now?",2022-08-23
2,"Language setting are stupid, when your location is in England it's in English. If you are in Finland it's set to Finnish but why not allow to use English when in Finland and other way around? The websites in English so why not app?",2022-10-03
2,"Unecessary complicated. Registration like this, is done in 1 view. Installed it for discount card and it throws an error, when I try to open it. And yes, I'm logged in. Also it's laggy and loads slowly even un fast wifi.",2023-04-30
2,"I use the app but the updates are so big I'm being told I can't update without deleting other apps on my phone, including WhatsApp. I can't bypass the update... Don't know what to do ‚òπÔ∏è",2022-08-03
2,Not enough offeres and opertunities to save money. Coupons expire far too quickly. And also a healthy option would be good to have as a free things instead of bread. Eg. 2 bananas,2022-07-11
2,"Works OK. But I'm not sure it is of any use. Used it for a few months, had the offer of a discounted pastry but that all. Doesn't accumulate what has been spent. ? Just a gimmick or am I missing something?",2024-02-16
2,Why so complicated password?,2023-07-21
2,Only thing with the coupon plus is that you cant roll them o ver to tge next month üòå,2022-04-04
2,You can only select GB or Ireland. When I go into either of them I can't access NI,2023-12-30
2,Should be in english as well,2022-04-21
2,Takes me too long to access data to open app and I am conscious of other people in the queue becoming impatient. Cant always find the discounted items in store so it would help to have them together or with an appropriate sign. Discounts and coupons should remain valid for longer periods; perhaps we could have the option to extend for a month if they are of interest.,2022-04-05
2,Needs to be overhauled not thst good,2022-05-01
2,App doesn't work,2022-02-25
2,"Barely adequate app. Lidl are not well known for their digital shopping experience and this app does little to change that view. As a tool to communicate Lidl promotions and to keep a record of receipts it performs it's job. Unfortunately the promotions are usually pitifully underwhelming - but worse, you actually have to select coupons within the app to benefit from the offer. It's not sufficient to simply scan your Lidl barcode (like the entirety of all other shopping apps)",2024-01-08
2,Hasn't worked yet for coupons. Tempremental with reward coupons - even misses some receipts . Not impressed.,2022-10-28
2,Tells you nothing about every day groceries and non offer items. Aldi app is much better.,2022-06-19
2,Actieproducten zijn enorm vaak niet voorradig. Wel je persoonlijke gegevens en voorkeuren binnenharken en omzetten in geld maar leveren ho maar. Dan houdt het op. Inmiddels doe ik elders mijn boodschappen.,2022-12-22
2,Leaflets dont work at all. Why do they want me to activate avery single offer one by one? They just love to waste your time.,2023-01-12
2,Vouchers are great. 7 days to use pointless,2021-10-07
2,"For Lidl Plus in Switzerland - country full of international people with international jobs, English is not available language. Whyyy? Good luck everybody with translating...",2022-07-28
2,Changed their reward system from ¬£10 off your shop after ¬£200 spend to 10% off your next shop after ¬£200 spend. Hardly worth doing now.,2022-09-01
2,Your Lidl plus app is not reliable sometimes it's OK then it won't let me sign in or it says there is already someone who with the same details.,2022-10-22
2,"The app has up to now been great, but updating g is an absolute nightmare, takes forever, and unable to use the app unless you update, not good.",2022-04-23
2,The same coupons all the time which I don't even use,2022-02-24
2,Zao mi je...vas dobar komentar je istekao,2023-08-29
2,Forcing the user to update the app when he's standing at the till trying to access the card is a really unfriendly act. Unhappy user. The evil barstewards did it again. Pro tip: keep a screenshot of the card printed on paper and laminated at credit card size.,2023-07-21
2,A bit awkward to use in-store but that should be better when the screens come down,2022-03-01
2,Coupons are all in Spanish and pictures too small to see what is on offer,2023-01-18
2,"What's up with a credit card like nectar ? It's complex to understand what to do. Then i need to have my phone with me to gain any advantage, i don't like taking my phone everywhere, it's a bind that prevents freedom, especially , more so when you get tracked even if your not doing anything wrong. Then it's only the rich who gain, they can afford to spend and gain the bonuses, if your poor like me, there's a pittance to be gained for the sake of having to have your phone on you",2024-02-18
2,"The offers don't match the Customers' profile & most of the time the Stores have either run out of ""offers"" items or haven't received delivery from Head Office !!! Lidl need to get their act together or they will lose Customers !!!",2021-11-10
2,"I'm really sorry for the rating but for me personally the app isn't of much use. I eat a whole food plant based diet so many coupons etc. are irrelevant for me. But for others I'm sure it could be very useful. Tut mir leid f√ºr die Bewertung, aber mir pers√∂nlich bringt die App nicht viel. Ich ern√§hre mich pflanzenbasiert, weshalb die meisten Coupons oder Gutscheine f√ºr mich irrelevant sind. F√ºr andere k√∂nnte es aber dennoch sehr praktisch sein. Auch die Option, damit zahlen zu k√∂nnen usw.",2022-04-11
2,Unable to open coupons it says no Internet when I am online,2022-12-20
2,"App is working okay but worthless cupons and rewards to me. Also what is the point of activating coupons before scan my digital card ? Offers should already be loaded, this is just slowing process at the tills as everyone trying to activate majority of worthless coupons. You could workout some better algorithms offers a better usable coupons. Rival supermarkets are definitely better at this game, but there is always room for improvement .",2023-01-13
2,"I like the idea, but would also like a physical card, as I do not naturally have my phone available on check out. Also. I have difficulty remembering to use the app even when I have it along",2022-09-30
3,Ok,2022-12-02
3,I have stopped shopping in lidl recently as the foods I want seem to be out of stock so I now go to supermarket where one shop will do and often find the lidl plus deals co fusing and at times don't scan properly Till,2022-04-08
3,Should be able to add points later if you forget phone other stores do,2022-04-05
3,"Appin k√§ytt√∂ kassalla eritt√§in hankalaa, ja pitkiss√§ jonoissa aiheuttavat merkitt√§v√§√§ viivett√§. Taustaj√§rjestelm√§n pit√§isi hoitaa k√§ytt√§j√§kohtaiset alennukset automaattisesti ilman puhelimen r√§pl√§yst√§. NFC olisi ehk√§ oikea (rinnakkainen) ratkaisu bar-koodilukijan ohella. Mutta paras ratkaisu olisi alennetut hinnat kaikille, ja kertaostoksen alennus summan suuruuden mukaan plus NFC tai perinteinen tunnistekortti, ajo- tai sv-kortti.",2021-10-17
3,Often doesn't work or wants to update when at till,2022-02-25
3,"By≈Çoby 5 gwiazdek, gdyby kupony za zakupy by≈Çy spersonalizowane na podstawie naszych zakup√≥w. Jestem wegankƒÖ, wiƒôc na nic mi setny kupon na dro≈ºd≈º√≥wkƒô z budyniem.",2021-12-05

3,I have a lot of trouble with my app.,2022-07-25
3,Why am I offered some stupid stickers by cashier? Why aren't those collected in the app?,2021-11-20
3,Sometimes unavailable but appears to update later.,2022-02-25
3,"Very good, however a little complicated for my old brain",2022-08-22
3,Doesn't always open. Only offers coupons not great savings,2021-12-07
3,Great app BUT for a while it was working on all Android platforms. Stopped working on my Samsung S5. I've got a new phone so it's fine now. How many others will be barred cos they don't pay ¬£1k for a new phone each year?... My Mam will no doubt be barred from it too at some point. Not cool!,2021-11-04
3,"App is OK, but old style marketing (limited time to use vouchers) FOMO. Has the opposite effect, not everyone wants to shop every week, why not also reward the ones that do a fortnightly shop? I have.no problem with the app, its good. But please stop trying to get me to change my shopping habits, its more sustainable to have less visits.",2022-06-18
3,Good saving for a customer,2022-04-30
3,Good app but offers are rarely relevant to what I buy,2022-02-25
3,Needs updating too often,2024-03-06
3,Only given 3* as the offers you win are always on items you would never buy. The best part of the app is the ¬£2 and ¬£10 off. Plus the free bakery items too.,2022-07-30
3,Takes time to get used to using it,2021-12-27
3,Tried to tap onto the Select your store and nothing happens.,2022-10-19

3,If you work to 2200h then keep it open until 2200h if not then update your working time accordingly.,2023-12-11

3,This app gives push notifications even though I did not give it permission,2022-03-03
3,"A bit of money off is always welcome. However there are 2 main issues. 1. The coupons . Think lve used 1. Clearly not based on my shopping. 2. The ¬£2 and ¬£10 coupons are only valid for 7 days. They need to be longer. A lot of people have a weekly shop. So if for some reason you can't make the next say Friday, and have to go on the Saturday, ¬£10 lost. They should be valid for 10 days or perhaps 2 weeks.",2021-11-13
3,"I rarely spend enough to be worthwhile, as my husband does half the shopping, it would be helpful if we could have a 'dual' account. Is there a way to organise that?",2023-02-01
3,Only seems to reward you if you spend large amount of money,2022-01-02
3,"Usually good but found that if I did not use my ¬£10 discount within a week, I lose it. As I have earned it for what I have spent in the month, I should have until the end if that month to spend it!",2022-02-25
3,Just installed this app after making acc it was fine but when I reopened the app it says update but there's no update yet,2021-10-27
3,Extremely bloated and slow. I just need the QR code loaded fast... I don't want to watch animations and review all the offers available while at the store checkout.,2023-01-28
3,Ridiculous app! If you dont use it for a while it kicks you out of your profile. And the requirements for a password are as its your bank account. Everything else is good.,2022-07-25

3,Slow app,2022-02-25
3,"The Lidl App when it started was brilliant. ¬£10 off after spending ¬£200 in a month. We used to go there to shop due to this. Its now changed, so we now shop around again as the rewards are less at Lidl, and we pick up others elsewhere. A shame really. But staff are fab.",2022-10-13
3,"Difficult to find the products in tha store, Better to have % DISCOUNT",2022-02-26

4,Helpful friendly staff quality products at great prices.,2022-03-28
4,Good app but offers could be targeted better as a lot of the offers are for things I don't buy. So the offers don't really work as an incentive to shop there more often.,2022-03-19

4,"I have never had a problem with this app apart from the more and more often you have to update WHY it doesn't make any difference. Coupons never relate to anything I ever buy but maybe that's the point!!! Really good thing about this app that isn't made clear about, is you don't NEED your phone, cashier can input your phone number before you pay so no need to ever miss out on your points.",2022-11-22

4,App is fine until you get in the store and need to connect to their wifi to open the app. Mobile signal is poor sometimes in store owing to the building and buffers. Also the freebies are poor in relation to the monthly spend.,2024-03-29

4,"Really like the idea of it but like others mention, it's a bit fiddly to get along with and as also mentioned, the vouchers do expire quite quickly like if your not shopping twice a week. This all still during a period in which we are requested to stay distanced, not to mention commuting expenses and pollution to the environment.
