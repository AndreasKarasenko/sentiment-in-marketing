1,"Lot's of bullying and often rage baiting ultimately a poor and upsetting experience. Don't want to comment on anything you don't know who's going to end up harassing you because your opinion might be slightly different. Feels uncomfortable and unsafe and the harrassment is very personal. Was fun for a short period, USE WITH CAUTION! Just went to check it out again dam disgusting topics nah deleted not worth getting constantly harassed even if you change your name very unsafe app.",2024-03-08

1,What happened wattpad.cc,2024-02-01
1,Just an awful interface. Left in the shade by pretty much every third party alternative which Reddit Inc. have ruthlessly eliminated to the absolute detriment of their user base. A textbook example of how to ruin a platform. Would not recommend.,2023-11-08

1,"Garbage coding, wanted to share a post and shared a different one automatically for no reason",2023-12-24
1,"Absolute fascist trash! You will be banned for objectively stating an OPINION supported by FACTS. With all due respect, Reddit and Facebook, and apps like them, are part of the problem with our society. I hope you are all jailed for suppression of free speech. With any luck, TikTok's ban will be the beginning of the end of of CHINESE-RUN apps.",2024-03-28
1,"Just doesn't work. The app is so broken, it wouldn't even let you sign in",2024-03-25

1,"Horribly optimized. Scrolling is laggy, videos intermittently don't play. Needs a lot of work",2023-10-30
1,That nice y'all put back the old lay out. But WHY can't android users edit their custom feeds! Is this some power trip for apple users!? By the looks of its been a year since folks compliant about it. I guess android users is important.3/2024... Still can't edit customer feeds 😕,2024-03-21
1,"Unable to Authenticate. I have un-installed, reinstalled, logged in/out on other devices, cleared cache and data... and still unable to get into my account, but only on the phone. No response from support or anything yet, and it's been a couple days now.",2024-03-25
1,I need a dev to download this app and tell me with a straight face that it's usable,2024-03-15
1,This app is terrible. Bad UX and awful optimization. And don't get me started on privacy and tracking. On top of that now the Reddit company is pushing their API update to force out all the 3rd party apps that are better alternatives than this p.o.s. Why create a better product when you can just push out the competition?,2023-11-08
1,Everytime I try to comment the app crashes. Seriously Reddit if you want to consider yourself a big boy of social media then resolve the most simple things first.,2023-12-05
1,"Latest update made the app stop working, the screen freezes as soon as the app opens but you can still click on posts. Needs fixing asap or no one will be able to use it",2023-11-21

1,Lappu sa hai,2024-02-20
1,"Bad view that what 3rd party used to offer, and the app frequently shows the "" we run into a problem"" message",2023-11-25
1,"Honestly a horrible app, the community is bad, if u break the rules once ur permanently suspended, i got suspended for making a joke so the mods are also bad. I recommend u dont get it, many apps do the same thing but theyre all 20x better. Reddit sucks.",2024-03-05
1,"Forced me to rate it, so here's the rating.",2024-02-13
1,"New update is so buggy, nothing is loading properly",2024-03-29
2,"Seems like the latest update has made so when I post nothing will actually post...it I'll give me the green post submitted icon but when I check my profile the post isn't there...not shadow banned cause I checked, but what's the point if I can't post anything 😔",2024-01-23

2,Good for children.,2024-03-23
2,Crashes way too much,2023-11-18
2,Terrible UI,2024-03-18
2,"Poor substitute for Baconreader. Hate that left swiping a card to get to the next post often brings up my user profile instead. Too hard to access multireddits. Barely any ability to customize how app works. Only using this trash app because they killed off competing 3td party apps. Now use reddit about 10% as much as I used to, only when necessary and no longer for fun because it's painful to browse this way.",2023-11-26
2,app keeps crashing or not loading edit: won't let me reset my password either. app keeps saying try again,2023-12-11
2,The app is not loading the post and if I want to see comments it is showing error,2023-12-05
2,"Don't know how this app has become so frustrating to use over time. Couple years back it was 5 stars, now it's 2 2. Loads unreliably, crashes constantly & other bugs galore. Rarely use this app now due to how difficult & slow to use it is. I don't even like using the browser due to inability to switch back & forth easily. On top of the fact that Reddit pushes you towards the app. Don't get me started on the ads, holy moly I see more ads & recommended pages than content from subreddits I'm in.",2023-11-13
2,Reddit is Fun was 1000000× better than this app,2024-02-11
2,Dear reddit. I don't want to review you. Please leave me alone so i can enjoy you. Low star rating because you keep annoying me to rate you. I'll rate you lower if you keep bothering me. I'm wearing you!,2023-10-28
2,"underwhelming, there is no support for landscape viewing on a tablet, despite the acceptable landscape viewing on the website? rather, it forces the app into portrait mode and it CANNOT be rotated into landscape. Will update score when proper attention for landscape view is supported.",2024-02-21
2,Please fix the sound issue where loads of videos are shown as GIFs / no audio. Well annoying,2024-03-17
2,"Too much suggested and sponsored content, just show me the subs that I actually joined.",2024-02-26
2,Left wing propaganda machine,2024-01-27
2,The new overflow menu when viewing pictures is HORRIBLE. You shouldn't press a button in the upper right and expect the options to appear at the bottom of the screen. That's just horrible UX. Did anyone think about this design?,2024-03-26
2,Difficult to navigate between comments and see parent comments.,2024-03-09
2,I have been using this app for a while now and out of no where it won't load saying unable to authentic. why the app tho? the website authentic me.,2024-03-17
2,I usually enjoy this app. But haven't been able to post in 3 days.,2023-12-22
2,What happened? Crashes everytime when I try to reply to a post.,2023-12-05
2,I kinda works but it's always buggy. It's lacking features that used to be found in API connected 3rd party apps that were put out of business by Reddit for the greed of the CEO.,2024-03-02
2,Each update is a fun adventure into finding what's been broken this time by the dev team.,2024-01-31
2,The app is generally fine. Not great but serviceable. The recent changes have made the content more homogenous and less interesting.,2023-12-02
2,"Bad performance and a lot of useless or downright harmful features. Swiping on the image slider often swipes to another view entirely. If I wanted to go to another view, I would choose it from the topbar explicitly. Same goes for the actual posts, nobody swipes from a post directly to the next one. They will come to the main page they were on, and scroll until they find a new interesting post. Also I don't care how many people are viewing the post or typing. Who would, and why?",2023-12-06
2,"New post navigation is absolutely worthless. The app can't tell a vertical swipe from a horizontal one, and there is no inertia to the comments section divider, meaning you have to drag it all the way, 3""-4"", down to the bottom of the screen, instead of grabbing it and flicking it down with a gesture, like it used to be. This is bad ux design worthy of being an example in textbooks.",2024-02-18
2,"If you like apps to update without fixing bugs (and often adding more), this is the app for you",2023-11-03
2,Terrible app being run into the ground by corporate,2024-03-22
2,"doesn't let links open in a separate browser, and there is no option to toggle that. no option to turn notifications off, so i keep getting updates from random sub reddits i don't care about.",2023-10-30
2,The app keeps logging me out. It seems random when it decides to do so. Developers need to look into this and see what is causing the issue. Also very slow loading.,2024-03-03
2,Absolutely hate using this app. The only reason I have it is because the web experience is horrendous. But my life is better without using the app so I try to stay away from reddit.,2023-12-12
2,I feel like a ghost on the app. No one sees my posts or comments.,2024-01-04
2,"Slow, buggy.",2024-03-29
2,How the heck did I download this app? Because I didn't do it. I don't want it I am uninstalling this app,2024-03-10
2,I only downloaded it for aita vids,2023-12-08
2,It reformats your question so it distorts it. Doesn't allow questions to search whole of Reddit so must choose subgroups may be inapplicable.,2024-03-09
2,Gr8 and stuff,2023-11-06
3,The only Re for 3 star is you cannot upload videos only gif,2023-12-12
3,I do like the dark theme as well as the custom snoos that show up when I look at My Subreddits. It also has a lot of the functionality of other than reddit apps. Now onto the bad. I find that it's lacking some of the functionality of other Reddit apps. For example I can't edit comments directly from my comment history or go directly to that comment (or at least I haven't figured out how). Edited 1/26/17,2024-01-10
3,"They keep asking me to rate the app, I'm only giving 3 stars due to the annoying nature of this repeated request. If it asks again, I will drop it to 1 star.",2024-02-09
3,"Im using an android12 phone... Cause of financial difficulties I cant buy a higher OS phone.... Is there no turn around for this ""runtime"" error? Thanks",2024-01-24
3,Top menu UI could be more clear.,2024-03-25
3,It's reddit.,2024-03-03
3,Pretty mediocre vs RIF is Fun. Simple example: Why do you pop up an NSFW warning on every page view that could be? why can't I turn that off?,2024-01-18
3,kinda confused how 2 use it how do i search tags,2024-02-25
3,Stop changing stuff :),2024-03-25
3,It's okay. I use it a lot. I am just reviewing cause I am tired of getting asked to review.,2023-11-29
3,App interface in south Indian dravidian languages pls. ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️. Keep updating pls. Android tv app pls. Inbuilt Google translations pls.,2024-03-17
3,"Fairly good. It's more clunky than it used to be, but I'm doing alright with that. I do think some changes should be made, though. The criticisms of the userbase should be recognized at least, to improve experience of the app and let others use it in a way that's preferable for them.",2023-10-31
3,Ohio marijuana dispensary and cultivation for this season was very interesting.,2024-03-09
3,"Nice but there are some things to improve on, BRING BACK 3RD PARTY API, give the ability to turn off infinite scrolling, change the UI so I can use image preview",2024-02-22
3,"really good, but a bit of a productivity kill.",2024-01-21
3,Love the stories. Hard to follow the comments as I'm not interested in people's replies to the comments but I have to go through them to get to the other comments. And I believe there shouldn't be a word limit when posting.,2024-02-09
3,Freezes and Crashes Often,2023-10-29
3,"I've spent a lot of time on reddit and made the mistake of updating it earlier this month. Now I can't even share posts with friends because they can't open them. Also, if I go to another app to respond to a text etc, it puts me back at the very top of the post and I have to figure out where I am again. I wish there was a way to go back to before I updated, the glitches are just ridiculous at this point. I hadn't had any issues in years and now it's every day.",2024-02-01
3,"Best social media and forum app I've ever use. However, the user interface is not so good, loading and response time is a bit lagging. Need improving on the interface.",2023-11-20
3,"Reddit is good but why is the app so goddamn broken? It stutters so much while basic scrolling bro, that too on a pixel phone, the most fluid android ever. Developers are so blind to android optimization lol.",2023-11-06
3,ELECTRIFYING,2024-01-03
3,"Awful in-app experience. posts take an eternity to load so do subreddits and accounts, everything.",2024-02-14
3,"I find this app intrusive. I have to navigate through several popups or unrelated content to get to the content I want. However, it is not as bad as Quora.",2024-03-11
3,Seems ok so far,2023-12-01
3,Starting like it,2023-11-11
3,It's good. I would like it if you could allow the user to add photos and videos to our replies to the subject. Others ask for photos in replies in a thread. We don't have that option. Thank you.,2024-03-13
3,Pretty good,2024-03-10
3,It's ok,2023-11-27
3,This app is not for kids,2023-11-12

3,Everytime I get a article in following sent to my gmail. I go and click on it and nothing happens!! Why does this happen??,2023-11-14
3,It's ok,2023-11-05
3,It good but chats take to long to reply,2023-12-27
3,"Videos are being played even when they're not in view port, so annoyed by that having to hear audio of video next in feed and still not visible, please fix it, it's bad user experience.",2024-01-26
3,I like the app but the only downgrade is the comment section in which can be quite confusing to follow up on each sub comments.,2023-11-12
3,Some crazy stuff on reddit. Lots of libatards,2023-12-03
3,"Glitchy! Posts get disconnected sometimes, ads play sound when not on screen and sound is off. Home feed is almoat as bad as instagram where is will refresh and never show you a post again. Welcome to social media.",2023-11-11
3,"Lately when I open a thread from a notification, all the comments are collapsed and I have to manually expand them to read them. Very inconvenient. Also, there's no way to easily get back to my home screen when I'm deep into several threads.",2023-12-06
3,Has gone backward for a while ...,2024-02-04
4,It's good for people to teach each other,2024-01-22

4,Nice,2023-12-28
4,"Overall, I like it. The scrolling could be smoother though. Also, if you are browsing a group that you haven't joined and return to the feed after viewing a post you are bumped back to the top of the list. It should remember your position.",2023-11-27
4,It's good. Getting used to new name.,2024-03-30

4,It's aesthetic,2024-01-25
4,"I've only been using it for a short time, but the app has been quick and easy to use. The organization of information is pretty good, though not ideal. It would be nice to be able to customize certain things more to my preferences, but I have no complaints so far, as it's really one of the better user interfaces out there and other social media platforms could learn a thing or two from it.",2023-12-14

4,Mass,2024-01-08
4,"Video seems to be an important element of Reddit, so the uneven video playback issue continues to be annoying. There was a period where it was smooth, but it's back to starting and stopping, which ruins some videos where continuity is important.",2023-10-28
