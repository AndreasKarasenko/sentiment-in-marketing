1.0,"I used this product about an hour ago. The foam is much to soft and will not reach the areas it should. It does not polish well at all. Grab your rags, polish, tin foil, and a can of elbow grease, do it by hand and you will be a lot happier.",1239667200,2009-04-14
1.0,"On the advice of a friend, I replaced my Toyota Tacoma's manual transmission gear oil with this Royal Purple Max. From the start, I encountered poor shifting and excessive gear noise. After two months the shifting got so bad, I opted to replace it with the previous gear oil I was using (Redline MT90). Now my shifting is back to being easier, with the gear noise gone... For the price of this oil it should have performed better than it did - I was very disappointed.",1286150400,2010-10-04
1.0,"I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks.",1395792000,2014-03-26
1.0,"I own a previous version of this jump starter. My was made by UST and not Wagan. The exterior is identical to my unit so I assume it is made by the same manufacturer. I normally recharge it every two months even if I have not used it to maintain a full charge for when I need to jump start a car. I forgot to charge it for about 5 months and the unit is completely dead. I have try to charge it but when you press the battery status button, you can see the voltage just keep dropping. I have try to recharge it several times and I think the battery is completely dead. The charger adapter is also dead. I measure the output voltage and it measures a little over 3 volts. I take special care of my adapters so I do not damage the wires. This unit was only used several times to add air to several tires. It has not been used to jump start. Overall very bad quality.I also have a Vector unit which is now Black and Decker and it also was not charged for 5 months. This unit still had two red lights which indicate it was in good condition. I recharge it for several hours and it came back with full power. I also own Jump and Carry JNC660 jump starter. This is a professional unit with 1700 peak amps. It can hold a charge for months and still show plenty of power. This unit is the best but expensive ($130). This unit can jump start big engines and completely dead batteries.One other general comment for those people out there assessing which jump starter to buy. These lower cost, lower peak amp starters are only good for cars that has a weak battery (i.e. as engine is slow to crank over). If your battery is dead where the engine cannot even slowly crank over, these starter will not have enough power to start your car so do not blame the jump starter as low quality. I see such comments in other reviews. For a completely dead battery, you need a more powerful jump starter such as JNC660. I have the same problem with my Vector starter which has only 300 peak amps. It also would not start a completely dead battery. That was the reason I bought the JNC660 and carry it in which ever car we own that has the oldest battery. I need to buy another jump starter (I keep one in each car) and am thinking of buying JNC300XL which claims to have 900 peak amp and is about half the price of JNC660. The reviews seem very good and is made by the same company.",1266364800,2010-02-17
1.0,"I now own 3 different trailer coupler locks that are &#34;universal&#34; They are not. I have a Jayco Jayfeather (2013) and the hitch is such (wide and high) that no locks fit it. As is the norm, this unit comes in the typical &#34;user unfriendly&#34; packaging that is destroyed upon opening. I'd be glad to sell mine to anyone interested in trying it out.",1374537600,2013-07-23
1.0,"I got a small construction staple stuck in my tire. Right on the tread, small holes. Exactly what this product is designed for. I followed the directions to a 'T', the Slime ""clotted"" in the hole and stopped the leak, and then I drove a few miles slowly to get the stuff well distributed in the tire. I measured the pressure over a few hours and it held. The next day I drove to work and when I came to my car that evening, the tire was flat. Lost pressure faster than when I had the staple in. It's been extremely cold here (Boston in February) and we've got a lot of snow, so my guess is that this stuff doesn't work too well in those conditions.I know people seem to have good luck with this, but I figured it would be useful to temper things a bit with the perspective of somebody for whom this product didn't work at all. Most importantly, watch out when using this in very cold weather.One more thing: if you look at the reviews you'll see that's it's pretty much either 5 stars (worked for people) or 1 star (didn't at all) with not much in between. It appears to work for about 3 out of 4 people, resulting in a pretty high average review (hence the four star overall rating). And that's assuming the Slime people are uncommonly honest and don't post false positive reviews. Put another way, THERE IS AT LEAST a 25% CHANCE THIS PRODUCT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR YOU. A 25% chance this will cause you far more trouble than if you'd just had the tire patched or used a more conventional tire sealnt, and that will make you deeply regret buying this. I'd actually say that for a product like this a 25% chance of failure is WAY too high. So, consider the 4/5 star review in that context. 4/5 might be a good rating for a TV, but for a product that is fixing something as important to your safety as a car tire, having a 3:1 ratio of five to one star reviews actually isn't that great.",1392940800,2014-02-21
1.0,The three year old Bosch wiper was squeaking because it'd turned stiff and wouldn't flip over on the opposite stroke. I replaced it with Rain-X. The wiper streaked along its entire length after installation when I used my windshield washer. I'd hoped that in a heavy rain it would clean up and work well. WRONG! It got worse and my visibility was so poor that I felt that driving was dangerous. Luckily I didn't have far to go before I could change it. I've always liked the Rain-X liquid so felt that I could trust the brand. Maybe I got a bad one but I've never had this happen with other brands. I won't chance buying these again.,1356134400,2012-12-22
1.0,"Used this tool to remove my fuel line on a fuel filter change...OMG I was under the truck for over a hour wrestling with it! Eventually the tool broke! What a piece of junk! I ordered the metal sissor one off of Amazon, got the fuel line off in 2 minutes!!! LITERALLY! I heard the click, and the fuel filter just came out! Save yourself some time and aggrevation...if you have a Ford truck, get the sissor tool, not this plastic junk.",1402876800,2014-06-16
1.0,"After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the ""frequently bought together deal"" including the 6.5"" finishing pad and the 6.5"" polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7"" which include a recess to make centering the polisher's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7"" pads are actually machine washable.  The Velcro pad is attached far more securely.  The older 6.5"" pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0""  or this older 6.5"" pad, it's just that Meguiar's has improved and updated their pads now.  The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad, that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0"" pad a no-brainer.  Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.Here are the links for the newest and improved pads:SOFTBUFF 2.0 FOAM POLISHING PAD 7 inchMeguiar's W 9207 7"" Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Finishing Pad",1351987200,2012-11-04

1.0,"I am disappointed on how well you can see through it. I bought it thinking it was mirrored, to be used as a sunblocker. This one is too see-through for my tastes.

1.0,"OK so these looked like they might be OK for the price and are made in Washington State (buy local thing).  I was terribly disappointed that a local Washington State company would claim these are waterproof (they know how it rains here).  These boots leaked buckets as the water ran off my waterproof riding suit pant legs right down into the upper part of the boots.  Within minutes of riding the boot was saturated.  The zippers also failed after about a week, the upper stop came off and the zipper just pulled right off in my hands!  Don't expect any support or protection from this boot either, it's front is sort of ""armored"" but the sides and the rest of the boot is very very thin material. Vega will not deal with any of these issues and say I must go through the dealer I purchased them from... however the dealer says they didn't make the boot or the claim of waterproofing so that's a warranty/advertising issue and to go through Vega. Catch 22 right?  If I ever get this resolved to my satisfaction (return for full refund) I'll post how much effort it took. For now I would avoid VEGA at all costs due to poor products and terrible customer service.",1322524800,2011-11-29

1.0,"I bought this bag due to the high ratings.  I received the bag yesterday and not really amazed by it.  It says leather ""Shell"" but I doubt it.  It doesn't feel or looks like a real leather to me.  It looks a lot rougher than it shows in the picture.The original plan was to put it on the fork on my 04' VTX1300c but it doesn't work.  I don't blame the bag because it clearly states that it is for handle bars.  But the bag is pretty big to go on the handle bars.  I could easily put an Arizona Ice tea can in it with some extra space.  So I ended up putting it on the back of the sissy bar.Pros:- Big- Sturdy- Low PriceCons:- Very stiff (like plastic stiff)UPDATE (9/17/2013)After using it for about 15 miles on the sissy bar, it scratches the pain of my fender because of the hard material they call ""Leather"".

1.0,"I was very disappointed with this product. I purchase this product based on the great reviews here. It says on the label it is a industrial and machinery cleaner. I am rebuilding a mobility scooter so i wanted to clean the grease out of the transmission. After draining the oil out of the transmission and dissembling it I soak the cases all night, tried different mixtures and it did absolutely nothing. Dawn dish washing liquid did a better job then this product. the residue justs smears but this chemical didn't dissolve any of the grease or stains.

It had a tuneup not long ago with new spark plugs, rotor, wires, etc and that didn't make much difference either so I have to assume maybe dirty or sticky injectors. I expected some difference based on the claims made for this Royal Purple fuel system cleaner but It made no difference at all. I cannot detect any difference in how the truck idles or runs.

2.0,"This is a very versatile system.  It can save a ton of work.  It is durable and solidly made.  It works as advertised, BUT: after a few uses, the unit started spraying used motor oil out of the top of the T-handle. What a mess! Used, black oil everyplace.  I called Mityvac and asked if there was some sort of replacement seal kit.  They promptly replaced the entire unit at their expense.  Great customer service, I was truly impressed.  Soon thereafter, the new unit started leaking just like the previous one.  Used oil everyplace! I was given no warning about synthetic oils when I called Mityvac (if this thing is incompatible with synthetic oils and fluids such as transmission, then I can't see what value it has).I own several vehicles and need a product which doesn't fail after 5 uses.  I did not contact Mityvac a second time as my warranty expired, rather have decided that the product may have a design flaw or unknown limitation.  I now wrap a wet rag around the T-handle to get a marginal temporary seal to start the flow and can still use the product this way, albeit somewhat ineffectively (and messily).",1356307200,2012-12-24
2.0,"Let me make one thing perfectly clear. I have a very nice shiny black luxury car.  I thought I'd check this system out to see if it would help me keep my car shiny and protect the finish.  The simple answer is - yes it will protect it but you won't like the way it looks.  I tested this on a small part of my car's hood first and it was difficult to spray without dimpling.  Then, once the finish is on, it makes my shiny black car look like it is covered with gray film - not at all what I wanted.  I think this may just be a problem with shiny jet black cars and may be less visible on other colors.  I think it would protect the underlying finish but you just may not like the way it looks.",1391990400,2014-02-10
2.0,"These wipers were installed on my Prius. I've had it for several years and the original wipers were just not cleaning as they used to.  I was surprised that this small car needed a wiper that was longer than the ones my 4 Runner uses.I'm not sure why, but the larger blade started to leave about 2 to 3 inches smeared in the middle of the blade. I have reinstalled it, used my old trick of diluted vinegar to clean the blade and the windscreen and it still does not do an adequate job. The smaller blade is working fine, but this larger one will definitely need to be replaced before the next few days of inclement weather.",1367366400,2013-05-01

2.0,"I waited for actual snow before writing this review, it's snowed about 3 inches so I unpackaged this unit donned my gloves and hat and set forth to clear my car. There are two clips on the unit where the handle is stored, unclipped the handle and adjusted for size. ( I have a small SUV) First setback was the units handle locking and unlocking system is tight and secure, really really tight and secure! After some grunting and twisting I got the thing set up. When tight, unlike the photo the scraper is at a 90 degree angle to the snow pusher ( more on this later). The foam snow pusher actually did a good job and cleared snow cleanly with no marring, it seemed to hold up to the usual edges and bumps from wipers, antennas, etc. and the length made the job quick.After snow removal I used the scraper end to get the light coat of ice off the windows. Because the foam pusher end is at 90 degrees to the scraper you end up trying to manage scraping with a wet 18 inch or so pusher end oriented up and down dripping icy water on you while trying to scrape horizontally. Trying to unlock the handle for storage with wet cold gloves was an exercise in frustration I managed it by sitting in my car for some leverage. Now I'm no weakling but I can't imagine a slightly built person or a lessor grip actually adjusting this thing on a cold dark wet icy morning with cold wet fingers.

2.0,"First, let me start off by stating that this is an un-bias review, I purchased this product from amazon, unlike many of the Amazon Vine product reviewers.Being an automotive technician with an engineering background, I can not for the life of me recommend this product to the general consumer. Make no mistake, as others have claimed, the build quality of this Item is great, but aside from the rest of the reviews, there is one aspect I haven't seen covered that MUST be addressed:The output voltage is way too high for any automotive installation application. after installing the solar array, I decided to take some readings to see what kind of output I was receiving, before finishing the install.First sunny day of April, 74degrees, and located in TN:Voltage: 24.2v in direct sunlightAmpere: 0.3Most 12v systems recharge at a voltage range between 13.2-14.7v via the alternator, or battery charger, Hooking this device in with a 24v output (even at low amps) can cause the battery to over-charge, the ecu to throw an over-voltage check engine code, or even worse, fry the ECU.devices such as lawn mowers, trolling motors, four wheelers, tractors, etc, that may not use or monitor battery voltage may be better suited for use with this, although I would not recommend charging even those batteries at such a high voltage.",1365292800,2013-04-07
2.0,"Amazon sent me a previously-returned ARB inflator and, not surprisingly, its hose leaked.  It was leaking from where the silver hose connected to the silver body.  I returned the ARB and bought a Milton Dual Chuck Tire Inflator With Gauge which uses higher-quality materials and higher-quality construction, though the ARB has a few advantages in design.The ARB has a gauge that's easier to read than Milton's.  The only problem is that the chuck on the ARB's air hose doesn't rotate like on the Milton, so you may need to clip the ARB's hose onto the air connector at an angle that makes the ARB's gauge hard to read.The Milton's chuck is open on both sides of the tilted silver end which I've read means you can push the Milton's hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.  Apparently this is necessary on certain vehicles and equipment.  If you don't need that feature, then the ARB's clip-on connector is probably more convenient.  The clip itself feels a little weak and might break over time, though if it did you could hold it against the air connector.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect.The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.",1354060800,2012-11-28

However, their turnaround time is more than two weeks, and I had to call their service department both times I had batteries replaced to get a replacement tire gauge.Furthermore, the batteries do not last more than a year or so, but I use tha gauge on a weekly basis for all my vehiclesRef. #2 : this appears to be due to the chuck design, i.e. the contact pin does notprotrude far enough to allow a positive seal on some valve stemsI am still searching for a digital tire gauge that allows the user to replace the batteries",1257033600,2009-11-01

Otherwise, it is decent quality overall make and digital readout.For another vehicle in our household, we have the Accutire MS-4355GB Programmable Tire Gauge, which is a better choice (although more expensive).

When you pull it out of the bucket, it really just drains off quickly, so you have to hurry and get it onto the car.  Also, it's white, so it shows dirt and grime very quickly as you wash.  I was surprised at how much grit and grime actually stuck to the mitt, even though I was using the 2-bucket method.  It just didn't wash off in the rinse water.  My old trusty microfiber sponge worked better than this mitt, unfortunately.  And the grit and grime rinsed right off the sponge, but not this mitt.

2.0,"I purchased a set of these for my 2013 Subie Outback...(26"" Driver & 19"" Passenger even though Amazon fitment said it wouldn't fit) and they fit perfectly. I've read all the reviews about the wipers not making contact with the center of the windshield but as far as my Outback goes they make full contact all the way across and are very quiet. I just got home (literally an hour ago) after driving in severe weather consisting of a mixture of ice, sleet and snow and I'm very happy with the performance. I'm not sure how long they will last but I hope to get at least a winter season out of them. In my opinion these blades might be better suited for windshields that are designed with very little curvature. I also have a 2001 Chevy Malibu and on many occasions over the years I've had to be very selective when purchasing blades because  of the inward curve of the windshield. So why only 4 stars?, don't know how long they will last. If I get a full season out of then I'll update my score.UPDATE 6/28/2013: I had to remove these wipers from my Subaru outback after a few months because they started making lots of noise while in the rain. I tried cleaning the blades multiple times and nothing worked. They continued to clean effectively but the contact noise was not tolerable. They are also slightly shorter than OEM and it was causing my Onboard Collision Avoidance System (Eyesight) to disable during rain because it would not clear lens area effectively. I re-installed the OEM wipers and all is well. From now on I'll stick to Subaru OEM wipers.",1360281600,2013-02-08
2.0,"I actually have the wash pads and they are not really effective because they hold so much water that they become heavy and cumbersome to use --especially on the side and lower parts of your vehicle.Also, they take forever to dry. One time I accidentally put them away in a container when I thought they were dry but the inside was still moist. The next day, they smelled like mold.You could toss these in the dryer but it would take forever to dry. When you leave them out to dry, they take a few days to completely dry before you can put them back in storage.As far as washing ability, I wasn't impressed. They don't lather up properly and I feel like every time I go over the paint, I am moving water around and not enough soap.My favorite car washing sponge is the Zymol sponge. You can get it for like 8 bucks on eBay. It is made from a higher quality sponge material, it is the perfect size, and it just makes car washing so much easier.  Microfiber is good for a lot of things but I think a good quality sponge is best for washing.  I actually like the sponge better than a sheepskin mitt (Griot's used to sell a superior sheepskin mitt which I have and still use.)I will admit that these micro fiber mitt's/pads look really cool and they feel great when they are dry but once you drop them in the water, they become so heavy that you can't efficiently use them. You might feel otherwise but I have a feeling if you use these, you will encounter the same problems I had.  IMO a good quality washing sponge/cloth should be lightweight when loaded with water and soap so that when you are washing your vehicle, you are able to produce lather.  This wash mitt/pad becomes so heavy when loaded with water that it is not able to effectively do that.I don't recommend this product to wash your car.",1308355200,2011-06-18

I wish is were twice the size for the price. Bamboo is actually a type of grass not wood.  Bamboo cutting boards are hard, plus the fact that they are very resistant to bacteria. Regular wood cutting boards, over time, get grooves in them where bacteria can get caught and transfer to food. This is especially true if the cutting board is not cleaned properly.You need to &#8220;season&#8221; bamboo cutting boards regularly &#8212; which can be time consuming. Seasoning will prolong the life of your bamboo cutting board. To season your board, first wash it with hot soapy water. Then, wait for the board to dry. Once it&#8217;s dry, saturate the board with food-safe mineral oil. Wipe the mineral oil off. Repeat this process at least 2 more times before using it for the first time. After that, you&#8217;ll want to re-season the board every month. You have to wash a bamboo cutting board by hand. It cannot be put in the dishwasher because there are more glued pieces that could come apart than with regular wood cutting boards. Bamboo cutting boards are more expensive than regular wood cutting boards. In fact, they&#8217;re among the most expensive cutting boards on the market today. Way too high maintenance for me.Some bamboo cutting boards are glued together with adhesives that have formaldehyde in them &#8212; which could eventually leak into and contaminate food. When buying a bamboo cutting board, make sure that it has a non-toxic label on it in order to avoid this.

Style O.D. Mechanics Tool BagThe fact that this connects directly to your vehicle battery is a plus. I've had other air compressors in the past that used the cigarette lighter however they can burn your fuse quickly. With a model that connects to the battery directly, there is no chance of burning out a fuse in your vehicle. Be sure to start up the engine before using this so you don't drain your battery though.for my usage, I probably could have gotten by with a much cheaper and lower powered Black and Decker model which plugs into the cigarette lighter without a problem. It would take longer and not be as enjoyable to use however would have saved me some hard-earned money.Another negative is that the battery jumpers on this are really small; they don't even fit over my entire battery terminals.

For any fluid change in a car, it's important to measure how much you take out so you know if you're putting enough back in (or if you got enough out).  Thus, buying a clear or translucent container with fill level markings would be a much better idea for most jobs.  Unfortunately I didn't think of that when I bought this.The wide opening is great but the lid is terrible and not water or oil tight.  It's also annoying to screw and unscrew as the part that joins the lid to the base will scrape past the handle of the container on every turn.Other reviewers said the plastic seems thin but I don't get that impression.  I currently have it full of 3 gallons of coolant and nothing's bending when I pick it up.  Maybe the manufacturing is poor and some end up thinner than others.",1397260800,2014-04-12

3.0,"I thought this would be a quick and easy solution to muffling the rattles emanating from a 1998 ford.  I was wrong. The product is a fairly hard black vinyl with an adhesive back.  Designed to be used on metal surfaces, it must be applied when temperatures are higher than 40 degrees farenheit. The surface must be thoroughly cleaned. The mat may be sized by cutting with scissors or in my case an exacto knife.The backer is removed and the mat is positioned.  Then ideally, the mat will fit securely and the offending noises muffled. If necessary you may use a blow dryer or heat gun.Sounds great. But it isn't quite so easy. First, it being winter in NY, I had to wait until the temperatures rose. I had planned to use this in a door. But the material is inflexible, cuttable, but still inflexible. Worse, I couldn't get it to stick in position. So I wound up taking it off. My brother then took the remainder for the back floor of his suv. He had better luck getting it to stick using a heat gun. He is satisfied with its noise muting capabilities.This product was not for me. Unless you are adept at accessing the offending parts and fairly handy, this requires significantly more work than the package suggests. When properly applied, it does seem to work. I wonder if the adhesion is effected by heat as well as cold. Obviously, the material becomes more brittle in the cold and does not adhere. Conversely, in high summer heat, does it melt or become gooey? I dodn't know.

It's probably the best option for anyone out there that actually uses their cd player or in a car that may not have one, but in general, the phone is set on the backend of the visor so makes it awkward to try to actually touch any of the buttons.  This shouldn't be a problem if you're using a blue tooth headset, but if you're one that likes to interact with it for GPS or anything else, it's an awkward reach.  The good news is that it fits just about any size phone be it small or large including Smartphones such as the Samsung Galazy, Iphone, ad Blackberry.  It would also accomodate old tiny phones such as the motorola razor.  The grip is firm and adjusting it is extremely easy.The final comparison is that if you have this plugged into the car charger, the cord is now hanging from your visor which is not ideal.

4.0,"**UPDATE I recently installed a set of these on a 2002 Subaru Forester. They are much brighter than OEM and other replacement bulbs as my previous review states on the other vehicles I have used these with.  HOWEVER the DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS NO LONGER FUNCTION by automatically turning on the low beam headlights when the car is turned on. To me this is not a problem, if one wants to drive during the day with their headlights on they can do so by simply turning them on manually. Just note that this may occur if you car is equipped with daytime running lamps.  Personally I prefer them as is and like the complete control of when my headlights are on or off and think exchanging FAR brighter bulbs for them being on automatically during the day is more than worth it, and again the price here on Amazon was much cheaper than in the stores, still think these are the best halogen bulb replacement deal out there.  Fast and easy way to make your headlights brighter.**Yes these bulbs are about as good as you are going to get with your stock headlights, they have a noticeable improvement in brightness over the stock bulbs, but don't expect too much. These bulbs have made the biggest improvement over stock among the various similar bulbs of which I have tried.  I like them a bit better than the Silver Stars for example.  The price here was very good and they basically did about what they were advertised to do.  I would recommend them.  However these or any other bulbs may not be enough if you have other issues such as the clouded headlight lenses. These are good halogen bulb replacements, they will be brighter than stock but not without clear lenses and not turn them in to HID brightness levels.  If you have old clouded lenses as well then using a headlight restoration kit will help a lot as well. I used these bulbs along with one of the Maguires headlight restoration kit with the Plastic X compound. My mothers 98 Toyota Camry had very weak headlights and I noticed the clouded lenses and purchased these bulbs to try to give her the best vision for night driving I could.  Especially important if one does not have the best night vision to begin with.  So that gave her clear lenses again which was needed for any new bulb to work better. This is about as good as one is going to get with a halogen bulb upgrade from all of those I have tried to date and they are very easy to install.  So a good improvement for the money as they are easy to change and inexpensive.It is easy to see the difference in brightness with these bulbs.  Just change one out and turn your headlight on shining on your garage door for example.  It should be obvious they are both brighter and whiter.  The easiest and cheapest way to make  your stock headlights brighter.  While I keep the bulbs I have replaced in the vehicle just in case one is needed in an emergency I have yet to have one of these bulbs burn out prematurely.  I have had them in one vehicle for 2 years and still working.  For about 25 bucks they are both a good deal and better than found at the local parts stores.If they are not bright enough for you just do not make the mistake of going to a plug and play type HID kit...See Below about that.The only real way to get an incredible improvement (3-4 times brighter) from your stock headlight housings is to do a PROPER HID retrofit.  But as for HID I want to make it clear that they are great and will be about 3- 4 times brighter than stock for sure and use less wattage as almost all run at 35 watts. BEWARE if you are going to go with HID's one should NOT buy an inexpensive ""Plug and Play"" kit that uses ballasts and HID bulbs that you stick in your stock halogen headlight housing. Doing so will cause the huge increase in brightness with no control of the beam pattern and while also illegal almost everywhere more importantly they will blind oncoming traffic and are a hazard will likely burn your reflectors in your headlight housings and are just a horrible thing to do period, no exceptions. HOWEVER there is a CORRECT way to upgrade to HID headlights which is known as ""retrofitting"" which means that you install projectors designed for HID bulbs. This is a great improvement and they have cutoff shields built in to the projectors so there is a very controlled but wide and bright low beam and super good high beam output. Doing this requires opening up the actual headlight housing and installing the new projectors and mounting the ballasts and new wiring harness. There is a place that sells these sort of kits for retrofitting and web sites dedicated to this subject. It is far from just plugging in a new bulb such as this so it takes a bit of effort or paying a shop that does HID retrofits to do this for you. Just a warning to those that think the cheap HID kits everywhere are not an option to even consider. Get the best halogen bulbs you can find or do a full HID retrofit. Don't make the mistake that just using a HID plug and play kit such as is commonly sold here and other places is a ""middle of the road option"". It is most likely illegal and never a good idea no matter how enticing the cheap prices seem.Use these halogen upgrade bulbs and if that is not enough for you then go all the way.  There are just way too many that go for these plug and play kits that are illegal and cause accidents that I want the message out that they should not be considered which many that are looking for brighter headlights such as those purchasing these bulbs could potentially consider.  If interested in HID try a web site forum like the HID planet for advice.",1307404800,2011-06-07

Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection.

4.0,"This Wagan power inverter is a great solution when those smaller power inverters for your car just can't supply enough power.  A good example would be if you need to run a printer or a desktop PC in your car.  Electronics really need clean power, and the Wagan provides a nice source of power that more accurately emulates the sinusoid of wall power.  That being said, do you need a 400W supply?

This is not a limitation of Wagan, but a limitation of your car.  If you intend to use your cigarette lighter only, then buy a smaller inverter.The one downside is that I noticed the internal fan is a little noisy, especially under heavy load.

4.0,"After observing that my Radio Shack test leads don't conduct electricity very well, I decided to upgrade to this set. Generally I have been happy with my purchase but the large number of small parts is a concern. Extech provides tiny dust caps for many of the conductive surfaces, which should improve their longevity. While these are a nice touch, they are likely to get lost.  Additionally, the base cables are separate from the probes and clips, creating 12 separate parts.  Adding the slim reach test probes, which would be purchased separately, there will be a total of 14 items in the case.It would take a longer time period to truly evaluate this product as the corrosion resistance of the surfaces along with the durability of the PVC cables will be the key indicators of value. Meanwhile, the cables and probes appear to be well made.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the flared design of the main probes can be less than ideal in tight spaces.  So, you might want to consider purchasing the Extech TL743 Slim Reach Test Probe Set at the same time.  Note the term ""set"" in the case of the slim reach test probe set is a bit misleading because there are only two probes without case or cables.  They will fit nicely in the existing case.The Extech TL809 Electronic Test Lead Kit is a solid value.  There is some room for improvement, such as integrated caps, but this would most likely come with an increase in expense and some additional limitations.  For no additional expense, Extech should include the slim leads in the base kit and make the flared probes optional.  At this price point, this lead set is highly recommended.ProsNice carrying caseComes with probes, alligator clips and plunger mini-hooksDust caps on conductor surfacesConsToo many small partsFlared test probes too wide for some applications",1321488000,2011-11-17

4.0,"I have been using a Battery Tender Junior for about 5 years on my motorcycle.  I always plug in the bike and it works great.I recently purchased the Battery Tender Plus to use on my Duramax truck (2 batteries).  It seems to work great so far.  I expect long life of the unit and the batteries just as I have in the past using this line of Battery Tenders.I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the short length of cable they give you.  The Junior's cables are so long that I can run that thing clear across the room.  The Plus' cables are so short that I had to splice in more cable.  They apparently don't expect you to charge your batteries in-vehicle with the Plus.By the way, the Plus brings my 2 very large batteries in my truck upto full charge in less than 8 hours.  They are new batteries and the truck's charging system works just fine and the truck is even driven almost everyday.  However, there is alot of parasitic draw on the batteries with the remote start / alarm system on overnite.  Combined with the 100 plus degree heat of the desert, the Battery Tender Plus is warranted.Of course I would not expect it to recharge my truck batteries if they were dead.  It is not designed to.  Make sure you look at the specs and know what you need.  I just needed a battery tender - something that would keep my batteries at full charge or restore the bit of charge lost overnite from the parasitic draw of the car alarm / starter.  By spec, the Battery Tender Plus cannot recharge these large batteries from dead.  Again, know what you need.  The tech folks at Deltran can help you with that.",1290816000,2010-11-27

Needless to say it fired right up.The battery was truly dead and would not take a charge whatsoever.Jumper cables from another &#34;smaller&#34; vehicle would not supply enough cranking amps to start my truck... but the JNC had power to spare.I have used it several times over the past year and a half since I made my purchase.

5.0,"I purchased this to haul extra cargo behind a Toyota Highlander and I'm glad I purchased it.  We just used it for a 1500 mile round trip and it performed wonderfully.  I used it in conjunction with a hitch tightener to guard against bounce and sway.  I also purchased the Rolo LED tail light assembly that fits this carrier.  It held a cooler and several suitcases in a cargo bag very well.I used a torque wrench for assembly as directed, and things went smoothly.  I think that mine assembled a little crooked - either that or the hitch is a little askew, which is totally possible.  Regardless, I'm very pleased with the quality and build of this carrier.It is light enough for one person to carry and install.  Probably easiest to set the bottom on the ground and lean the tongue up onto the hitch before lifting into place, but feel free to install it however you like.  If you're feeling sporty you could try a sideways javelin toss if you have good aim and a steady arm.I'd recommend this to you if you want to carry extra cargo without climbing up on a step stool or ladder to load a rooftop carrier.  This is easy to access and it doesn't wreck gas mileage either.UPDATE 3/12/14:  Still a five star review from me.  I've used this a few times in two months and it remains easy and solid on the back of our suv.  After putting it in and out of the hitch a few times, the paint has chipped off the edge of the hitch attachment, which is to be expected.  Otherwise, no rust, and this has been through several rain storms.  We are very glad we have this for extra cargo.  We are getting a hitch extender that will allow us to mount a bike rack above it so we can use it when we go on vacation and take our four bikes with us.",1389052800,2014-01-07

Easy to install these once I got the old ones off. I was surprised at the curvature of these Bosch blades but the spring holds the wiper blades perfectly against the windshield.

Even though the printed directions did not list my 2009 highlander, it was a perfect fit, and the photos matched my glove box.  When I compared this $9 TYC filter to the OEM original, I could not see any differance.  Note - the original OEM had an ""up"" arrow printed on it, but the TYC had an ""air flow"" arrow printed on it.  The filters, just like filters for you home furnance, have two differant types of sides.  One is a ""fuzzy"" side, and one a more ""frame like / structured side"". These filters have a fuzzy side, and a slightly rough plastic side.  When you pull the old one out, note which side is up and which one down, and put the new one in the same way.

I don't drive many miles and in the wintertime I like to charge my car batteries a few times during that season so I don't have an unpleasant surprise. This charger has a split leads design with one pair with traditional spring clamp ends. The other set of ends has eyes that can be bolted under the battery post clamp nuts on each post. This way you can install those eye ends on the car battery and then quickly attach the charger leads when you need to charge. nice design touch. It says it's designed in the USA but unfortunately it's manufactured in China. I would have happily spent a bit more to keep our guys in jobs in the USA, but I couldn't find an AGM charger made here. Anyway I tried it out on my new Optima and it works well - It also resurrected the old lead acid battery that was starting to lag a bit. That battery now tests out well also.",1305849600,2011-05-20
5.0,"I have read a lot about PureONE filters' great performance, and many seem to agree that it is the best filter for the money, although some argued it was too restrictive.  According to the marketing on the box, it filters 99% of impurities, which is better than any other filter in the price range and even some more expensive ones.  I decided to try PureONE PL14477 on my family's 2003 Camry LE 4-cyl and 2006 Highlander 4-cyl.The filter feels heavier and seems to have better materials and construction than the cheap filters the oil change shop slapped on my vehicles.  For example, when I grabbed with the filter wrench the filter that the oil change shop used, it separated at the seam where the can and the base of the filter meet.  However, when I was doing the next oil change I grabbed PureONE with the same oil wrench and it left just two small dents in the old filter.  PureOne has rough surface which make it very easy to install and tighten the filter even if my rubber gloves are a little oily.  I also like that it is bright yellow as the color makes finding the filter very easy.  It took me some time to locate the black filter which was installed by the oil change shop.I am not sure what is up with the price for PureONEs on Amazon.  Eleven bucks used to be the price for two, which was an OK deal, but now that's the price for one, which is almost double what PepBoys charges.",1283644800,2010-09-05

5.0,"I needed this to maintain a bunch of batteries although I have a few Battery Tenders already.  I use them because experience shows me they work and Deltran always stood behind their product when one went south on me while under warranty.  This year I took home the 3 boat batteries which were added to the two waverunner batteries and the motorcycle and the summer car.  This unit took care of the boat and the summer car and they work great as long as you buy the available entension lines so you can get them all out of your way and into the corners of the garage where you won't trip over everything.  One plug for 4 independent units is nice.  Easily worth the price if you need to regularly maintain 4 batteries and don't appreciate turning the ignition on next season and only getting silence or that weird clicking sound.  This is particularly painful on a boat when you're ""ready to go"".  Jump starting is not an option and what a hassle on the water - rutting around inside the bilge area.  Just turn it on and leave it alone.  The internal programming takes care of all the rest.TRUE STORY:I used my firt Battery Tender on my 1999 Porsche since new and only this year replaced the battery while having service performed and told it wasn't properly holding the charge - after 13 years.  That made me a believer for life.  Never have I had a battery last me anywhere close to that - not even half that.  New Porsche batteries are $200 +/- installed.  I will say that I did check cell fluid level annually and topped off with distilld H2O since it was a non-sealed battery from Germay (Varta?).
