1.0,"Loser. Expected something better from Whedon. Big fan of Firefly, the best tv series ever. Think he is desperate or strung out on drugs. Don't waste your time and money here.",1357171200,2013-01-03
1.0,Both the film and the subject. I've never seen a group of more dysfunctional and dangerous people ever. Not worth the time. Who wants to know about people of this ilk anyway. Yuk.,1397174400,2014-04-11
1.0,I have to agree with the rest of the reviews. They need to drop the SuR drama employees. Their annoying anyway. I absolutely love Lisa but her employees are making her look bad.Those waitresses are way fake wannabes.  People like that will lie and use people to get somewhere. Their dorks. I don't want to pay to watch a bunch of dorks when I can just go down to Hollywood and find them on the street there. I want to see a 100% full hour of BHHW drama. Not 80% Real Housewives and 20% dorks. It's fine if you want to do a show with just dorks but I don't want to be forced to watch dorkism.,1384732800,2013-11-18
1.0,"My title says it all.  Perhaps I just didn't have the patience to get further into the story but, after the heroine (wife of the main Viking prince) dispatches two rape-intent clods so neatly, I knew I was in no mood for fantasy.  Maybe episode two would have been better but I didn't care enough to sample it.",1389052800,2014-01-07
1.0,"I like the concept but the show is filled with totally unlikable characters. The humor is all based on uncomfortably weird characters... there can definitely be quirky, likable characters in a show but these aren't them. I understand this is supposed to be a comedy for ""mature"" audiences but there are plenty of mature individuals who get tired of F-bomb laced dialogue.",1366502400,2013-04-21

1.0,"I am too old and too un-cool to understand anything these techno-boobs were mumbling about in their hyper-tech-babble.They were all drinking Monster, double espressos or using Methamphetamines in some form and then yammering about everything in THEIR world (which is not my world hence NO frame of reference was found). I didn't give a tinker's dam about any of them or their insipid, vapid, banal and jujune lives.",1392249600,2014-02-13
1.0,"I'll be stunned if a worse movie comes out this year. If you liked Wicker Man and thought it needed to be slower, mix more genres, and be a bigger waste of time, then this film will be right up your alley. It's the kind of film that makes me rethink people's recommendations because if they liked this then we're most certainly looking for different things out of two hours of our time.",1346544000,2012-09-02
1.0,"How to tell when a movie is below budget cheap.(1.) No subtitles for either English or people with hearing problems.(2.) Intro that makes no intelligent sense to anyone with a high school or above educational background. NASA finds alien life forms in our solar system which have been identified as ""the writer's of  this movie"". NASA decides to bring said alien life back to Earth who start out looking remarkably like common wood decay fungi (e.g. Trametes versicolor) but then acquire the anatomy of an ocean dwelling cross between a jellyfish and a squid. Unfortunately for our alien writers who never passed 10th grade biology or 9th grade physical science the physics of this anatomy is mechanically unsustainable walking about on the surface of Earth.(3.) Handheld cinematography that looks like something your Neanderthal relatives took while touring deteriorating industrial, trash and natural disaster wreckage in Central America. Really really bad/cheap CGI on our poor stranded jellysquid. The jellysquid's agent should be fired or eaten.(4.) Actors with the emotional impact of the above mentioned fungi and the dialogue capacity of seven monosyllabic words per edited scene.(5.) Props in the movie consisted mostly of road signs that said ""Infection Area""; fungi on trees; army surplus gas masks; a crane to lift a truck then drop it which is edited to make it seem like the aforementioned jellysquid did it.(6.) Whale sound effects that unfortunately for our alien writers, had they spent $10 to hire a marine biologist they would have found out, that for the most part are of a frequency pattern that works primarily under water. Which brings up the question of what planet in our solar system did these creatures come from?(7.) It takes 45 minutes into this handheld travelogue before anything interesting happens and another 45 minutes to hope it ends quicker.",1296777600,2011-02-04

1.0,What a waste of good talented actors.  Story line was so weak the we didn't even make it through half the show. Totally bored out of my mind.,1391817600,2014-02-08
1.0,"Casting for main character all wrong.  Mediocre writing, very off base cop to gang relationship.  It seems as if they cast MR. Rogers to be the bad ass, almost impossable to believer.",1384387200,2013-11-14
1.0,"Publicizing a movie is very expensive but here in the guise of honest viewer reviews, false advertising with faked praise reviews by those who have a connection with the films, it's FREE.",1404259200,2014-07-02
1.0,"Video; acting; storyline; script all of  a quality of a high school film class student production. Just goes to show that anyone with $500 for an HD camera can produce a waste of time video. No humor unless, again high school crude was the high light of your education; no story other than three weeks (boringly noted with day 1. day 2, etc. superimposed) of a few people in a house just drinking, talking and acting stupid. The only ghostly thing was the usual door opening/closing and a bed sheet raising (someone was under it and it was suppose to be a ghost) - that's it.All the five stars are probably connected to the video.",1390262400,2014-01-21
1.0,"I don't know why this show is popular,  it's not good. I thought it would be like Merlin from BBC, but it's not. It's about teenagers. It's way too shallow for me.",1394928000,2014-03-16
1.0,I couldn't get through it...too slow and too dark (content)...didn't hold my attention! Might try it again later but not sure.,1397779200,2014-04-18
1.0,Total- TOTAL C- Movie!I plead that you listen to all the 1 star reviews.  They are not lying!!!  OM Triple GGG!!! This movies gore is not even C minus worthy.  There is none. Sad that the  movie trailer has you  thinking otherwise.  I sat through almost half the movie before I had to turn it OFF.  The folks who are rating this movie 5 star must be part of the filming and acting crew.  Great premise but the monster is throw up ridiculous looking and my gag reflexes would not stop and not because of the movie.  More due to the symptoms of actually paying to see this BEFORE SCHOOL special. Best bet- save your money for an adult horror flick not some third grader pop tart and marshmallow roasting affair.,1404172800,2014-07-01
1.0,"Wow what a terrible show...I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with ""unfunny"".It's geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way...just in a bad way.  Bad acting, casting, scripting and on and on.",1190419200,2007-09-22
1.0,"This was a poorly written waste of time.  I only watch a few minutes, hoping it would pick up but it never did.  There was no dialogue, no basic story line, just endless trips to the &#8220;potty.&#8221;  Bobs girl",1400112000,2014-05-15
1.0,This show I would never watch. I did not like it at all. that is not to say its bad just bad for me. enjoy and watch if you like it just leaving my review.,1392336000,2014-02-14
1.0,"OK so naked butts we can take any time as long as there is a good story somewhere... But this show was lost btw naked boobs, butts, addictive behaviors for spoiled people..... (yup those with way too much time on their hands and way too much money)....There is bad and then there is really bad... This is a thumbs down, kill, erase from our memories bad.",1391990400,2014-02-10
1.0,It sucked as a movie. The sound was scratching in spots well a lot of spots but I don't think that is Amazons fault. Withing minute from the start you knew the entire movie before it happened.,1363651200,2013-03-19
1.0,I usually like the paranormal shows but this one was just bad.  The Wraith how bad can an interview be?  The whole story and the acting was very much lacking in everything.  Definitely not worth spending time watching and I want my 1.99 back.  This is the first time I really disliked something bad enough to write a negative review.  Don't waste time...there are much better shows out there.,1379721600,2013-09-21
1.0,"The pilot episode is funny because its audacious and over-the-top redneckery, but shortly thereafter it becomes a droll, uninteresting show about this stupid family of fakes pretending to be beverly hillbilly like backwoodsmen, new to fame and fortune because of a popular duck call, having fun in their hemi trucks and shiny new carharrrrrrt attire.  I would have a real problem with the publicly bigotted statements if it weren't simply a pandering to an audience of morbidly obese neckertown walmartians and a  false flag of 'any-publicity-even-negative-is-publicity-nonetheless' as a dubious means to perpetuate a WELL overplayed merchandising campaign at Walmart that is as stupid as the people who buy into it.",1399248000,2014-05-05
1.0,10 mins = nothing20 mins = nothing30 mins = yawn... what time is it?40 mins = nothing45 mins = oh- wait a minute... is something happening!?!47 mins = nope  :(55 mins = left the movie running while taking a bathroom break.65 mins = mind actually started drifting off thinking about my morning commute to work.75 mins = I give up.skip it- you won't regret it!,1383696000,2013-11-06
1.0,"I loved this show but Abbey is going over the top.  Her behavior is bordering on emotional abuse and bullying of children.  People were outraged over last Tammi on last year's season of Basketball Wives.  Abbey is getting pretty close and she's pulling her antics on CHILDREN.  What kind of example is being set for them??? Is this like Lance Armstrong syndrome, that you do whatever to win???? That they have to be in abusive situations to be on a winning team?  I'll have to pass on this show from now on.  I can't condone children being in this environment.",1358380800,2013-01-17
1.0,"The first 20 minutes or so the dialogue and acting led me think that a creative, well written and produced haunted movie was in the works. Wrong! They either quickly ran out of writing inspiration or money or both. It quickly fell into a cheap formulaic abyss. The rest of the movie moves like redundant molasses.Proof?(1.) Well, lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over.(2.) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound. Duh, digital has been around for decades and, anyway, they have a limited frequency and amplitude range, so what's the point.(3.) Usual, couple of guests that add nothing to the story and you're left wondering why they were even in the story. Well, one guy decides to slit his wrists, in a bathtub, of course.(4.) Usual, mysterious sounds - well, they are in an old hotel!(5.) The usual mysterious self-closing door. Actually, a prop person standing behind and pushing it. Scary!(6.) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn. Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes.(7.) Usual chain locked cellar door.Spoiler follows:(8.) Usual girl starts imaging ghosts and locks herself in the basement to subsequently die of fright complications thinking a ghost is chasing her but it's her co-worker banging on the door.",1336521600,2012-05-09
1.0,"This series is not well done there is no explanation to what is going on, what is that thing? Unatural, religious, ET?I just do not want to watch something religious, so I just think this is not for me.",1393891200,2014-03-04
1.0,I tried to give this pilot a chance just like I did with a few of the others and this one did something that the others did not...bored me from the beginning.  The show &#34;The After&#34; and &#34;The Rebels&#34; caught my attention from the very beginning while &#34;Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street&#34; lost me immediately.  The writing wasn't as great as the other shows and while Fionnula Flanagan is quaint as Miss Hudspith and Robyn Lively is more beautiful than ever the rest of the show has its flaws.  The children in the show don't have the ability to deliver the so called &#34;punchlines&#34; and there is just no chemistry.,1394064000,2014-03-06
1.0,"Yes, 9/11 was horrific and for those of us who were not there I'm sure we can't imagine. I began watching this on 9/11/13 just to remember what had happened, part of the way thru I had to turn it off because the descriptions and so forth were so terribly graphic that it was disturbing. Don't watch this movie if you are sensitive to very graphic descriptions of the horrors of that day.",1379462400,2013-09-18
1.0,"Update: I have to laugh at the people who found this review ""not helpful."" They think everyone has to agree with them.  Still don't want Hollywood imposing their political views on everyone.If this show took on both political parties I might have watched more than 15 minutes of it. I don't want politics in the shows I watch.",1367107200,2013-04-28
1.0,"The series started out OK, but after three episodes, I lost interest. Hard to figure out just what the point is and how the characters interact. Not much suspense, particularly at end of episodes to keep the viewer coming back. Yawn.",1401494400,2014-05-31
1.0,"Yeah, I know it is a cartoon but still it conjures up he real thing when I watch it. i only watched part of the first episode. Had to stop since I did not enjoy the subject manner and also the style of the cartoon was not on par with my other favorites. Just was not interesting to me.",1371168000,2013-06-14
1.0,Characters that grate and dialogue that annoys rather than entertains. Is this a comedy because a man in a dress is supposed to be funny (it's not)? Let's hope this one doesn't make it past the pilot.,1392163200,2014-02-12
1.0,Very disappointed wouldn't recommend it at all! It downloaded good but other than that it isn't worth any ones time!,1401408000,2014-05-30
1.0,"Much of the current cast is unlikable: the two new ones are 1) crazy, and 2) bland; and I would like to see the pretentious and over-bearing Heather booted as well; her arrogance and sense of entitlement has become incredibly annoying. I think Heather has exerted too much influence over this show because she is Jewish and so are the show's producers, and that is one tribe that sticks together. Heather pretends to a kind amiable character that she does not possess; she has now twice kicked another cast member out of her house when her or her husband's comments rebounded back on them (and who can forget the infamous ""intervention"" Heather staged when she viscously blindsided Alexis while on vacation). I miss Alexis too; maybe she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but she had a good heart (more than can be said of Heather), and Alexis is the greatest beauty that has appeared on any of these house wife shows. I think her beauty is why Heather was so jealous of her; that, and the fact that she is pointedly Christian and Heather is Jewish. I strongly suspect that Heather had Alexis blacklisted. Apart from being eye candy, it was fascinating to watch as Alexis fought for parity in her marriage. They should bring Alexis back. I don't think I can stand another season of Shannon; she is bat s*** crazy (0f course, I'm sure Heather will have her fired anyway). The other new one is just a bland version of Alexis, who knuckles down to Heather (as much of the cast is now doing...where are Tamara's smart aleck wisecracks?  She keeps her mouth shut because she's scared of Heather and of the power she wields over the show). I don't think I'm going to continue to watch with the current cast. Besides, they are so scared of Heather that they cannot be themselves.",1402790400,2014-06-15
1.0,"Honestly here guys, overall this things getting 4 stars with an overall of 33 votes so far? Come on, who are you kidding? Every other site slams this movie with honest reviews, IMDB has this as 4 of 10 stars with 673 votes. Put two and two together here folks. You saw the trailer right? If not, go see it, and you will know this movie is going to be horrible just from watching that. Horrible acting, bad editing, dodgy sound, ugly lead actresses, dumb plot, and made by two girls no one I know has ever heard of. What where they popular on a public access show they produced in a town that all 32 residents living their watched it? So why is there reviews here praising how much they love them? Sounds to me like one of the following possibilities.1 - One or both of the twins wrote a review or two here.2 - Some pervert just heard it was female twins and went nuts obsessing over it.3 - Friends of friends of friends... you know, ""like my movie on facebook guys!!!""4 - It's just a bunch of jokers having a stupid laugh.5 - Drunk or mental conditions apply to the reviewer.6 - Watched the wrong movie.Add a 7 if you have any more thoughts :D",1403395200,2014-06-22
1.0,"this was quite possibly the most annoying movie ever.""Dumb"" is too smart for this movie!This movie makes the Blair Witch look like a 5 star movie!I actually wanted to put my head through a wall- that's how stupid this movie is!80% of the movie is a camera being dragged through brush and trees.worst script logic ever! IT MADE NO SENSE!  nothing was even remotely realistic or logical!If this was a film about how to make the worst decisions ever while being hunted by a murderer- then it's the best movie ever! lolThis movie was so bad it's hard to give examples- I'm so sorry.I will never watch a movie by this director ever again.I'm sorry that I sound like a broken record... it's just I can't believe how gawd awful this film was!",1394668800,2014-03-13
1.0,Not as good as I had hoped.  Seems to have lost its appeal to me.  The only thing that I like in it is that Kat and her boss are a good fit.,1390953600,2014-01-29
2.0,"Deadfall is a white noir, instead of being told in the shadows of the mean streets of the corrupt city, it takes place in the wide open snow covered wilderness. It is easy to identify that Deadfall wants to conjure up memories  of Fargo  or any other Cohen brothers movie for that matter, but ends up simply stuck a drift in it's own snow storm of tedium. This isn't a bad movie, per say, but it is middling, predicable and more often than not, dull. Which comes as a shame because the movie has a real great cast that is game for something more meaty.Telling the story of Addison (Eric Bana) and Liza (Olivia Wilde), a brother and sister team that just stuck up a tribal Casino. A car wreck leaves their driver dead and them stranded in the cold Michigan wilderness heading for the Canadian border.  They become separated and Liza hooks up with a stranger, Jay (British actor Charlie Hunnam), an Olympic silver medalist pugilist just out of jail and already on the run again. He wants to go home for Thanksgiving, but they end up stuck at a roadside motel for the night. She pretends he's her brother and he pretends she's a playboy centerfold, and somehow through all this they fall in love.Also add another subplot involving small town cop Hannah Becker (Kate Mara), trying to prove herself in a man's world and dealing with daddy issues involving the local sheriff (Treat Williams), who may be her father, but he is also a sexist, arrogant lout.Deadfall starts off very well with a great hook, but as it goes along it becomes tiresome and conventional. The early cinematography by Shane Hurlbut is excellent with a nicely done car crash and an exciting chase on snowmobiles, but like everything else in this movie becomes more pedestrian as it trots along.Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, an Austrian born director who won an Oscar for 2008's the Counterfeiters, making a very mild mew English language debut. Working from a half backed script by first time screenwriter Zach Bean, who manages yo fit more clich&eacute;s in a ninety-five minute movie than just about anyone this year. Bean's script seems cobbled together by bits and pieces of other movies, and not necessarily there best parts. It's plotting, it is rushed and there is little or no character development.Deadfall manages to almost descend into self parody with it's obvious and contrived ending that feels like the old Humphrey Bogart movie Desperate Hours, which itself was remade by Michael Cimino and starred Mickey Rourke, with a very special Thanksgiving twist. A holiday showdown in the snow.A very good cast is all that keeps this afloat. Eric Bana is superb in the central role, a tough guy villain that is easy to root for. Olivia Wilde proves she's much more than merely eye candy here, she is sweet, scared and sympatric in the role, she makes Liza simply more human, and this could be Wilde's best work so far.Kate Mara is excellent as rookie police officer Becker, she's smart and tough with the offbeat charisma that Mara is good at exhibiting. She's pretty, but not glamorous, and gives a clich&eacute;d role a more firm footing in reality, or at least she makes it appear so.Charlie Hunnam is just okay as Jay, a poor man's Tom Hardy the role is so underwritten that the actor is given little time to do much of anything, he's just there as the movie's handsome stranger, a rather dull protagonist.Add reliable veteran performers Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spaceck as Jay's folks, and Treat Williams as the sheriff, this highly capable cast really cooks. Unfortunately it adds up to more of a cold lunch than a holiday feast.Deadfall is a slight and unmemorable thriller, it's laughable in all the wrong ways and doesn't add up to a impressive Thanksgiving themed movie. Although it would be interesting to see what happens after diner, I mean some people have some explaining to do that could have added up to something more interesting than what we have here. This time of year you can do better. Give the gift of love and take some you care about to see something else.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1362441600,2013-03-05

2.0,"Now I know that anyone can make a movie.  The grainy black and white filming was interesting, and really didn't add to the movie.  It's like they said &#34;We'll save money if it's not in color&#34;.",1379116800,2013-09-14

2.0,"'The Canyons' is one of those films you hear about, that is so bad that you have to see for yourself. Plus, it was supposed to be the comeback of Lindsay Lohan. What I kept thinking when I saw Lindsay Lohan was the amount of bruises on her legs that were apparently not covered by make-up. It was sloppy, and that is exactly what the film is, sloppy.What we see is the underbelly of Hollywood. The scummy, seamy side. A young, would be starlet, Lindsay Lohan, being kept by a millionaire porn star. Sex with differing couples, or with men whom the porn star has promised a night with Lohan. The plot is thick with wanna be's and with actors working as waiters and bar tenders, selling and playing with sex and drugs on the side. Everyone seems to be a little 'off' is it the drugs or are they all mentally ill? No matter, thus is not a good film. I am not sure if it ever made it to the big screen. Lots of hoopla, where nothing delivers.Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 11-05-13",1383609600,2013-11-05
2.0,"OMG, this is almost un-watchable. I don't understand. Big name folks involved. $$ spent on effects and sets. You've begun with an interesting premise. But the story is garbage. Recycled garbage at that. Pushed along by hopelessly cliched dialogue. How sad. Who is the target market? Why is the leader doing an ""Aw shucks ma'am""/Marshall Dillon impression? There is no chemistry between the husband and wife. The sullen misunderstood teenager plot line has been done to death. Let it rest in peace! I guess I answered my own question. The target market are kids who are too young to recognize the cliches. To them it's new stuff. Okay... Well, I'm going to watch a Firefly episode to cleanse my pallet.",1319328000,2011-10-23
2.0,"All the parts were there for a truly fine series.  Good actors awesome budget...  well ok maybe not all the parts.  The story lines while interesting were executed poorly and the special effects just didn't do justice to the show.  What really stuck out to me as unacceptable were the fight scenes.  Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new ""strength"".  In the fight scenes she couldn't fight here way out of a wet paper bag.  One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise, no broken bones nothing.  When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing.  She can take a punch better than ALI ever could.They say the writers strike condemned this show to one season.  I really doubt that.  I would not purchase a second season.",1381363200,2013-10-10

2.0,"This series is about what's wrong with America.  A Popeye's employee, who should have been fired on the spot, is given a ""mentor"", and put on the fast track to becoming a trainer.  It's probably all a big lie, but maybe it isn't.  Employees who work hard and do their job see other employees who are terrible get away with it, so why work hard at your job?  After watching a few episodes, I do think it's all fake.  There's a guy who walks an hour each way to work, so Popeye's gives him 10 grand to buy a car.  I'd have given him $20 to buy a used bike.  He can't figure out to car pool with someone, take the bus, or get a bike?  Give me a break.  I've worked lots of jobs.  I haven't seen lots of people who work real hard, but don't get recognized.

2.0,"Margot (Michelle Williams)meets Daniel (Luke Kirby)and the two feel an intense and immediate attraction. But Margot is married to Lou (Seth Rogen), a cookbook writer and tries halfheartedly to resist. Margot seems bored by her domestic happiness with Lou. She craves excitement. As luck would have it, Daniel and Margot live across the street from one another. After over an hour of teasing, including a blow by blow verbal account of what Daniel would like to do to Margot, they succumb. Margot moves in with Daniel and they have hot and heavy sex including threesomes of various kind. But by the end of the movie, Margot is just as bored with Daniel as she had been with Lou.It sounds like the makings of a pretty good movie but this is so exploitative and unpleasant that watching it just becomes a tiresome chore. One scene in which we see a bunch of naked women in a swimming pool shower had me particularly puzzled. As well as the lovely bodies of Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman, we see a bunch of older bodies, sagging breasts, pendulous breasts, flabby tummies, wrinkled backsides. What is this for? Is it to remind us that youth is fleeting and age will catch up with us all? Do we need reminding? It seemed just gratuitous and almost cruel to me.The fleeting glimpses of Margot and Daniel in three-way sex were also like peepshow parades. Who does that kind of stuff? These seemed like two nice normal people. The filmmakers had a message and by golly they were going to get it through.For the first hour of this movie, there was a kind of slow-burn eroticism.

2.0,"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction.  When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety.  It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes.  When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing.  Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two.  I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases.  Personally, I didn't agree with the decision--but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included.  Anyone who read the box knew what to expect--how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Not so for ""American Restoration, Volume One!""  I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside.  Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package)--it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting.  I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics?  I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information.  My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base.  I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!I, however, will tell you what is inside.  The 2 DVD set has sixteen episodes:  all four from the abbreviated Season One and the first twelve from Season Two.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were sixteen episodes on the DVD box?Season One: (1) Hopalong Rock, (2) Ice Cold, (3) Lights Out, and (4) Buttered Up.Season Two: (1) Cooler Kings, (2) Knockout, (3) Duck and Cover, (4)Pumped Up, (5) Space Kowboy, (6) Jackpot, (7) Safe Keeping, (8) Suck Up, (9) Rev'd Up, (10) Apples and X-Rays, (11) Hot & Cold, and (12) Secret Fan.Actual Review:I will be brief in my actual review since I already went on a tirade.  ""American Restoration"" is an offshoot of the popular ""Pawn Stars,"" and fits comfortably into the History Channel's stable of reality based programming.  Its star (Rick Dale) made semi-regular appearances on that program, but now we get a closer look at what he does.  Based in Las Vegas, Dale and team locate objects that might be of value (or represent lost bits of Americana) and figure out ways to restore the item to its former glory.  It's an easy show to like and fascinating especially if you enjoy antiquing or modern day treasure hunting shows (Pawn Stars, Storage Wars and others).  I found it very interesting to see the different techniques of this unusual art form--and I do think Dale is an artist!  The program itself merits four stars.  KGHarris, 11/11.",1320537600,2011-11-06

This felt stale and uneven. It was interesting not knowing what was going on, but there were a ton of logic flaws with how things were being handled. The chaos outside of the parking garage seemed contrived and unbelievable. Had a day already past without communications, there would have been better organization and people would not have been walking around like zombies. It made for a nice visual picture, but was unbelievable. Also, if a day had past outside, why was it never addressed again? Shouldn't more time have past when our protagonist returned to the garage? The acting was good and the show looked spectacular, but the story needs help.

3.0,"A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if  death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body/mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended? That's a good question that I don't have a glib answer for . . . those considering an intervention? Substance abusers? Those interested in human behavior? Perhaps one episode if you are interested in finding a few answers to your own questions.I've viewed 'Chasing The White Dragon,' 'The Global Addiction,' 'Afghanistan: The Opium Trail,' and 'One Man's Seduction.'  If you have an interest in grower to user, 'The Global Addiction' is a 30 min overview by ABC Australia, that is well narrated and reasonably accurate.[Season 10 review]",1398988800,2014-05-02
3.0,"THis is a somewhat low key, hard scifi film.  It doesn't go for cheap thrills or preposterously silly outcomes, but instead follows a mystery to the end with few frills.  That being said, there is plenty of action and legitimate fear, the joy of discovery, and realistic tensions and relationships within a team that lives in close quarters for a long time.  It is well done.As with many goods works of scifi, there is a mystery that must be solved that is essentially scientific.  Beyond the question of searching for ET life, you have to wonder what happened to the mission.  Their work is extremely dangerous, which is very well portrayed, but their inspiration and mission propel them forward.  I liked the way that the recovered transmissions were put together in a kind of retrospective documentary that reveals what finally happened in tiny bits, saving the most significant for last.THough there were few known actors, I also thought the acting was well done.  It's just that they were techies and scientists, whose concerns were rather recondite, but whose passion is apparent.  They bonded as a team, cared for each other, and felt losses very keenly.Overall, I would recommend this for renting but not purchasing - you probably won't want to watch it more than once because it is so low key.",1386633600,2013-12-10

3.0,"Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) a novelist with writer's block after the tragic death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish)  decides to get away to their summer place by a lake.

But the ghost of a dead singer, named Sara Tidwell (Anika Joni Rose) also starts to communicate with him their through an old recordplayer.He also finds himself in the middle of a custody battle between a widower, Mattie (Melissa George) and her evil father in-law Max Devore (William Schallert) when he saves Mattie's daughter from getting hit by a car. Since Max is a powerful man, he wants to bully Mike into admitting that Mattie is a bad mom and that she wasn't watching her child. In-order to help Mattie's daughter, like Jo wants him to, Mike must discover the town's dark secrets.The film is a decent adaption of the Stephen King book, but that's all director Mick Garris, is capable of, either decent adaptions, like this and the Stand or really bad ones, like Desperation. What makes Bag of Bones only decent is that it just moves along slowly with Pierce Brosnan acting pretty casual about being haunted or the other strange happenings. Melissa George acts pretty casual about the strange things going on as well. The director, takes an interesting story and manages to make it kind of dull and not even scary.I think a more talented director could have got better performances out of Brosnan and George since they aren't bad actors. Garris should only be handed King adaptions that weren't big successes. For instance, he needs to be kept away from the Dark Tower, Under the Dome, Duma Key, Insomnia, the Talisman or anything else that has potential as a movie or mini-series.",1326067200,2012-01-09

3.0,"""Rome"" is almost like two different productions smashed together. One of them is a classic well-acted account of the politics and history of Rome in the days of Ceaser. The other production involves ""history of the common people"" and enough graphic sex 'n violence to get a mass audience to watch it. The first production would get five stars from me but the other would get one star. So in the end, it gets three.At the top of the production, there is an excellent cast playing out the classical story of Julius Ceaser from the point where he decided to return from Gaul to his assasination in the senate. The portrayal of Ceaser is incredible. Its really able to get across the concern about what Ceaser's intentions really are and how he is using everyone around him. The other characters in the civil war are equally well done. Pompey is rightfully portrayed as Ceaser's equal rather than a fool or a loser. The personalities of Mark Anthony and a very young Octavian perfectly set up the inevitability of what is to come. The only character whose portrayal fails is Brutus. Rather than an idealistic leading man of Rome, Brutus is written as an immature fool. The writers were obsessed with making Brutus the scorned illegitimate child of Ceaser and explaining everything about the historical character from that point of view. It doesn't work at least for me.Attached to the production is a modernistic ""everyman"" history in the form of two soldiers. They are supposed to weave into the plot to show the lives of everyday romans. But for me, it doesn't really work. They are inserted into key events in every episode in really clumsey ways. Having one of them trigger the civil war and then later be the actual father of Ceasar's child by Cleopatra is just silly. There is also an adultery plot that runs the entire season that just isn't very interesting. It would have been better to ditch the two everyman and bring in character actors for single episodes to play the roles that common people might play in the plot. Both actors are excellent though. They are actually playing far above the material they are being given.Nobody can deny that violence was a part of Roman life. Where the production gets it wrong however is when it does ""look at me"" sorts of sex and violence that don't in any real way advance the plot and are just there to draw in a certain kind of audience.The accurancy of its portrayal of ordinary Roman life is up for question anyway. The reason most productions on rome focus on the top layer of society is that we have books from the period written about those people. We don't have much as far as accounts of common rome go and all too often, archelogy combined with imagination gets substituted for solid history. And all too often, the view of sexuality in roman society is based on a couple writers who wrote tabloid style scandal material either for the political opponents of the elite or for the people in every age who consume such things.Properly edited down, ""Rome"" would be a first-class production. As it is, like most of the material funded by HBO its flawed by an attempt to draw in a bigger audience through salting in lots of sex 'n violence.",1172016000,2007-02-21

Nor is it a &#8220;drama&#8221;.So, what is it?For lack of a better term, I&#8217;ll call it an interesting &#8220;light drama&#8221; about the world of gambling.Adapted from the best-selling memoir by Beth Raymer, the story centers on &#8220;Beth&#8221; (Rebecca Hall), a former Florida stripper who travels with her dog to Las Vegas and winds up working for &#8220;Dink&#8221; (Bruce Willis), the owner of a small-time sports gambling enterprise.Beth and Dink soon discover that she is good with numbers, and the business begins to thrive until Dink&#8217;s jealous wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives on the scene, forcing the younger woman to quit Vegas and travel to New York with her new boy friend (Joshua Jackson) and go to work for a shady gambler (Vince Vaughn).  Unfortunately, in New York, gambling is illegal, and before long, Beth must call on Dink to help her out of a sticky situation that can land her in prison for a long stretch.Stephen Frears directed this entertaining film.The Blu-Ray release from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes several deleted scenes.

Being a found-footage film, &#8220;Europa Report&#8221; tells the story of six astronauts, using images of head cameras and monitor cameras in a spaceship, as well as talking heads scenes.The film is very unique and ambitious in its effort to stick to realism, using the found-footage format that has become very familiar to us. While the method manages to visually enhance the reality of the film, especially its claustrophobic atmosphere, it inevitably makes the film reliant on dialogues that are often heavy and not always interesting.But I think the biggest problem is the film&#8217;s storyline itself. The idea of a privately-funded spaceship travelling to discover the evidence of extraterrestrial life is not something that I can believe, especially when the film makes almost no effort to make us care the characters and their mission. Why should we, if they find something or not? Also, the film&#8217;s jumbled timeline does not help.Of course, I see the point of the film, a science fiction movie that is scientifically accurate.

Plenty of us have seen the real deal. You can't have people driving vehicles through crowds of people and shotgun fire-fights without carnage.",1393286400,2014-02-25

3.0,"We watched the entire first season because we like the premise and Kevin Bacon .... but somehow the show does not add up to the sum of its parts.Instead of serious and threatening, it comes across as repetitive and annoying after awhile.What is &#34;off&#34; with the show ?We think we have identified what keeps us from liking it more .......... it seems the show just &#34;churns&#34; without going anywhere.By that I mean every episode is basically the same .1) Crazed Killers commit a crime then taunt Kevin Bacon's character2) Kevin Bacon avoids back up and goes alone to investigate3) The bad guys get the upper hand on Bacon, but don't kill him just to prove they are superior.4) Police show up and threaten to kick Bacon off case for being a lone wolf.5) Jim Carroll (main bad guy) pops up again (his superhuman invincibility makes for an annoying and borderline over the top unbelievable bad guy in this series)6) Episode ends with Bacon unable to give successful pursuit.Next episode  = go to step 1 above and repeat patternNext episode = go to step 1 and repeat pattern againetc...etc...etc....When you stop and think about the whole series, you realize the whole show was simply an endless repetitive loop of ...Good guy chases bad guy ------- Good guy corners bad guy ---- Bad Guy Escapes -------Good guy chases bad guy ------- Good guy corners bad guy ---- Bad Guy Escapes-----Good guy chases bad guy ------- Good guy corners bad guy ---- Bad Guy Escapes-----Good guy chases bad guy ------- Good guy corners bad guy ---- Bad Guy Escapes --- etc ....After awhile what should be tense and suspenseful just becomes annoying and irritating.",1391644800,2014-02-06

If it is about jet-powered engines, or awesome fighter jets, or high-powered weapons, it's like, hey boyfriend, let's watch this. Otherwise, do you need to know? Really?There was kind of a Willy Wonka one where they made candy. That was cool. LOL! But seriously? More JET FIGHTER PLANES! That's like, what you need to know about.

3.0,"If you have two hours or so you would like to kill by listening to millionaires whine about how tough it is to be them, then this is the show for you. No matter how you look at this, you are listening to people with no real connection to reality whine about how difficult it is because other people want pictures of them in order to make a paltry sum of money. An argument could be made for Fatty Arbuckle or Chaplin concerning how they did not know the paparazzi would stalk them, but not for anyone that has sought fame since the mid-60's. You're menatally challenged if you think success as a celeb does not mean being stalked by cameras and tabloids.

For people who had no clue about the series did not get any back story on the characters who participated in the movie verses the series and why.....It is like picking back up although 10 years later straight from the series....leaving out the cliff hanger from the last season though. For those who did not see the series, I'm not sure will get much from the movie other than, &#34;hey, this would be a good tv series&#34; which it would!",1396656000,2014-04-05
3.0,"I love the mentalist but the writers are spending way too much time on this red john angle. I fear that they are writting themselves off a cliff because every episode this season main focus is red john.They are not really focused on patrick jane's crime fighting skills. I can't even recall if there was another case being worked besides this red john angle. I fear that I'm going to have to start watching castle if they don't sh**t or get off the pot with this red john thing! Kill him already or kill the show! It has to be one or the other because as much as I love the mentalist, I am getting real tired of watching it! It's almost as bad as the alien angle on the x-files!

3.0,"There are many inconsistencies with this show, A homicide detective partnered with a coroner? His on again, off again girlfriend goes from being a nurse to the coroner's assistant, and his future partner; officially or not? This show appears to be more of a writing class of don't's than do's. Everything they teach you about writing and storytelling seems to have been thrown out the window with this show. I find myself doing something other than watching. If you're one of those people that likes to have the TV on for company and don't really need to watch it, this show is great for that. SPOILER ALERT; whoever is the least likely killer... did it! And like Clark Kent's glasses, only he and you can see it.",1397606400,2014-04-16

3.0,"This show has a few things going for it. Piper Perabo (playing the principle character: 'Annie' Walker) is very sexy, and the producers aren't afraid to show her in some sexy clothing and poses that make me... Christopher Gorham (playing 'Augie' Anderson) is also quite sexy (for the ladies) and once again the revealing outfits and workout scenes are abundant. The costumes, locations, sets and props are superb. It's a very stylish show, with high production value. The music (especially the title track by Flint Eastwood) is killer and the overall production value superb.  The problem with this show? The writing; specifically the portrayal of the CIA (and other intelligence agencies). The show routinely shows CIA agents conducting covert ops inside the U.S., targeting U.S. persons for ops, breaking various laws, acting in irresponsible and illegal ways. Their interaction with other intelligence agencies is always competitive, antagonistic and marked by direct competition. The ignorance (or is it disinformation?) regarding U.S. intelligence agencies (do five minutes of research on Google, why don't you?!) is disturbing, insulting, and distracting. The acting ranges from fair to downright abysmal - If Christopher Gorham is supposed to play a blind person why is he constantly dodging furniture, doorways and objects directly in his path? Is the director awake during the shoot? I don't think I'll make it beyond season two. It's fun to watch for a season or two (I saw season one as well), but ultimately this show will run out of steam.",1389139200,2014-01-08
3.0,"I really want to like this show and certainly the actors are by and large, very good in it. But the dilemma of time travel is really too hard to overcome and this series is so cavalier in its treatment of the issue as to keep me from enjoying it as much as I am predisposed to. After all, SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!! Kiera worries about changing the future but just about every more she makes, like the episode when she stopped a serial killer, could be changing that future drastically. She should have watched &#34;City on the Edge of Forever.&#34; And then there is the matter of tone. Just about all good series learn to vary it from episode to episode, to go from almost slapstick one week to somber and sad the next. The change in tone gives weight to all the episodes and makes the somber ones more somber.  But in this show, by and large, every episode is somber. If someone had a belly laugh anywhere in the two seasons, I missed it.",1376092800,2013-08-10
3.0,"I really liked this show for the first few episodes. I've continued to watch it, but it's starting to become repetative.Every episode is about the main character struggling with if he should do a cool single guy thing or give that up to help the kid. It's cute, but it's starting to get old. Sort of like Giligan's Island where you start to realize that every episode will be a new way for them to get off the island that eventually fails because Giligan screwed something up.Same thing here. Every episode is the same plot with different details. I can say that it's still funny every episode. The jokes are still entertaining and not repetative. But the basic plot of every episode is.",1399507200,2014-05-08
3.0,"Anybody who has seen &#34;Heroes&#34; will immediately know the basic outlines of this show. It's about a group of humans with superpowers who fight criminals, but with an attempt to make the superheroes more realistic rather than like comic book characters.The show is entertaining. It never really rises to greatness though. Three things held it back. First, it seems too familiar, almost like a &#34;Heroes Lite.&#34; There's nothing that really makes the show stick out, except perhaps David Strathairn, who defies the stereotypes as an elderly, kindly leader who lacks superpowers.Second, the show never seemed like it was going anywhere. Like a modern serials, which seem obsessed with continuity, the show keeps dropping hints about a bigger mystery but seldom provides resolution. Some villains disappear from the picture without use even knowing who they were or why they were such a threat. We do get some character development, especially with the female characters, but the male characters seem stuck in place. Some characters seem to just pop up once or twice but don't seem to really drive anything further.Finally, the ensemble doesn't fully work. There are a lot of things I like about the characters. They seem much more real and grounded than most TV sci-fi characters. Also, I'm glad they didn't choose a bunch of supermodels for all of the roles (the actors are attractive but not supermodels). Individually, the characters work pretty well.Unfortunately, collectively it seems like there are cliques, as if they don't all work as a team. The show seemed to have trouble finding good situations for the male and female characters to work together. Some pairings worked (like Bill and Gary), but rather than following a team I almost felt like I was watching several small groups with a loose connection to each other.Overall, I'd recommend the show for fans of dramatic sci-fi (or if you loved &#34;Heroes&#34;), but go in with realistic expectations.",1391817600,2014-02-08

4.0,This series has me hooked season-to-season. Phil &#34;the eyebrow&#34; Keoghan is terrific as the host and the producers always seem to have villain-sorts in the competition to keep dramatic tension high.I recommend the series from the first to the last. You can even find Amazing Race originating in other countries (like Australia and Philippines) if you want to see how it's done elsewhere.,1363219200,2013-03-14
4.0,"Mr. Tim Roth drives this story line although Kellie Martin is probably meant to be a co star. The think I like most is that this is a intelligent TV series because you learn about people in our society who lie, and to some extent learn about reading people with whom you deal.  I first saw Roth in a Scottish film with Liam Neeson called where he held his own which is no easy task. The rest of the cast is alright but it is Roth who carries the film with his strutting and insights.",1400976000,2014-05-25

4.0,"A nicely done, sweet romance story.  This is nothing more than a gentle reminder of what really matters in life and what doesn't.  It's not a film for deep thinkers and the portrayal of the self-help expert makes him out to be even more nauseating than the real thing (amazing, but I swear it's true).  The performances are fine and if your wife/girlfriend can accept it at face value it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes.  If you're looking for great depth, complexity or tragedy, you won't find them here.",1359849600,2013-02-03

Kit Harington as the lead is very low key in his performance and I think that is what was called for as the free boy, turned slave, turned gladiator. Very good. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the man he meets at the arena and is destined to fight to the death but become buds, he is terrific, too. Outside of out gladiator friends...not much acting to talk about. Emily Browning always looks too doe-eyed and pouting and not buying her at all as the rich girl who loves the slave. Kiefer Sutherland trying some type of accent and strutting, not a good look. some of the rest of the supporting cast isn't too bad but overall I liked it for the spectacle and some of the story.",1401840000,2014-06-04

He makes his way around, and soon enough he opens a club and becomes a 'Boss' in crime in Norway. Some of the underground crime group join him, and he soon rules a portion of Norway.

But, the mobster cannot leave this man, and he is soon into shady deals, strippers, guns and what have you in Lillehammer.Steven Van Zandt is also a member of Bruce Springsteen's band , and he still goes on tours. The one issue I have is the wig. Steven get a new look, please.  This series is funny I'm some places, lame in others. Frank, Van Zandt's character, is a half-a**** boss, tries to be tough, but somehow can't pull it off all the time. Women seem to be attracted to him, why, I don't know, power?

4.0,"These were the highlights of this one for me:1. Details of Carson's early life and the experiences that may have motivated him to host a television show. There is evidence his need for approval may have come from a mother whose approval he sought - but never quite felt he received. There is also a fascinating timeline of Carson's first television shows, not all of them successful. He was, of course, in the right place at the right time and able to take advantage of television's first days.2. Interviews with other comedians as well as those connected to the Tonight Show (Ed McMahon, Doc Severinsen). It was both interesting and touching to hear the admiration and awe from people like Dave Letterman, Jay Leno, Ellen DeGeneres, and so many others who credited Carson with paving the way for them - as well as being the benchmark for excellence.3. Clips from the Tonight show as well as other programs featuring Carson. I did wish some of the clips were longer or showed the full segment, including a hilarious one where Carson is surprised by a baby orangutan and another where Doc Severinsen discusses Thanksgiving plans with Carson. Both deserved to be seen in their entirety, instead of as excerpts. So I'm deducting a star for that.Both diehard Carson fans and those who want to know more about him should find this worth watching.",1342483200,2012-07-17

5.0,The show is a great comedy but I am very happy to see it come to a close. I think the writers should have wrapped it up in season 8. It really could have been great ending a year earlier with Ted meeting the mother much sooner. I think the long stretch irritated the viewers. The show is well worth watching to laugh but the material ended about a year ago.,1392163200,2014-02-12
5.0,Season 11 and I still like it. I didn't watch the first couple of seasons but I would like to watch it. Looking forward to Season 12.,1371168000,2013-06-14
5.0,"The last episode ended as Rick chops off Hershel's leg after he is bitten by a zombie. As they worked on him 5 living prisoners pop up and surprise the group. The prisoners thought they were a rescue team but soon realize that they are just civilians. There is a fierce standoff and the group puts Hershel onto a rolling cart and backs cautiously out of the cafeteria.The prisoners follow them and there is another confrontation and Rick and Darryl back them down. They try to negotiate a peaceful coexistence but it is difficult. The group and Rick have to decide which is worse, the violent prisoners or the flesh eating zombies....This episode is simply the best one of all of season 1, 2 and 3. The action and suspense is nonstop. If they can keep up this type of intensity then this season is destined to be spectacular. This TV show is directed, produced, acted, and written like a top class movie with a lot of action. I loved this episode and I recommend it to you.",1350259200,2012-10-15
5.0,"My husband and I really enjoyed this show.  It is a little on the graphic side but for a cop show, it is unique.  The only bad thing is we watched all of series 1 through 3 and just hate the idea to have to pay to see series 4.  We don't get the station it is currently airing on so we are left hanging until it is free.  But, the show is worth watching.",1364774400,2013-04-01
5.0,"This is the season when Dean dies because he has dealt Sam's survival in the place of his own life by trading his soul with a demon, and he got a one year delay before going to hell. The whole season is going to turn around the dilemma for Sam and for Dean. Sam will resist the idea of Dean's death and will do all he can to save him, including by dealing his own death instead, but Dean is willing to die since he-they has-have given everything to this war against the Monster, the yellow eyed demon that killed their mother, and that they supposedly killed at the end of the second season, and this war has brought them nothing as for life, enjoying life, etc. Better dying than just surviving on nothing at all, or even a dry bone. For Sam the only problem is that Dean's death means he will be alone to go on with this fight and that frightens him though we see him operating a couple of times alone and he can manage properly.We could think then the season would be rather dull. But there you are wrong and the next season is being prepared very carefully.First it is fun to fight demons. So we have a Christmas special this year, and a real Christmas special it is with reminiscences from the past when the two little boys were alone for Christmas when their father was hunting. And neither of them both forgot to get a present, no matter how little, for the other since anyway Dean did not believe in Father Christmas and Sam was told it was all a fake, a scam, a tall tale. But the Christmas party they enjoy now with two nice little Celtic survivors who decide to have some fun for this Christmas and enjoy a good old cannibalistic feast gives quite some enlightening for to the celebration. We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas, and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas, though the series being in real time, there is no reason why Christmas should not be present, especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn, some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father, looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House. One of the dummies will die in the adventure, the intern of course which does not count much, not one of the brains of the caper, and they will not be able to put the money in their bank though because Sam and Dean have manipulated their computers with a big magnet that erased all the programs, reformatted the hard disk in a jiffy.Third let's think of the poor children that are chased away from the TV and this series because of the gross nature of these horrible monsters. So let's have one full episode on fairy tales. Unluckily it is a girl in a coma who should have been unplugged from the survival equipment a long time ago by her own father, the doctor, who is reenacting in real life the fairy tales her father is telling her in her coma. The versions of Snow White and the Little Red Riding Hood are amazing and the way Sam and Dean manage to save the poor Little Red Riding Hood from the Big Bad Wolf is heroic and absolutely entertaining for very young children who will be able to learn that they must not go alone to the woods nor get in the cars of strangers.But the war against evil is serious and has little to do with a fairy tale. So let's go back to work, boys.This year is built on the presence of two women. Bela, who could be Bella of course, is a girl whose specialty is to steal ancient objects in order to sell them for a profit. She steals anything the boys, particularly Dean, may have in their pockets. A mummified hand for example, an enchanted rabbit's foot or the famous colt that can kill the Demon with one bullet. But that is too much, far too much and that will lead to the ferocious end of Dean being taken to hell by the Hounds of Hell and will end up, like in Hellraiser and Hellbound, two fairy tales told in many chapters and volumes by Saint Clive Barker, stretched out at the tip end of hooks tied up to chains that are going to dismember him forever and ever, each body part growing back after having been ripped off, I guess. A delicious ending for a monster hunter.A second woman, Ruby, who is a demon possessing a woman, is going to haunt the two boys because she wants to help and Sam is ready if not keen to listen and accept. But Dean and Sam refuse bluntly when she suggests to Sam to learn how to use his psychic power that can defeat Lilith, the demon who is after Dean's life. So he can't in the final confrontation with the girl who was possessed by Lilith and had caused a lot of damage, who has been able to get a whole gang of demons in the neighbors all around, so that the boys are trapped when they finally come into the house where the girl is living. And at the very last minute when Sam is going to kill her he is stopped by Dean who is able to feel demons since he is minutes away from Hell. Lilith in fact is in the body of Ruby who is possessed twice and since the boys do not have the special colt they can't kill the spirit Lilith in Ruby. The spirit keeps them at bay till midnight when the Hounds of Hell are introduced to get Dean away. She is so powerful she can keep Sam at bay against the wall but at the last minute the spirit Lilith goes away leaving Dean in Hell, Sam beaten up against the wall and Ruby with no good sense left in her. End of the season. Let's wait for the next one to revive the good Dean.But there is even more in this season that prepares the next season. They get rid of Gordon, the black hunter and some of his acolytes, all of them black except one. They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few. But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter. Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated, three of them black. If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice, what is it then? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their nave feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do, though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them, save humanity.At the same time another black character is redeemed, Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is possessed. He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt. But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station. The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy. And the boys exorcise the demon out of him. It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption: the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula. Brilliant. He let the two boys go, but they will learn later with Ruby on TV that the Demon Lilith, possessing a little blonde girl (evil can be everywhere and come in all forms) came herself afterward to get some vengeance and she destroyed the police station into ashes on the ground killing all those inside and close to it, including of course the redeemed FBI Special Agent. Isn't that sad? The two boys have it more and more difficult to save one person and when they do then the demon kills a dozen outsiders and innocent bystanders. But the redemption of Victor Henricksen, Special Agent by profession, is good news after all since that one was saved before being destroyed. His soul will go where it should and that is not in hell.The last remark I would like to make on this series is the great number of allusions to other classics in the field. The Shining by Stephen King is so often alluded too that I will not even specify. Come with me, Come with me, come with me, and you will know. Of course you also have Clive Barker at the end. But you have so many others like the Night of the Living Dead and in a way Michael Jackson's Thriller, If you do have some time and energy left when you have finished watching the next three seasons I would advise you to go back and identify them all. And that's where plagiarism is not what it used to be. Plagiarism used to make pale imitations of real stuff with tit bits stolen here and there, like Canada Dry instead of Whisky and ginger ale instead of real ale. We could of course think of the fake Frankenstein's monster who is the doctor himself and who has become immortal by substituting in his own body the parts that are getting old. Mad scientist, mad doctor, or whatever. There are so many of them running loose and free around in the street. Aren't you afraid of going out to smoke your cancer stick in the yard? I would be if I were you. You might be snatched by two moths from out space. Plagiarism you said? The pleasure is not plagiarized though.I will not insist on the debate between the two brothers and the love that becomes at times dense and impressive, but also at times pathetic and our empathy for the death of the elder brother is wearing out, especially since we know there are three more seasons to go and a fourth one running right now. But the car is also less present in this season. Sam has his own, by the way, and the Impala seems to have been reduced to a gadget in these episodes. It is present for sure, but certainly less than before. I hope it is not for long because I like the machine. The car seems to be less present since their future as a pair of hunters is compromised. They own the car together and it brings them together. The car being their only real possession, something they inherited from their father and that created a unity in their family, keeping them close and bringing them from one point to another together. On the trail leading to Dean's death, the car cannot keep them together or close, because one will surely die and the other is trying to save him by following new paths to save him, sometimes in ill-advised directions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE",1322697600,2011-12-01

5.0,This show was really good. Everyone did a great job on it and as you can only imagine Charlie did a great job playing the long lost (or imprisoned) son in this movie. I was curious what he would be like apart from sons of anarchy but I was definitely not disappointed. In addition I can not remember the actors name but he plays the criminal in this flick and he also did an incredible job. I would definitely say that it was well worth watching. In fact I will probably watch it again.,1353024000,2012-11-16

This is a truly great show, it has gone through several cycles - much like life, but It always leaves you wanting more.  It is writing and production beyond compare.  I am writing this after the mid-season finale and am still in disbelief that it will be another year to see them again.  You have plenty of time to binge watch it from the beginning.  In fact it is the  best way to watch it  - unfortunately one day you will be caught up, and will be left like the rest of us with only 60 minutes sessions - and always wanting more!",1401148800,2014-05-27

5.0,"The Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave in southern France contains the oldest known cave paintings -- works of remarkable beauty and detail that are all the more amazing for being more than 30,000 years old. Since access to the cave is highly restricted, Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams 3D is the next best thing to being there, and what a delightful, awe-inspiring tour it is. The 3D is used to terrific effect here -- you can practically smell the dankness of the caves, and you'll constantly feel the urge to duck stalactites -- and the paintings are gobsmackingly beautiful and haunting -- ""the birth of the modern human soul,"" as Herzog describes it. If you don't have a 3D TV, the Cave Blu-ray/3D Blu-ray combo still allows you to check out the movie, but be aware: this is one movie that really does look better in all three dimensions.",1323475200,2011-12-10

5.0,"First, an important caution when reading reviews of this product. Amazon has a policy of grouping all reviews of all formats of a film (theater, Amazon Instant  DVD, BD) together. As I submit this review there are already 23 reviews posted, only one of which is of the DVD or Bluray. So, I always suggest to look to see which product is being reviewed and to look for the date of the review. That will guide you best. Now on to my review of the Bluray.Of  the thousands of reviews I&#8217;ve written for Amazon I&#8217;ve rarely &#8211; if ever &#8211; felt that there was another review of a product that covered practically everything one could say about it. But after reading David Kusumoto&#8217;s review of the Bluray/DVD release of this film, I have to send you there for a thorough and well-written review. I&#8217;ll try to add a few more facts and my take on the film and the package.&#8220;Good Ol&#8217; Freda&#8221; started making the film festival circuit in early 2013 and played at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia in April 2013. I missed that one shot chance to catch it, but heard great things from friends and was anxious for the home video release. Magnolia films has been making a name for itself in releasing music related documentaries (&#8220;Muscle Shoals&#8221; was also at the April WXPN festival &#8211; and I did catch it and it&#8217;s great &#8211; and Magnolia will be releasing it in January (hopefully with lots of bonuses). But back to Freda.As David pointed out in his review, there is a wonderful commentary track that reveals more stories than are shone in the film. But, remember that Freda was a loyal dedicated secretary for 11 years (one year LONGER than the Beatles were together as a band) and no real secrets are revealed. But, when she discusses the parents of the &#8220;boys&#8221; &#8211; especially weekly teas with Ringo&#8217;s mom (she only refers to Ringo as &#8220;Ringo&#8221; in the Q&A; at at Beatlefest  - included as a bonus; in the film he is always called &#8220;Richie&#8221; and Brian Epstein is called &#8220;Eppie&#8221;  - you get a deeper feeling for the family life of the Fab Four.In one of the bonus interviews with the Director of the film, we learn that he shot 50 hours of film and says that he hopes that much of it would be on the DVD release. But there are only five scenes totaling just 12 minutes. (I&#8217;m not complaining &#8211; just commenting).As noted by others &#8211; four Beatles songs are included in the soundtrack, along with a bunch of classic songs that the Beatles covered (by Arthurs Alexander, The Chiffons, Marvelettes) including the most expensive to license: Ketty Lester&#8217;s &#8220;Love Letters&#8221;. Oddly enough the Lester recording was not remastered and has lots of &#8220;crackle&#8221;. Surely they could have found a better copy to use. (again, a comment, not a complaint.So, in summary, all Beatles fans will want this Bluray, even if you have seen the film at a festival. And, even if you are a casual music listener who grew up with their music, you&#8217;ll find the 87-minute film and its bonuses, worth watching.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",1386547200,2013-12-09
