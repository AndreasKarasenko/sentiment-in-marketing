1.0,"Have not used this cartridge so I am not rating this re-manufactured ink cartridge for its print quality.  My rating reflects my dissatisfaction with this vendors deceptive advertising.  This vendor is selling re-manufactured cartridges and most people wouldn't know it by looking at the items web page.  What I have learned, if the item description doesn't say OEM it isn't an Epson manufactured ink cartridge.  I think if a vendor is selling re-manufactured ink cartridges it should be in the item description!  Some will say the price should tell you it is not OEM but a lot of vendors list a low price to draw customers and then recoup there losses with an elevated shipping cost!",1284508800,2010-09-15
1.0,"I own the XP-310 Epson printer, not this model. However, there is some corporate greed technology in the XP-310 that is most likely in all of their printers.I actually really liked my Epson printer until it came time to replace the ink cartridges. I always look at the replacement cartridge prices before I buy, and the Epson were cheap. However, I soon found out that the minds at Epson went to VERY great lengths to make sure you can use only genuine, way-over priced Epson cartridges in their printer. The aftermarket cartridges won&#8217;t be &#8220;recognized&#8221; by the printer, and even the empty refillable cartridges won&#8217;t work either. Don&#8217;t bother with the bottles of ink to refill your existing Epson cartridges, for that won&#8217;t work either.I could have bought 4 black and 2 each of the other colors for $14 for the aftermarket products. Instead, the cheapest I could find for the same 10 Epson cartridges cost over $80. Actually they weren&#8217;t the same, the aftermarket were the larger capacity where the Epson cartridges at $80 were the smaller ones.Maybe other or even all other printer makers do this same thing, as I don&#8217;t buy printers often. In the mean time I will have my old Canon printer repaired and use the Epson only for scanning and copying.",1401062400,2014-05-26

1.0,"I have purchased quite a bit of bubble wrap on Amazon, and I must say this is the worst I have ever tried!  Not only did it ship in a flimsy plastic bag, which had several holes in, but the bubble wrap itself is very flimsy.

1.0,"Okay, I was trying to save some money and went for this non oem product, normally i use TN450 from Brother.First no problem with the shipping as this was fulfilled by Amazon, the only thing was I wish seller would change the price to $25 so non prime members can get the free supersaver shipping. Dont think customer will mind the extra penny.Second no compatibility issue, easy to install and my printer HL-2270DW recognize the toner right away.Third this item is suppose to be equal to TN-450 but it is not. This printed great when first installed but the print outs quickly faded. Now I kept all my print counts from the TN-450 and this product as follows:The TN 450 printed 1556 pages prior to low toner light, an additional 543 pages before the change toner light or 2099 pages.  However I got an additional 276 pages after overriding the change toner light (hit the go button 7 times) for a total of 2375 pages.This on the other hand has only printed 1041 pages before it is now too faded to continue use. Also note this doesnt give you a low toner message as TN450 toner.Overall it actually cost more to use this product as you need to change this toner more frequently than the TN 450 so go with the brother product and not this piece of crap.",1359417600,2013-01-29
1.0,"No amount of pushing or prying with a thin, sturdy object would get the tape compartment open, and I eventually decided it wasn't worth losing a finger jumst to have a two inch piece of tape pop out of the dispenser.  It isn't much smaller than a roll of tape on a plastic dispenser, with the advantage that you can strap it over your fingers, but the disadvantage that you can't size the tape as needed.  Is this really an improvement?  Perhaps it's more environmentally friendly over the long run, but only if it works.Back to the drawing board, Scotch!",1264550400,2010-01-27
1.0,"This is not a good product. The first thing I read in the user's manual was the indoor/outdoor cameras were not weatherproof. I did not see this information in any of the information on their product page.They were weather-resistant. You can not place them outside in direct rain. What good is a home security system that cannot be used inside and outside?I decided I would try to use them in protected areas so I would move forward. Then more fun happened. I paired the 3rd & 4th camera to the receiver pretty easily. Checked out the system and it looked pretty good. Then I turned the system off and moved the cameras around the house to see how it looked. When I turned the system back on it didn't work. The receiver had locked up with a black screen and the menu touch key would not work. Nothing worked it was locked up.The manual said they had 24/7 tech support. I called the Lorex tech support number and got a recorded message - they work Monday thru Friday 8 to 8 Eastern time. Unfortunately it was Friday evening just after 8pm eastern - actually 6pm where I live. Tried their e-mail same run around. Fill out a ticket and we will get back to you.NO TECH SUPPORT!I packed this up and sent it back - thank you Amazon for this service. I will continue to research home security systems, but I will stay away from Lorex. With no tech support, I don't care if they have the best product in the world - they are not customer oriented.",1386374400,2013-12-07

1.0,"OK, so sometimes the old fashioned way really isn't best. I got this because I was dissatisfied with the various electric pencil sharpeners we have, and longed for the silken-smooth action of the old-style Bostich sharpeners, complete with revolving openings for different sized pencils and handy vacuum seal that keeps it sturdily attached to your desk as you sharpen. Well after putting a dozen pencils of varying size and width through the blades of this Bostich, all I can say is Ugh. First of all, don't try to attach the vacuum base on wood. It will not stay put. Every time I fed a pencil into the sharpener opening and started to crank, the seal broke. It only worked on a formica-like surface, which did hold the seal pretty well. Second problem, noise: the thing is so loud my granddaughter came in from another room to ask what was making so much noise. I was sharpening a pencil, Honey. Wow, that's a noisy pencil sharpener! Third, clumsy cut: the sharpening blades are incredibly rough, chewing up everything from a simple basic #2 pencil to a thick charcoal drawing pencil and everything in between. The points on each pencil were anything but fine -- the charcoal fell apart, the drawing pencils never reached a point, and the paper on one type of pencil I've used for years was torn to bits. No other sharpener has ever done that. This is going in the round file.",1311811200,2011-07-28
1.0,"I was given a chance to review an Epson printer.  I never owned or used an Epson printer so I'm excited t see what all the hype is about.First off the printer looks cool but feels CHEAP!  I had to take another look to make sure this was an Epson.  So I hooked it up and started printing.  I'm NOT impressed with this printer.  Let me break down the pros and cons so we can get to the point.Pros: Print quality is decent while the cartridges last.  It is quick, but then just about everything sold is pretty quick these days.  Printer looks cool.  The printer is pretty quite.Cons: After about 10 photo prints and some coloring pages my kids printed, the ink was done!  A new set of chipped OEM cartridges costs as much as the printer. Paper feed is as clumsy, it will not let you use aftermarket ink products and goes through ink like the ink is free. Compatible cartridges are perfect physical match, rejected electronically!!Summary: The big deal with this printer is the cost of OEM ink.. If you plan to print more than 3 color PPY (pages per year) with this printer, save your money. If you plan to print fewer than 3 PPY with this printer, save your money anyway: One or two print head cleanings will deplete a $75.00 OEM cartridge set! Yikes!  Stay far, far away from this awful product.  I was really disappointed with Epson.  I'm staying with my HPs and Canon printers.",1256169600,2009-10-22

1.0,"Epson is a very greedy company. These are the exact words they say about their ink cartridges for the XP-600 printer, and presumably all of their printers:  ""All ink colors are used for printing and all-in-one maintenance, and all colours have to be installed for printing. For print quality, part of the ink from the included cartridges is used for printer startup and a variable amount of ink remains in the cartridges after the ""replace cartridge"" signal"".Really, we are all being fleeced by this company. Half of the ink is gone by the time your printer is ready to print with the standard cartridges, and the sad story is, you don't just run low on black even though you may never print anything in color because all of the colors are used, and you cannot operate the printer unless all 4 cartridges are in place. If that isn't greed, I don't know what is! I've gone through 2 black standard cartridges in a 3 month period and I never print anything in color, and always print in draft mode. You be the judge.",1382572800,2013-10-24
1.0,"This printer came in a very large box. The printer is large as the height of the unit is nearly 13.5 inches. It is also clumsy to unpack. There are very many tapes that secure the unit. They seem to be everywhere. Setting it up and connecting was not difficulty. The instruction was clear and the ink cartridges was easy to put in. Setting up the the printer to print from the phone was also easy. We also set it up with a second computer. The second computer set up was stuck at first. We had to start over the second time and then it went through fine.  Printing on regular paper for documents etc was fine. It is relatively slow. Surprising. This may be the slowest printer we have owned in a long time. The problem is this machine is for printing photographs when the expectation for quality is high. When printing there are very thin white lines that run through the page across the short side about 1.5 inches apart. The mines are all through the page. We went on-line to find solutions and we didn't find enough to fix it. Next we found Epson's website to send questions. We got an answer inside of a day. Following instruction we cleaned the nozzles and we aligned the printer. The nozzles were fine but it appears to be alignment. The output test page showed that all was aligned and fine. But the pages continued to show the white lines. Also the color of the photographs were not correct. It is too brown and red. I believe that too can be set but with the white lines through the page, we have up. It cannot print photographs were lines like that would definitely show. It won't matter as much printing a typed page as the lines are thin and you won't notice them so much.",1405814400,2014-07-20
1.0,"These really do not work at all. First, I wrote on one and stuck it to my computer monitor. Within an hour it fell off. The key thing you want from a sticky note is for it to stay stuck when you put it somewhere. These are failing on the ""stickiness"" test.Second, the colors are too dark, and when you write on them with a blue or black pen, the contrast comes out low, and what you wrote does not show up well.Overall, this product is pretty useless for me.

1.0,"I previously gave the markers four stars, but after using them for a longer amount of time, I'm giving them one star.  Like I said in my previous review, the colors are too light, and they are also pretty tiny.  If you keep your board on the refrigerator like I do, then the markers will fall off if you shut the door.  The blue one fell off one day, and the magnet broke off.  What REALLY made me mad and why I'm giving this a one-star rating is that it permanently stained my board.  I've tried using the erasers, I've tried using water and scrubbing at it with a paper towel, but the marker stains just won't come off!  I'm very upset.  Now, I have to buy a new dry erase board!",1342569600,2012-07-18
1.0,"I have finally achieved the exalted state of Yuppiedom with my sleek, streamlined iPoint (elegant) Electric pencil sharpener.When I first compared this space-aged capsule to my old pencil sharpener with a handle that tuned and that I attached to a wall, or the small multicolored plastic ones that could fit in the palm of my hand, I shivered with delight.And then I plugged it in and stuck a dull pencil in the hole.It felt tingly when I bore down as the pencil turned slowly in my hand.It was only after I examined the still dull pencil point that I realized I was supposed to hold the pencil firmly, and not let it turn.(Duh me. I'm new to such yuppie devices.)This time I held the pencil fast and let the ultra new iPoint Evolution blades rotate around the pencil, and waited for the sharpener to stop automatically when it had done its job.But it didn't.It did half a job.It did not remove the wood from one side of the pencil.I tried again.The same thing happened.I blamed the pencil for some inherent invisible defect.I tried with another.The same thing happened.I rooted around for my old 10 cent sharpener and finished the job.The old fashioned way.The way that wasn't yuppie, but the way that worked.",1327449600,2012-01-25

1.0,"Totally not impressed by this product.  In an effort to make installation easy (3M stickily foam pads instead of actually attaching to the wall) the frame is made of gray plastic instead of metal.  So the product is super light, but also super cheap looking.  Also, not helped by the fact that it was damaged during shipment and has a crease down the white board side.  The corners are angled and I'm not sure if this is on purpose or a manufacturing flaw but again, it adds to the cheap look and feel.  SKIP!!",1396742400,2014-04-06
1.0,"All cork boards aren&#8217;t created equal.  This one is definitely not a superior board; in fact, flimsy is the word that best describes it.  You can&#8217;t use it to hang jewelry on because the board can&#8217;t support the weight as the push pins are minimally supported by the thin cork. You can&#8217;t use it to secure multiple pages such as policies for the office. However, you could use it to secure single page memos and such.  The trick is to hang things that aren&#8217;t weighty.  My recommendation is to skip this one for one with better grade of cork and more substantial frame (this one is plastic). Yeah &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221; but there should be more pride in the production of a product that carries your name.

1.0,I bought the brown ink.  It is very scratchy and spotty so it is hard to see that the ink is brown -- it looks more like a very light black.

1.0,"I was genuinely surprised to learn that a printer being manufactured in 2014 does not support Mac or Airplay.  It didn't help that this failing wasn't clearly disclosed in the product description.  Perhaps Ricoh is still living in the 90's, believing that businesses only use Windows.  Whatever the reason, it is inexcusable in the very competitive market at this price point and capability.  It doesn't help that it is -also- hard to set up with difficult and frustrating menus and junk instructions.  Sure, you could jack around with it to get it running in a Mac environment or somesuch, but what's the point?

1.0,"Do not buy this garbage!  This is the worst printer I have ever come across and I have come across a lot since 1989.

Called customer support and he tells me I need a new print head (already)?!  Okay, send me one.  They send the wrong one!  I call back and tell them it might help if they sent me the right part.  Finally receive correct print head.  Works again.  On about the third cartridge replacement it does the same thing.

1.0,"Um, yeah. World's tiniest bulletin board?The bad: The dimensions listed include the frame. The frame is slightly larger than 1.5 inches wide (meaning more than 3 inches total space lost, when you include both sides or top and bottom).  The result is a usable cork area of only 7.75 x 13.75 (compared to 11 x 17 product size). Yes, that's right -- less than the width of a standard piece of paper if using in portrait orientation.The silly: the mounting screws that are included are far too large for a board of this diminutive size. Each screw is 1.5 inches long, and comes with a plastic anchor as well. Big holes in the wall, to hang a tiny bulletin board.The good: Cork is good, there's ample cardboard backing so even a longish push-pin (3/8 inch) won't go through to the wall behind, and the sticker with the Quartet logo is easily removed. Too bad they used such a large frame.Bottom line: Perfect if you need to pin up business cards (it will hold 16 cards, if you jam them right against each other), or four 3x5 photos (that's all it will hold). Otherwise, get a bigger board, or one with a smaller frame.",1401148800,2014-05-27

It snaps shut. I would prefer an adjustable closure so if the binder is not full you don't have the flap hanging slack on the side.  The clear plastic on the cover which allows you to slide in a picture or title page is made of flimsy plastic that will rip easily. There are 2 inside pockets on the left side. The rings are round.  Five plastic dividers are included.  I would have preferred D-rings and pockets on the dividers, especially for this price.

2.0,"I fully admit that I'm a pencil sharpener snob. No sharpener has been better than the one my father brought back from Japan while on a business trip when I was a kid. Unfortunately, when I asked my dad to mail me the pencil sharpener, my dad forgot to package it properly and didn't contain it with any sort of padding, and the casing arrived broken into several pieces. I was very, very sad.The biggest issue I have with many electric sharpeners is how it doesn't know when to stop sharpening. This one allegedly has a ""PencilSaver"" feature which makes the motor sound change and the pencil has a harder time being pushed into the sharpener. Well, this one doesn't work. I have very sensitive ears too, and I cannot tell the difference in the motor sound. Maybe the types of pencils are the issue, but I couldn't tell, including #2 medium hexagon-shaped pencils.Another issue is how the sharpened area isn't always centered. I think this might depend on the shape of the pencil: a hexagon-shaped pencil is decently centered, but a circular pencil is a bit off, with too much wood left on one half while the other half has not enough wood.The sharpened pencils are extremely sharp, so sharp that a kid nearly punctured a high-quality leather furniture by barely holding the sharpened pencil vertically on it - the leather has a small indentation.The feet have non-skid pads, but it still slides if you pushed the sharpener itself. However, because the pencil goes in at a 40-degree angle from the horizon, it does not slide. The dimensions at the widest/longest points (not including the adapter/power source plug) are 4 1/8"" wide by 6"" tall by 5 1/2"" deep.For the price, I would have expected a better-functioning one. But, then maybe there aren't better sharpeners out there because I haven't had any luck for several years. I'm grateful for this free one, and this sharpener may be decent enough to deserve a 3-star if I didn't have some standards for an electric pencil sharpener, but honestly, I don't like it very much. If/when it breaks, I may import one or have someone to buy one for me while traveling in Japan. I'm sorely missing my old sharpener right now.",1367366400,2013-05-01

A better design might have been along the lines of the 12"" Priority Mail USPS box formula, which is approximately the same size.It's far from sturdy, but I will use it in a modified form (I also cut the flap off, which didn't seem to be making much sense either). I'm a collage artist (messy business!) and am always eager to find a ""better mousetrap"" to keep my hundreds of file folders in order and at hand. This is definitely not a better mousetrap, but does hold up to 8 of my paper-filled folders, so will be of some use.The current price is ridiculous. It would be slightly overpriced at $4.99. I cannot imagine what the profit margin must be on this product. That is of course, if it sells. If you really think you need this Smead File Box, wait for the clearance price. It surely won't be long coming.",1349308800,2012-10-04

I tried running the 'clean printheads' several times with no luck.I blame it on a potential bad batch because when I visited our local big box retailer and purchased the same cartridge, at retail price, it worked fine.",1385596800,2013-11-28

2.0,"I tested this product by printing the same graphic sample on three different printers: one, our regular inkjet, two, a printer that accommodates much larger sheets of paper that we bought for less than $100, and three, this Samsung SL-C 1810W/XAA Wireless.The graphic was a picture of a person, in brown/black/sepia tones, with black birds taking flight in the shadowy foreground. All three printers got the basic job done with no streaking, and the colors were true, but the finer detail was lost with the Samsung. One of the birds--black against a dark background--was completely swallowed up by the shadows, while it was discernible with the other printers.The best feature of this printer is the speed: you can do a full-page graphic in less than a minute.Another advantage is that, supposedly, you can send an image from your SmartPhone to print, but we don't have phones with that capacity so we don't know how well that works.But, as with the experiment I described above, graphics are muddier than with some less expensive options, and don't come out crisply. Some detail is lost.Adjustment controls are limited, unless there is some fine-tuning I missed.Toner cartridges are between $65 and $85, that I could find. If you plan to do a lot of graphics-heavy jobs, this could get expensive.It's BIG. All-in-ones do so much more without an increase in size.For document printing, this is a good printer. If you're okay with limited or basic, average-quality graphics to enhance your projects, this may be okay, and you'll be ready to go with your finished product in a reasonable amount of time.But if you want to end up with something that looks sharp and fresh, most inkjets will work better.For us, this is a good back-up. I do a lot of printing, but rarely need graphics capability. But if I had to limit myself to one printer, this would probably not make the grade.",1402444800,2014-06-11
2.0,"Printers like this give Kodak a bad name in my opinion.  Here's why:- The color print quality is horrible.  It doesn't matter if I print from the computer or scan and copy from the unit itself, and it doesn't matter if I print on copy paper or high-quality photo paper.  No matter what, colors are washed out and dull looking.  I even tried adjusting the colors of some of the photos on the computer first, but they still look washed out when printed.- The unit is loud, looks cheap, and feels cheap.- You can't print or copy in black and white if your color cartridge is empty!  That's just insane.  Shame on you, Kodak.If I can say two nice things about this printer (they don't make up for the above problems though):- The speed is OK (not great, not horrible)- It seems to have a great wireless detection range.  It picks up network IDs in my neighborhood that none of my other devices do.As of the time of this review, I'd say this printer should be around $40-45 and no more.",1285027200,2010-09-21

Honestly, I can't say it lasting very long and inserting an 8x10 title page on the front cover it moves around a lot, with a very loose fit, making that feature fairly useless. Even less helpful are the cheap interior plastic pockets, one of which was ripped off even before I got it.This is a dirt cheap binder, and it looks and feels it.

2.0,"This is part of Smead's MO (My Organizer) system. Except for its one-piece shape, open-end and reinforced handle-holes, it's almost exactly like a fold-out gift box top and bottom that you get free in better stores at the holiday season. In other words:  This is a flimsy product. The one thing I like about it is that it stands on its own (if it is not over-loaded) and it fits in a file cabinet.  This black pattern is more stylish than the plain navy blue box in the same line.Besides its flimsiness, the ""box"" is the same height as the file folders that you put into it! Now, you tell me how you can grip the handles when they don't even extend above the folders.The idea behind the MO system is to help you organize; eliminate the clutter in your life, and to help make your life a bit simpler. I ordered this to contain end-of-year income tax paperwork that comes trickling in during January.  It's handy for that.  When my income tax is done, I'm going to borrow someone else's advice and use it to store recipes that I print out from internet sites. I have another one that I use in my vehicle to hold receipts.  In all these instances, I've been using these file boxes only as gathering places for paperwork that eventually gets filed in a more permanent location.I think I'd do better if I got out my scissors, some tape and one of those fold-out gift boxes....Actually, I think there was more value involved in the shipping of this product....",1358899200,2013-01-23
2.0,"Somehow, after years of different tax-time promotions, our house had four shredders. Over time, we accidentally gave them all away, because... well... who needs four shredders?We did need one, though. Since I've had really outstanding luck with AmazonBasics cables, so it was really a debate between the cheaperAmazonBasics cross-cut shredderor spending a little more on this one. This seemed to be the more &#34;serious&#34; of the two, so I checked out, and waited to make some confetti.Assembly was straightforward, and the instructions were only necessary to figure out where the two locking casters were supposed to go.I put in a sheet of paper, and it was dutifully reduced to confetti. Much nicer than the strip shredders I had before, and now, there's no way someone's going to be able to go through my garbage and reconstruct my shameful collection of Starbucks receipts. I was impressed.Then I started shredding things that had been piling up, and noticed very quickly that this shredder is kind of wimpy. At about four pages, it starts making some really sad noises. And when I tried some credit card junk mail, it totally choked -- leaving me to think &#34;Gee, even those free shredders were able to tell Citibank 'no thanks'.&#34; Speaking of credit cards, I happened to have one that expired last month, and gave that a shot. On one hand, the card has been totally obliterated, thanks to this shredder. On the other, it seemed like such a chore for the poor machine, I almost felt bad.The real pain, though, is the slot. If your documents aren't pristine and flat, set a little time aside to get them to go in to the very awkward slot. If you're okay with sitting down and feeding this sheet-by-sheet, you should be fine. Otherwise, this is a pain to use.Ultimately, I decided to send it back, and give the17-page AmazonBasics cross-cut shreddera try. Yes, I know it's not micro-cut, but an owner says it cuts about 1 1/4 x 1/4&#34;, which realistically, I think is enough to thwart anyone inclined to go through my garbage. With a top-loading slot and twice the rated capacity, it seemed worth the extra money.",1394668800,2014-03-13

2.0,There aren't a whole lot of things to say about a tape dispenser. This one is clearly meant for small jobs and if you are sealing a lot of boxes this one will only lead to frustration. First of all the cheap design of it means you have to hold the cylinder on the sides. This also means they can't include much tape since your hand has to fit around the entire piece. The tape was suitably sticky to seal my box but when I cut the tape with the serrated edge it would snap back onto the roll every time which means I have to go back and use my fingernails to peal it back off the roll. For a single box or even several boxes this might not be a big deal but if you planning on moving and have a lot of boxes pulling the tape back off the roll each time will get really old. I also had a problem with the tape tearing when I was pulling it back off the roll however I've never seen a tape dispenser that didn't have that problem. On the other hand if it didn't snap back onto the roll each time I wouldn't have to worry about it tearing.Scotch claims that this is refillable but God only knows how you get a new roll of tape on since it fits over a solid plastic axle and it has the look and feel of something disposable. This is clearly intended for the budget conscious customer but for my money I'd spend a little extra to get a quality tape dispenser with a handle that actually is reusable and can hold more than this tiny roll of tape.,1289174400,2010-11-08

2.0,"The Ampad Shot Note Writing Pad is a 40 sheet, one-sided, wide-ruled 5"" x 8"" notepad that you use in conjunction with a smartphone and the Ampad App to get what's on the paper onto your phone as legibly as possible.  Each pad has icons in each corner making it easy for the app to adjust the photo so that it appears to be perfectly centered, squared and bird's eye view.  Since the photo is adjusted in these ways, there is some loss of detail, but overall the result is much more legible than an unaltered photograph.  The problem is that doing all of this is a bit cumbersome unless you really need to draw something out on paper and then have it digitally accessible.  You are not going to regularly use this to store your creative writing epiphanies and such; typing them in would be much more effective.  Also if you are drawing things instead of writing words, then you don't really want lines printed on the paper and then the orientation would not have to be so exact.",1367798400,2013-05-06

It's more compact than a three-ring binder-type notebook, so if it were improved with higher quality materials and a little more functionality, I would like it.  As it is right now, I would rather just get a spiral notebook with pre-placed tabs.

2.0,"I did not use the Wireless setup and did use the enclosed CD for installation.Upon receiving, I was oohing and aahing about how sleek and pretty it looked.  Once I started unwrapping, I immediately started comparing to my HP C5280.  Yes, it looked nicer, but it's obvious functions lacked in comparison.First off, it doesn't print CD's, which is not a major concern of mine, since the Sharpie is my tool of choice when needed.Secondly, it doesn't scan negatives or slides.  This is an option I do like to have, since I do happen to have old negatives that I'd like to scan one day, somehow, someway, eventually it'll happen.  Just not with this All-In-One.Setup with the CD was easy enough, but slow.  The calibration process and printing process is slow and noisy, although no more noisy than my C5280, but definitely slower.  I'm an impatient person, when I hit that print button, I want the paper to load right away and get the ball rolling.  This doesn't happen here, nor does it with the C5280.As for the HP software, again, I'm not a fan of HP Photo Essentials, which also came with a previous printer.  I haven't given it much of a chance to give a good rating, as I hate it that much.  It's not user friendly and doesn't cooperate between printers.  I also have an HP Photosmart P1000, which yes, it is a dinosaur, but has been reliable for a good 6 years.  My printing software of choice, I believe, came with that printer, and is just called HP Photo Printing Software (v 2.2.0.4) and is a wonderful basic image editor (excellent for adjusting color/brightness issues).  You can also choose the paper size and what standard size photo is to print on that media (for example, an 8.5 x 11 page can print 4 3x5's or 3 4x6's or more 2x3's, etc).  I don't know why HP found it necessary to deviate from that software.  Another option is to install 'Windows Live Photo Gallery', which I'd rather have a root canal than install any more bloated Windows products, even though I've been a Hotmail user for years.  I also don't like the browser additions that they felt were necessary to add to my IE7 and Firefox toolbars.  I don't appreciate that kind of intrusion by ANY software manufacturer.  Yes, it's simple enough to remove them, but it would've been nice to have been asked first (which some installer programs will do).It was nice of them to include a 100 pack of 4x6 photo paper.  I'm stocked up for life as it is on photo paper as it is, so I doubt I'll ever get to use this package.  I don't print nearly as much as I had used to since there's enough online printing places that can accomodate for very reasonable prices.  I do still print a few pictures here and there though.  I printed a photo and while it did look nice, it wasn't as vivid as I'd like.  I printed another copy on an HP DJ5550 and liked the latter better, although the Photosmart Plus was more natural looking.  The quality wasn't what I expected, but I can't go into that at the moment since I'd like to print the same picture on my 2 home printers to make my final decision about the quality.All in all, I'm not overly impressed with this item.  Sure, it certainly is nice & sleek looking, but the way it performs is huge to me, and this one is lacking.EDIT: 12/2010 ---> this printer goes through A LOT of color ink.  I recently installed new HP cartridges and printed only a few 8x11 color photos and the color levels dropped significantly.  The black cartridge doesn't bleed out quite as fast.  My default setting is to print in B&W;, and only print with color when necessary.  Unfortunately when necessary, it's uses alot of color ink.The lack of a positional ""TouchSmart control panel"" is also a major inconvenience.  My previous 5280 had one, where I could flip it up and down when needed.  This one is stationary, and if you have the printer up high, you can't read the display.",1256169600,2009-10-22

I just wish a manufacturer would put a legitimite weight max like they do on ladders. The adjustment heights break down. I try to turn the adjustment knob and it ends up pitching the chair downward in one of the directions. I would have sent it back. No excuses only reasons and I won't give them here.,1352073600,2012-11-05
3.0,"Clearly there are harder problems to solve than needing two hands to tear off a piece of Scotch tape. All you have to do is tear off the pieces before you start wrapping the gift or whatever other task you need to keep one hand in, and stick them on the edge of a table. Nevertheless, there's some advantage to having bits of tape precut in a convenient pop-up dispenser.The product does not have the problems you might suspect. The small bit of tape popped-up does not stick to the dispenser. There are some clever bumps near the slot on both sides, and the tape is not supersticky. The first peice of tape does not lose its stickiness after being exposed to air for a few weeks. The pop-up pull does not fail, forcing you to take the dispenser apart and use your fingernail to pry up the next piece of tape. And the dispensers are easy to fill (the refillable rectangular ones that you wear over your fingers that is, not the round ones you stick to a desk which are non-refillable)  and use.The bright colors cannot disguise the fact that it is impossibly nerdy to wear a Scotch tape dispenser. That doesn't bother me, but if you care what others think of you, think twice before buying this.Despite the impressive design of this product, I will not be buying more. The problem is the tape is only moderately sticky, no doubt in order to prevent dispenser problems. The piece sizes are fixed so the total holding power is limited. I just don't have enough applications that need to be done one-handed for which I don't need either bigger, smaller or stickier tape. If you do, however, this product works very well.",1291075200,2010-11-30

3.0,"After buying several different pencil sharpeners and trying a few that I received from the Amazon Vine program, I am prepared to make a blanket statement regarding pencil sharpeners: they don't make them like they used to. We have bought a couple of X-ACTO brand electric sharpeners from Wal-Mart over the past few years, and they never seem to last very long. They are all made of plastic and one day just expire while in mid-sharpen. Plus, they are either making sharpeners or pencils differently than they used to, because some pencils will just never sharpen right. It's like either the point or the graphite are in the wrong place. Anyway, we got this one (a higher end sharpener) and another (slightly higher end) from Amazon Vine to compare them side by side. This one performed a little better than the el cheapo Wal-Mart one but not quite as good as the ""top-of-the-line"" one. Depending on how much you want to spend, this sharpener would probably be adequate for use in most homes, but I honestly don't have faith that it will be very long lived. (It's mostly plastic, after all.)",1370995200,2013-06-12
3.0,"I'm the packer of the family.  Not the Green Bay kind, but the ""Have Tape Gun, Will Seal"" kind. While conventional packing tape is super strong and I can seal small packages or large storage boxes quickly and economically with a gun, I was curious about this tear-by-hand product as even I have gotten some nasty cuts from the serrated cutting edge of a tape dispenser when I wan't paying attention.I received a small sample roll to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.  I compared its adhesiveness and strength to conventional packing tape.  Adhesion was comparable.  But strength is iffy depending on the package.  Because the tape tears so perfectly across its width (due to some molecular magic at 3M), if your package has any give to it, and is given a sharp punch/push where the cardboard flaps come together - for example the UPS person dropping another box on top of yours - the an across-the flap piece of tape just tears right open.  Does not happen with conventional tape.  Since this tear-by-hand tape is longitudinally strong, tape placed lengthwise along the seam should be fine.For medium duty work, I think this tape is OK (although expensive), and is great for around kids, since you don't have to worry about them getting cut on anything.",1293926400,2011-01-02
3.0,"These pencils are okay. The double flip eraser is definitely handy, in that you can simply flip it around when one eraser runs out. When both are low, you can also replace them with new erasers.

This is the second small Quartet board I tried and they both came with these really thin, flimsy magnets that barely stick to the 'fridge and are so weak they can't really even hold the product up. I had to reinforce it with other magnets I had laying around. You might as well just use the double-sided tape to stick it directly to your fridge, though I feel that somewhat defeats the purpose.The cork board is a nice touch and I like that the whiteboard itself is magnetic and it works fine as a whiteboard but the included mounting magnets don't work well enough.",1395187200,2014-03-19
3.0,"I also reviewedMead Early Learning Idea builders, Stage Three, 10 x 8 Inches, 48 Count (48306).  Please see my commentary about what efforts the author takes for introducing writing, etc...This books is different in that it works with numbers and not words and letters.  I feel that it's for Kindergarten and 1st grade but too easy/juvenile for 2nd grade.  A student of mine would have to be struggling immensely with numbers to need this type of book.The order in which the concepts are presented are rather out of order.  Teaching number words should be closer to teaching the numbers and not further along.  If you want to continuously teach this book and your child is in kindergarten you may not be able to.  It has money, time, measurement, etc.. in it which is a little above their head.  They also go into it before subtraction (and after subtraction).  There really isn't a rhyme or reason.As I wrote in my other critique this book was written by Handwriting Experts.  Mead should have consulted educational experts for content.  In my opinion if a handwriting expert wants to have a child practice handwriting in the area of numbers than avoid having them solve problems unless they fit standards and follow logical order.  I'm picky but I'm also a teacher.  Just because the person who is cited as the author is a parent doesn't mean she knows how to teach.  She is an occupational therapist and that has nothing to do with order of instruction when it comes to curriculum.",1272585600,2010-04-30

3.0,"I am the first one to praise sticky notes. I love to be able to grab a bright note to jot down something important and place it for someone else to read. The idea behind these notes is great... a sticky note that actually lays flat so it won't get caught on something else or get bent or fall off. However, the actual use of these notes is not all it's cracked up to be.First, when you try to get one off of the pad, it's hard to catch the edges of one(because they lay flat) so, if you are in a busy office like mine, the added time of trying to pull just one sheet off is not helpful.Second, when you do pull it off and stick it on something, it still may not lay flat because the motion of you trying to get that one sticky note apart from the others causes a sort of crease that will make it flip up anyway. Being careful not to crease it, takes extra time and perhaps a pair of tweezers.Third, the idea behind a lay flat sticky note for me is to stop having to put a piece of tape at the unsticky end to make it stay on the object. But these sticky notes can still fall off like the others. The glue is just the same as the normal top glue.A possible fix (although I'm unsure how this would be accomplished because they are sticky at both ends) is to have pop-up, lay flat, sticky notes.Although I love Avery products in general, I will not buy these again.",1319673600,2011-10-27

3.0,"One of the problems with reusing previous packages is normally the amount of damage it takes to remove old labels.  Or, how much trouble it is to cover an old label and not have the previous information show through the new label.  These labels are made of a brown heavy stock paper that completely blocks the old label.  But, my problem is that the dark brown material makes the printing a little more difficult to read.  So if you are concerned about a small font address, return address, or the tracking code being difficult to read - then I recommendAvery White 5-1/2 x 8-1/2-Inch Ink Jet Printer Labels, 50 per Packinstead.  It does the same job to block the information below, but on a clear white label that is easier to read, yet still blocks the label underneath.Since many of us are environmentally friendly these days, the reusing old shipping boxes could be a big part of your business model.  So, if you are looking for a brown label to complete the look of your Recycled / Earth Friendly message, then this unbleached brown color may give you the upper hand.

3.0,"Some of the things that really bug me about binders is having to reposition papers as you close it because they get hung up on the spine oriented rings. I also don't like when the rings don't line up well and the papers can get caught or slip out.Having said that, this binder addresses both those issues by having the rings affixed to the back cover of the binder so that when you close it, the papers are already laying flat against the back. And the rings are easy to open with no gaps between them.But, my binder arrived with some nick marks on the back and the crease of the back/spine hinge. It may have happened at Amazon, in shipping, unpacking at the warehouse or whatever. Also, I have bought binders for half the cost with even thicker covers and more durability. So I'm not sure why this is considered worth over $10 and listed as heavy duty.It is a nice color, has clear plastic covers on the spine, front and back to slip in your own sheet. I like the ring section for ease of use and style of closure but the rest isn't anything special. Be careful looking at the photo because it is really an illustrated graphic. All of the figure eight shapes on the hinges of the cover are graphics which is why they look so perfect. In reality, these are cut out sections of the hinge to allow for flexibility of the hinge. I'm not convinced they will hold up to a lot of wear and tear.",1383177600,2013-10-31
3.0,"The Swingline Stack-and-Shred line of shredders take a unique approach to shredding. Instead of manually feeding multiple sheets of paper into a cutter, the Stack-and-Shred uses a storage tray that you stack sheets of paper onto. The design allows you to walk away or do other things while the shredder does its thing.PROS:- Quiet operation- Innovative design- Large, 5-gallon capacity- Shreds paper clips, credit cards, and staplesCONS:- Struggles with non-letter-sized paper- Jams when wastebasket is half fullI've been securely shredding documents for years and have used several different shredders over that time. When I found out about the new way that Swingline's Stack-and-Shred shredders worked, I got excited. Well, as excited as one can get about shredders, I suppose.PERFORMANCEWith the Swingline Stack-and-Shred 80X shredder, you stack up to 80 sheets of paper in the storage tray and when you're ready to shred, just flip the power on and the Stack-and-Shred starts cutting the paper into confetti. For a guy who's been shredding documents for over 20 years, the process definitely threw me for a loop.Basically, the Stack-and-Shred has rollers, like on a printer, to drag sheets of paper down into the cutter. When the paper gets dragged down, it folds the paper in half before shredding it. This is why you can't place sheets of paper in the tray that are folded more than once. One sheet of paper folded once would equate to shredding four sheets of paper and the cutter is only rated for up to six sheets. Apparently, the cutter is built for endurance over maximum capacity. Many shredders, especially at this price range, can handle 10 or more sheets at a time, but shredding 80 sheets in a row would probably cause them to overheat. The Stack-and-Shred handled a full storage tray without any signs of overheating.After testing all different types of documents, I came to the conclusion that the Stack-and-Shred works best with standard, unwrinkled, letter-sized paper. The way that the rollers are positioned would cause problems with odd-sized paper and because it uses rollers, any wrinkled or previously folded sheets of paper would prevent the rollers from effectively grabbing them on a consistent basis.The manual 6-sheet shredding slot is suited for credit cards, thicker paper stock, legal-sized documents and other non-standard paper. One down side I found to using the manual slot was that if you keep stacked paper inside for shredding at a later time, you'd have to remove them in order to use the manual slot. Also, because the slot is located rather high above the cutters, short receipts sometimes wouldn't feed through easily.NOISE LEVELThe Stack-and-Shred is pretty quiet, for a shredder. I measured the sound output of a standard shredder and compared it with the Stack-and-Shred, confirming what my ears already told me. The ambient noise was about 18dB and went up to 60dB with a standard shredder running. The Stack-and-Shred's noise level was a muted, 48dB.MAINTENANCEThe Stack-and-Shred is maintenance-free, meaning, there's no need to oil the cutters. Swingline even recommends against using standard shredder oil.The 5-gallon, pull-out wastebasket is easy to remove, but emptying it was a bit awkward, because of its long and shallow shape. A sample shredder bag was included in the box of the Stack-and-Shred, but I'm not a big fan of using proprietary bags for disposal. The waste basket also caused the shredder to jam when it was only half full.Once I figured out what types of paper to use in the paper tray, the Stack-and-Shred rarely jammed, except when the wastebasket got partially full. The problem, I noticed, was that the shredded confetti didn't fill up evenly in the wastebasket. Therefore, when the confetti built up in the rear of the wastebasket, freshly shredded paper had no place to go and caused the cutter to jam. Though this was easily remedied by pulling the wastebasket out and giving it a good shake to spread the confetti around, it caused a big mess. My suggestion to Swingline would be to integrate a manual rake-like mechanism that spreads the confetti around evenly. That way, a user could even out the wastebasket periodically, preventing this type of jam and avoiding a mess.CONCLUSIONI love that Swingline created a new and innovative way to shred documents. It's quiet and can be a real time-saver. However, Swingline needs to find a way to better handle non-letter-sized paper. If you tend to shred a lot of odd-sized paper, the Stack-and-Shred may not be your best bet. If you stick to letter-sized paper though, the Swingline Stack-and-Shred 80X can provide a nice, care-free way to shred documents.* Review unit provided by Swingline",1329696000,2012-02-20
3.0,"I found this to be a nifty stapler for home use. I actually already have one of these and then got one through Vine, sort of as a backup since for some reason, we tend to wear out our staplers at home! The stapler is supposed to staple up to 15 sheets at a time, but I think 10 pages is more like it, though I guess it would depend on the thickness of the paper.It works quite differently than a regular stapler and the staples are loaded in a different manner too, though this is not much of a problem, and users just need to get used to it. The staples holder doesn't load a full set of regular staples. I do think it is a bit pricey though for its performance.",1356739200,2012-12-29

3.0,"I like this printer as I've liked all Epson printers. I have always found them very easy to set up with my PC and (now) devices (hold that thought). They always make quality prints. The cost of operation is manageable.This is a very large machine as compared to others. I'm a bit of a weakling, true, so I needed help putting the printer into position. I was able to easily set up the wireless connection. I can't speak to the FAX abilities since that feature isn't connected at this time, but the dialogue box on the printer's panel is straight forward and intuitive.Here's the holdup: I am now 65% into a driver download from Epson that still has half an hour to go over a high speed internet connection onto a zippy PC, so that I can have the proper dialogue box appear when I go to print. Without that driver, the dialogue is very basic: letter size paper, plain or glossy; 4x6 plain or glossy. That's pretty much it. All of my other Epsons featured the option of choosing plain paper in a variety of sizes up to choosing art quality photo paper in a variety of sizes and to print draft up through best, with several quality steps in between, no matter if I was using word processing or graphics design software.If I was on a slower speed internet connection, this would be intolerable. I don't understand that part. I'm sure it will all shake out in the end. I'll report back one way or another.Also worth noting, I've come to expect Epson printers to include a CD-DVD printing capability. This machine, for all its heft, bells and whistles, does not include that feature. They don't claim to, either, but some people might ""assume"", so I thought it worth mentioning.The color 4x6 prints I made were striking. The color output on plain paper has been perfect. The machine prints quickly and quietly. And I am delighted to now have the ability to make 13x19 prints! It's a go.UPDATE: Well this is unfortunate. I was able (in two tries) to get the drivers and firmware updated, so I now have a good-and-proper dialogue box in all of the programs that I use for printing (I have Windows 8.1, also up to date, by the way). Perfect. Except.Although I was able to print before the updates from any program, Adobe Photoshop (latest version) now crashes whenever I select print. It worked before the updates, now it doesn't. I'm sure this will shake out soon, or maybe I'll have to spend hours screwing around with it and everything will eventually work out. But in the meantime, Photoshop isn't exactly an obscure program and this shouldn't be a problem. But it is. (sigh) The good news is, files print beautifully from Adobe Lightroom, so there's that, then.ANOTHER UPDATE (FINAL, June 30th): ...and so to correct this problem, I simply uninstalled the WF-7610 from my computer and then reinstalled it. Why it didn't work out of the box, I don't know, but it works now in all of my software with the proper options and dialogue box. All that aside, it does make beautiful prints.",1403827200,2014-06-27
3.0,"I am a huge lover of sticky notes.  I have them stuck all over my desk and I just don't know how I'd remember anything without them...  There's really not much to say about sticky notes: they're square, you write on them, and then stick them somewhere.  That being said, there is one requirement I absolutely have for a good sticky note - it needs to actually be sticky.  Herein lies the problem with these Post-It brand ""Greener Notes"" - I've noticed that they just aren't as sticky as my regular sticky notes, nor many other sticky notes I've come across.  I don't know why, but when I compared one of these sticky notes to one of my regulars, the stick-factor was much less.  Since I like to stick these to my desk, it's very annoying when my sticky notes get accidentally brushed off (or blown off by a gust of air from the air conditioning vent) because they just don't have enough stick.  I will say, though, that these are not the least-sticky post-it notes I've ever dealt with, and they would probably work fine in a situation where they aren't as close to your work area (where you might be accidentally be brushing against them).  Other than that, the only other thing I can think of to comment on is the color - the package says these are ""pastel"", and they really are!  Don't expect these to jump out at you with bright colors!  The color of these is actually quite soft and muted, but of course, that's what one would expect from ""pastels"".  I honestly don't care about the colors much either way, but I thought I'd mention it as some people prefer brighter attention-grabbing colors.  Well, other than the stickiness problem, these are okay sticky notes; I give these sticky notes 3 stars for being decent but not perfect.",1301443200,2011-03-30
3.0,"Compared to regular Post-it notes, the entire backing of these labels is adhesive.  To remove them from the pad, there is then a non-sticky, tear-off portion.  The tear-off portion doesn't tear-off that easily and leaves a somewhat torn edge which is not as clean as with regular pads.  You almost have to pinch it and tear it to get it started.The whole point of these labels with full adhesive coverage is then to stick to things like storage containers, etc.  These containers sometimes have weird slippery plastic film on them or are not that smooth, so regular Post-it notes do not stick so well.  These are better, but I would not go so far as to call them super sticky.  They are adequate, especially on clean surfaces, but not ""Super"".  Super would borderline on being difficult to remove (which would be a good thing).  They are definitely removable which means they could still come off during normal handling, but yes, they are more sticky than regular Post-it notes.Finally, these are rather pricey for such a tiny package.See my customer image for the tear strip part.",1261612800,2009-12-24
3.0,"**Spoiler Alert: Original review was written in 2010, read the 'updates' to learn the journey I took with this product.**Received as part of the Amazon Vine reviewer program, the HP Officejet Pro 8500A is a wireless, all-in-one (printer, fax, scanner, copier, web) office tool.  It uses the current touchscreen technology to offer the user a way to fax, scan, copy and print without the use of a computer directly attached to it.SET-UP:Once I unboxed this beast (it's quite a bit heavier and larger than my previous printer:HP Officejet 6310 All-in-One Printer), it took a few minutes to check the box contents and untape parts that were immobilized as part of packaging.A very basic (10) step sheet with pictures and minimal directions directs you how to install the two print heads, four ink cartridges, the HP automatic two-sided printing accessory (duplexer) and load the paper.  It also shows you for PC or Mac computers how to hook up the printer via a usb cord, ethernet (internet cord) or via a wireless home network (found in the Getting Started Guide).Once you power up the printer it takes approximately 20 minutes to go through a series of checks prior to asking you if you want to 'update'.  As I'd already established a wireless connection with the printer by following the prompts on the touchscreen and entering my home network's security code, I had it do an update which took about 5 minutes.  All in all, the 25-30 minutes the all-in-one spent getting ready for use was no big deal.  It took me about 45 minutes to get it set-up prior to that time, and I'm fairly savy about such things. The directions that come with it rely heavily on drawings and had to be referred to frequently - at least for me.So a little over an hour into set-up I installed the software on my primary computer. This took about 10 minutes.  Later I also went to the HP site and got the very basic drivers (a 64MB download) for the printer to install on 2 laptops (Vista 64-bit and Windows 7), 1 netbook (Windows XP) and 2 desktops (Vista 64-bit and Windows XP).  All the computers installed the drivers quickly and easily, and once installed printed wirelessly off the 8500A.  I was amazed with that one... no hic-ups with drivers?!I also went to iTunes and got a free app: HP iPrint Photo.  Once loaded on your iTouch or iPhone you can use it to send photos or documents to print to this printer, or any HP printer (I'm assuming other non-HP printers won't work with this app) connected to your network.  It worked with both the 8500A and the 6300 (hardwired to my router).Between the unboxing, untaping, installing of ink and printer heads, the all-in-one's auto set-up and software installation, getting this one up and running took about 1.5 hours.  That's much longer than most printers I've wrestled with in the past, but I did take my time and gently worked each step.The only device I did not get linked to the 8500A was my phone:Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White).  I tried multiple times to get it to recognize the printer, but thus far, nothing.  I'll continue to work on it.FEATURES per the box:+Printing speeds equivalent to laser printers (35ppm black and 34ppm color - max).+Water resistant-inks.+Wireless networking.+35 page automatic document feeder (ADF)+Automatic two-sided printing; saving time and paper+4800 x 4800 dpi, 48-bit color scanning+App printing via touchscreen - print directly from the web without a computer+Printing from anywhere via mobile devices using HP ePrint (the printer has its own email addresss)+Front panel usb port and memory card slots for digital cameras+Fax to network folder, to PC and PC Fax Send.++ Eco-friendly solution, offering 50% lower cost per page than other similar all-in-one printers.""What does all this mean?""  Ideally, if you buy this one you'll get a wireless printer, scanner, copier, fax machine, that may cost you a bit less to print the same number of pages with another printer and gives you laser printer quality and speed.  At least in theory, but time will tell if that pans out.What I liked about it...+The machine is good-looking.  Sleek, glossy black with a color touch screen.+The touch screen itself is small, but responsive and quick.+It can be placed anywhere in your home or office as long as your wireless network connection is adequate.+The flatbed scanner allows for legal sized documents.+You can scan your ID - getting both sides at the same time on one page - very cool!+The print quality is excellent.+The print speed is fast.+Connectivity with my iTouch via HP's app.+Scanning is very quick and the quality is excellent.+Printer drivers installed quickly and easily via HP.com download on all my computers running Vista 64-bit, XP Home and Windows 7 - without a hitch!+You can copy or print without a PC attached and 'on', via the touch screen.+Touchscreen animation will show you how to clear a paper jam, step-by-step.  Had one...watched the little show and fixed it.What I disliked about it...- The machine took a long time to set-up for initial use, and it goes through a lot of checks (for about 30-60 seconds) before it can be used if powered off and turned back on.- Makes a lot of noise while it's printing!  Thankfully...it prints quickly, and it isn't as noisy while scanning, copying or faxing.-The size is a bit bigger than I'd hoped for and it weighs about 25 pounds, but it does a lot and 'compact' was not one of its selling points.- The printing of photos is nice, but leaves regular paper soggy.  You need to useHP Premium Presentation PaperorHP Premium Photo Paper, glossy (100 sheets, 4 x 6-inch borderless)to get the right look and feel.- Time will tell if ink costs are less or not, but to replace all the cartridges at one time will be a bit expensive.HP 940xl Black, Regular Capacity Cyan, Magenta, YellowNot overly expensive when compared with other HP ink cartridges, so I wonder where the claim '50% lower cost per page' comes from?-HP included software has some unnecessary stuff on it that loads on your computer if you're not aware enough of what to 'uncheck' to stop it before you install the software.  HP is notorious for this type of thing and can be very irksome.-The HP Apps installed on the machine are minimal at this time.  You can print off daily news stories from Yahoo, weather reports, puzzles, recipes, etc..., but for me, at least right now, the apps are more fluff than substance.  You have to go online to do your settings and establish an 'email address' for your printer, instead of using the touchscreen to do all of it.  Sort of defeating the purpose of the screen and wireless capabilities - at least for setup.-HP Apps failed to work every time.  When I tried to get a daily summary for Yahoo, it couldn't retrieve the info. I went to the HP ePrintCenter online, and it said my printer was offline.  I refreshed it and it still didn't work.  I then turned off my printer and turned it back on.  It was then recognized online and printed via the app within 5 seconds.  This was after I had setup my account and HP said all was well.  **A few bugs need to be worked out, but this is probably a network/software glitch and may be just with the Yahoo app.My CONCLUSION:It's a good e-All-in-One with cool web and file transfer possibilities, but a noisy printer. The cost is a bit high for a wireless all-in-one, but the web features and eco-friendly printing may be worth the price boost.I'm excited to have a wireless printer that installed so easily on my home network and can be placed anywhere in my home. I love the scanner, and look forward to scanning old photos more quickly than my old scanner.I also like the ability to send photos from my iTouch or iPhone to the printer wirelessly. The touchscreen was a great addition and it works well. It's a stand-alone device in many ways, and doesn't need to be tethered to a computer to copy or fax, which I like too.Overall, the Officejet Pro 8500A Wireless e-All-in-One seems to be a solidly built office tool that will appeal to home office users and families who want its many functions and a lower cost per page.NOTE RE: Nokia E71 phones, printing wirelessly...After much research and little assistance I lucked out and figured out the right configuration for printing from the Nokia phone.  In your 'printers' on your phone, set up a new printer using these settings.Printer: any name...Driver: HP Mobile PrintingBearer: LPRAccess point:  make sure this is whatever network name your wireless printer is currently using.Host:  this is to be set to your printer's IP address.User: also known as 'hostname'.Queue: I put in the name of my network (SSID).Printer model: 'officejet' printersI can't print using the Ovi store's HP iPrint Photo app, but the above stated worked for me on about a 3 second delay to the printer.  This fix may also work for other Nokia smartphones and HP printers.UPDATE: July 25, 2011This is still my 'go to' printer and the one networked to all the other computers and wireless devices on my home network (10 in all).  Ink costs have been very low as it does seem to sip versus suck down ink.  Print quality has not suffered because of it and I've been very happy with print quality on regular paper as well as photo paper.After updating one computer from Vista to Windows 7 I did run into an occasional problem.  The printer would forget that it was on the network and I would have to do the 'search for new printer' thing to get it recognized.  Recent Win 7 updates seem to have fixed this problem.Another issue has been with the 'scan to computer' feature.  It won't do it via the network, instead I have to put in a media device and transfer the file to that before taking it over to the computer.  A pain, and probably something to do with security settings on the network that I've just not figured out yet.  I did upgrade my wireless router and that may be an issue with those two not getting along.Overall I'm still very pleased with this printer.  I see it as a great choice for busy families, a home office or a college dorm room.UPDATE: August 28, 2011Printer problems continued regarding the driver, until a recent update.  The printer asked if I wanted to install the update, and when I OK'd it, it installed it and things have been smooth sailing ever since regarding commands from the PC and the touchpad.A reoccurring issue is that occasionally the mechanism that grabs the paper to print doesn't engage and when I attempt to assist it, a jam occurs.  This is frustrating, but not a deal breaker. I find that less paper in the holder helps to make this an infrequent event.Another reoccurring issue is that when I go to scan from the touchpad and send the scan to a USB drive I've placed into the port on the memory card reader, I get 'memory card error'.  Doesn't seem to matter if it's a freshly formatted drive or not, and the only thing that seems to clear the error is to restart the machine with the USB drive plugged in versus plugging it in after it's already 'on'.Ink longevity with this one is tremendous!  Perhaps one of its greatest strengths.  The ink costs are high by comparison to some printers, but they seem to last forever so I think it all works out in the end.UPDATE: 12/2712Printer is still kicking along nicely, however issues with dropped wifi connectivity have plagued me with this one.  I tried assigning it a static IP address, and it would still lose the connection.  Oh it says 'connected' and 'ready', but won't print.  A reinstallation of the drivers for this series works temporarily, but not for long.Today I noted that drivers for this model were not showing up in my Windows 7 driver updates.  I chose the closest to it I could find for the HP Officeject Pro K850, and so far, it's working.  I don't know what's up, but I'm holding my breath and crossing my fingers.UPDATE: 7/13/13This printer has be re-located at my parents home and they are quite happy with it, but frankly they don't use it wirelessly and print infrequently. They use it very little other than to print an occasional letter or copy something.I ended up going with aEpson WorkForce 545 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax, iOS/Tablet/Smartphone/AirPrint Compatible (C11CB88201)for its AirPrint capabilities, smaller footprint and lower inkjet costs.Be aware that this printer is now considered 'old' by electronics standards - over 2 years old, and that there are better ones out there.  I've dropped my review to a 3 out of 5 star rating (It's OK) because of four things.1. Driver issues that were never 100% addressed by HP updates.2. Ink prices for this unit are high.3. Intermittent connectivity issues with a dropped IP address, even when assigned.4. AirPrint capabilities were never consistently available, even using multiple related apps.**My two cents... there's really no reason to pay over three hundred for the features included in this or any inkjet printer and there are many with these features for less available right now.**UPDATE: 10/19/13 - Parents continue to enjoy this printer which is now wired to a Windows 8 PC.  Getting it to connect wirelessly seemed to be impossible, despite the latest drivers being loaded onto the Win 8 laptop.  Ink costs for this printer are high, which was a shocker to the folks! I'm sure that when this printer stops working, we'll be looking at a more economical, smaller footprint one.  Despite this, the longevity of this product would have me purchasing HP in the future if the price and specs were right.",1288310400,2010-10-29
3.0,"I am a pen geek - a title I wear proudly. From my first Parker T-ball Jotter in high school to my most recent Faber Castell purchase, I like and try to always use quality pens. Pilot has a wonderful reputation so I was expecting this pen to rock my world. Some other reviewers have accurately identified the basic flaws - big, weirdly designed clip, slippery grip, being the two that I feel are unfortunate in what could have been a great pen.Happily, the pen writes very well - fine point, dark ink and it seems to write in any direction. But when I opened the pen up to examine the refill, I was surprised to see a thin, ordinary-looking refill with a ""plug"" at the top that I assume is part of how they pressurize the ink. Looking carefully, I noticed that they don't use a spring at the point end to make the refill retract. They lock the refill in the cap end. This is how the clicking mechanism (I assume) pumps air into the refill. This feature also helps ensure that you can't use a regular refill in the pen. That also means you can't use these refills in other pens. Smart marketing or good engineering? I'll let you decide.I don't like this pen very much. The barrel is too thick and the hard plastic knurled grip isn't very comfortable. The clip looks like a loser in the Werner Von Braun Junior High science fair.I give it 1 star because the refill writes well. I add 1 star for the writes-at-an-angle pressurized design and 1 star for the satisfying, pressurizing ""click"" (although I admit, that's a stretch).My suggestion: Try it before you buy it - Pilot makes much better pens at much better prices. Plus, if you need the benefits of a pressurized refill, look at Fisher Space Pens - you may find them more to your liking although I have had these refills spring a leak and make a mess in the pen case.Not recommended.",1364169600,2013-03-25
3.0,"I had a Boston Sharpener that looked just like this one.  I had had it for 20 years and it worked really well.  Finally it gave out and I got this one which looked to be pretty much the same thing... I think Xacto even bought out Boston.It isn't the same but like everything now a days quality is in decline.  I think I'd have had to pay $50 or $100 for the same quality unit as I had had before... and I just didn't have that kind of money to spend on a pencil sharpener that I may or may not like if you know what I mean.The motor just does not feel as powerful.  It takes longer to sharpen a pencil.  It says it has an auto shut off and it does but it is not as easy to tell with this model as it was with my other one... it's a very subtle sound and feel on this one.  This one gets hot faster than my other one so I can only sharpen 7 pencils before I feel that I need to stop and let it ""rest"" before it overheats and stops running.I also note that the pencils don't seem to get sharpened all the way on one side, you have to twist them half way through a sharpen to make sure all sides get sharpened to a point if that makes sense.So while I am disappointed with the quality I think this is the best you are going to do for the price.  If you want better quality you will probably have to pay extra for it.",1343952000,2012-08-03
3.0,"It's a white board. It's not thick, not thin. Okay quality. The catch is that the included pen acts more permanent than erasable. You have to use a wet cloth to erase the ink. If you leave the ink on the board for some time, it will take some elbow grease. I purchased some additional Bic dry erase pens and they work great with this board. If you do that, you'll be satisfied.",1324944000,2011-12-27
3.0,"For those who own HP printers that use 901 cartridges this is the the black cartridge that I recommend to people.  While it suffers from the same terrible HP rating system it does perform far superior to that of the 901 standard black and will save you $ in the end if you print a lot of black.This cartridge is rated for 700 pages before running out, but that rating is very misleading.  From my research, HP rates their cartridge off the ISO standard high-yield page, not off every day use or pictures.  They also use a J4580 printer which is an INK SAVER printer.  Because of this the cartridges used in printers other than a J4580 can get random results.  I owned 2 black standard 901's and both gave completely different results probably due to the amount of black ink on the pages I was printing.Example: Cartridge B prints nothing but black Bars... Cartridge A prints nothing but text documents.  B only can do 110 pages while A does almost 215.The same example holds true to the XL cartridge. Depending on how dense the black is on the page and your Print Quality you might never even see 400 pages with an XL cartridge.  I tend to print on FAST/economy for almost everything except if it is an important document.  Doing so the 901XL has lasted me well over 500 pages (one ream of paper) and still shows as 50% full.  Still despite my success with the 901XL I could of easily printed 300 pages of bar graphs(Black and White) on FAST/Economy and been out of ink already.With that said I have to give this cartridge 3 stars.  It gives you far more bang for you $ when you compare it to the standard 901 black, as ONE 901XL has lasted me twice as long as two 901 standards did combined.  However do not trust the 700 page rating as it only will hold true under certain circumstances.  Print smart and use Fast/Economy whenever you can to help preserve the life of your ink.",1308009600,2011-06-14
3.0,"These tabs are very nice and heavy weight.  They are easy to write on.  The ink glides on very smooth.  The pink is very bright, and surprisingly the blue is a little more muted or flat.  Both colors are very nice.The downside for me is that they are SO thick.  You could have twice as many in a pack if they weren't so thick.After using these tabs for a while, they have really grown on me.  They are especially useful for school books.  I took an MBA course recently, and they helped me keep things organized.  I've used the tabs as permanent dividers, although they could be used in other ways.

3.0,"These are fun to use because they are so bright, but the little ""erasers"" at the top certainly aren't practical.  They bend with even the littlest pressure and make erasing a long and annoying task.  Just use a regular eraser.  Also, if you don't erase right away (sometimes we leave things on the board for a week or so), you need to get some windex to get the color off.  Also, the ""mini"" size is a little hard to write with at times.  The colors are fun though and it might be nice for little hands in a long car ride (no big odor).",1342310400,2012-07-15
3.0,"So much to like . . . and so much they just didn't get right.I was fortunate enough to be asked to take this home and kick the tires. This has potential, but it feels like a &#34;beta version.&#34; Okay, starting out with the material. The material is sturdy nylon-like plastic, and has no inserts to keep it stiff. This is a plus, but you should know this going in. The product images don't make this obvious, and it is not in the description. It is flexible like a paperback book. This means that any pens and pencils you put in it (things that are not flexible) are not protected very well, as they will jut out--especially if they are in the outside front pocket.The quality of construction (Velcro, zippers, attachments) is sub-standard. What happened? A little more care would have made this a &#34;must have.&#34;Here are the points I think you should know, since you can't &#34;pick it up and feel it&#34; on Amazon.* No rigidity (this can be good or bad)* Cheap zippers (don't expect them to last long)* I do like that the whole thing zips closed. It seems relatively waterproof* Outside pocket is practically worthless except for small scraps of paper/pencils/pens . . .* Three ring binder is detachable (why?) Sorry--I just don't get it* Three ring assembly attached to Velcro--but so badly made you will feel cheated* &#34;Has internal pockets&#34;--that's it! Nothing else--not even a pad of paperThis is a cheaply made version of &#34;nothing spectacular.&#34; There is no wow factor. There is nothing new, except maybe the fact that you can take your 3-ring assembly out (and do what with it?). Now you have a waterproof book container? It will fit one standard textbook, and not much else. I was really excited to get this. As an author I had all kinds of ideas for it (writing on the beach, having a small portable case for papers . . .). It just doesn't live up to the price or the hype. Note how their are no interior shots (from the manufacturer). CAVEAT EMPTOR!Five Star is the top manufacturer (IMHO) of binders. They make VERY good stuff--normally. This time I think they rushed the idea through &#34;product development&#34; and to the cheapest manufacturer they could find. I might pay $6 for this, but not $16. Anyway, thanks for reading.

3.0,"I will confirm what other reviewers have said, this does not reliably staples 20 sheets. I believe that estimate was achieved using very thin stock. As far as its effectiveness, it's on par with a mini-stapler.But that's all I need at the office. We've moved away from paper documents. We're all about PDFs.

4.0,"I tried these labels on many different surfaces. They worked very well on paper, wood (laminate) and cardboard. The labels removed very easily from these materials and did not leave any residue. However, when I tried these labels on plastic folders I encountered some problems. Sometimes the label would curl up on the edges. Other times the label just wouldn't stick at all to the plastic. When they did stick to the plastic, they did remove easily and again with no sticky residue, but it was frustrating to have to use 3 or 4 labels to get one to stick correctly to the plastic folders.The plus side to these labels is that they have the tab on the end so that you can easily grab one and remove it from the rest. That tab will also cleanly tear off so that after the label is stuck down it looks nice. The sticky totally covers the back of the label, instead of there just being a skinny strip of sticky down the middle. I like the solid color of the labels as they look nice and clean. These labels are made from 80% post consumer paper so that is always a big plus to be able to help the environment.The negative of the labels is that they didn't always stick down properly. Don't write on them until you have them stuck down to what you want them on. If you write on them and then immediately stick them on something and run your finger along the face of the label, the ink will smear.Overall, the labels do what they say but if you are looking to mainly use them on plastic folders you may want to look for another label.

4.0,"I recently bought this phone after several two more expensive models failed; his telephone by AT&T; and Lucent works better than the other phones I bought when I had to get a new phone for my home. The construction of this telephone reflects great engineering; and it's very, very reliable for a price that's very inexpensive these days for a phone. Yes, it is corded; but when all you really need is a basic phone this really does the job. Besides, the fact that this is corded means you'll never misplace the cordless handset!The phone has back lit buttons which are desirable for those of us who are elderly or in any way sight impaired. The buttons could be brighter but the back lighting does improve upon no lighting. The phone offers well known features including ""last number redial,"" too. The phone has a mute feature, adjustable ringer volume and more. These functions never disappoint me. It also has a small knob that lets you switch between touch tone and pulse (rotary) dialing. I use touch tone dialing as most people do. I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing. Cool! However, as another reviewer correctly notes, when you program the phone to remember frequently dialed numbers, you need to actually dial the number--so hang up fast if you don't intend to speak with that person at just that moment! I don't care for that so I will take off one star for this.If you want to take a nap without the phone ringing, just turn the ringer off by using the knob at the base of the phone. That's an incredibly useful feature!I highly recommend this telephone for people who merely want a basic, inexpensive phone that still has a few ""frills"" to like including memory speed dialing and mute. The extra features give you all you truly need to make this a well constructed telephone at a rather inexpensive price. Sure, the back lighting for the buttons on the phone could be brighter; but overall this is still quite a good phone for the price.

4.0,"If you already know how to use a comb binder, the Fellowes is perfect for small jobs.  However, the instructions included in the box are very unclear.  I think Fellowes expects people who buy this item to be experienced with comb binding.  I was not.  I was able to find a very shirt clip of the binder in action on the Fellowes Website (as of 12/29/2010).  This was helpful in figuring out how to use the binder.The body of the Pulsar is made of plastic, while the comb mechanism and arms are metal.  Punching 15 sheets at once required some exertion, but the Pulsar seemed to hold up to the force.  The rectangular punches looked fairly smooth.Attaching the comb was the difficult part since the instructions were greatly lacking.  After the comb is pulled apart, the user simply places the pages onto the comb and then slowly pushes back the smaller handle.  This maneuver requires some precision and patience on the part of the user.  If you're too fast, the comb sometimes detaches from the pages, requiring the user to re-do the comb process.Overall, this is a nice comb binding machine.  It's purely mechanical, with no electronic parts.  It would work well for a small office or school.  It feels sturdy, but since it has a plastic body, it's probably not the best option for people who need to use a comb binder on a daily basis.",1293580800,2010-12-29

An unsuspecting person may try to open the envelope normally, but even if you did it very gently the micro perforations would tear before you got an inch open. So armed with the knowledge the security feature was there I tried my best to incredibly slowly open the envelope. After a few minutes lightly plucking at it I did get it open without too much visible tearing, but even my very slow efforts did indicate tampering so again top marks. One thing I did note was at no point did I see the warning text claimed on the product box. I assume I'd have to steam open the envelope to see them I guess so I was surprised and disappointed by that.However, for a relatively inexpensive product these did what they were supposed to.

4.0,"For several years, I have been using PaperPro brand staplers at home and at work for ease of stapling, so I was anxious to try out a competitor as I do a lot of stapling.  Like many others who have reviewed this Swingline SmartTouch Stapler here, I had some difficulty figuring out how to load staples into the stapler, but I must say, doing so was ultimately easier to figure out and accomplish than with the PaperPro products.  So, while it would be helpful if Swingline had better instructions for loading staples, I did figure it out in about five minutes.  With regard to performance, the Swingline SmartTouch works beautifully.  It is ergonomically designed, fits my hand very well, and staples with very little pressure.  It is solidly made of metal, and continued to work just fine after I dropped it hard on a wood floor (Many lesser staplers have not survived such plunges - I'm just clumsy - it wasn't the stapler's fault, I knocked it off a table by mistake).  Most important to me is price, and Amazon is offering this good stapler at a great price.  No smart touch or easy touch PaperPro product can be purchased for anywhere near this price.  So, if you want a solid stapler that is easy to use and is a great value, financially, this is for you.",1382313600,2013-10-21
4.0,"I purchased this printer to replace an inkjet printer that wasn't working for my application. First of all I was amazed that the product arrived intact and without damage. This guy is heavy! And it shipped in it's retail packaging. (save the box just in case you ever have to ship it back)I originally hooked this up to my PC based network and the drivers were out of date and it took the usual fooling around, downloading drivers etc. to get it working. A couple days later we scrapped our PC network and switched over to iMac's. We plugged the Ethernet cable to the router, and viola it was hooked up and working. The Mac OS already had the drivers as part of the operating system and automatically looked for any updates. Inside of three minutes the printer was hooked up, installed and ready for service.The print quality is more than adequate for business use. We occasionally print out photos and the quality is outstanding. The printer does take a while to warm up but the print and processing speed is plenty fast enough for our needs.Be careful with toner. There is a lot of info out there on the toner life. Rather than rehash, when the printer says you need a new cartridge, you don't. Simply reset the timing gears and your off for another couple hundred or more pages.All in all, I feel this printer was a great value. We must have caught some sort of sale or promotion at four hundred sixty five dollars with free shipping. At that price for such a full featured multi function printer it was a no brainer. Even at the ""regular"" price of seven hundred it still represents a good value compared to what else is out there.",1266796800,2010-02-22

I figured address labels would be a good size, and when I saw the clear ones, I thought they look better than the solid white ones.I thought wrong. These did not work for my purpose AT ALL. The clear showed air pockets on the bubble containers, and (even after letting the labels dry overnight) when I tried to smooth them out, there was some smudging. Even the slightest bit of moisture smears the labels, which isn't really a good idea for something that is going to hold bubbles.

4.0,"We started using this with our 5 and almost 4 year old. They both seemed to enjoy the activities, but the almost 4 year old seemed to get more out of it.  Our 5 year old missed the deadline for Kindergarten, so he is in a Trans-K program, and he seemed a bit bored at times with some of the activities.  Our younger son seemed to enjoy the activities a lot, and has definitely made some strides with number recognition and writing.  I think this is a good stepping stone for kids going into kindergarten, particularly without a pre-school program behind them.  Our younger son has never done any structured learning like this, but he was very willing to sit down and follow the instructions, etc.  It was good practice and he really does seem to be retaining a lot of what is worked on in the book.  He can use his fingers to count where before, he would get easily confused and have to start over again.  He can also recognize any number on a sign, but the double digits he still reads as single digits, so we will be tackling that next.  There is also (from what I have seen of the remaining activities), so addition, so that will also be something we work on before our oldest starts kindergarten this fall.  My older son could remember the stories, but not my younger son, so that's something else to consider: learning style.  Our oldest tends to do better with repetition where the younger gets bored and wants to move on.  This book certainly won't hurt to try, and for the most part, I enjoyed going through it with my kids.  :-)",1270684800,2010-04-08

They've held up to the abuse and they protect the recipes from my somewhat enthusiastic cooking.  The protectors are easy to open, once I pinch and rub a bit to break up the static cling.  The holes haven't torn with normal levels of use.  They're also a pretty convenient way to hold the small instruction booklets that come with electronics.They're non-glare, which is good when I've got them under a bright light in the kitchen, but it does make small text a little difficult to read.  I have kind of a hard time with small text anyway, so for someone with good eyes it probably won't be a problem.I haven't had inkjet photos or laser printed text stick to the inside of these protectors yet, but I've only been using them for about a month.

4.0,"Like every multifunction unit I have used in the last 15 years this one feels like it could fall apart with the slightest bump.  The lid that opens up to reveal the printer drum is held up by a plastic arm that I'm sure won't stand the test of time.  Also, the paper ledge that juts out from the front of the unit is even more flimsy and I'm also certain it will eventually snap off.  Further, it makes the actual full depth dimension a beefy 22 inches (because you can't fold that part in).  So keep that in mind for tight spaces.Upon installation I had to reseat the drum 3 times because I was getting a ""replace drum"" message.  It finally did accept it.  I also did not get the needed USB cord but I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if there is not one included (there is no bill of materials in the documentation).  I was lucky to have an appropriate USB cable from my last multifunction printer.The software installation was quick and painless.  And yes, this unit does everything.  The copies are crisp and clear thanks to a B&W; laser toner cartridge (which is a welcome respite from the hellish nightmare of inkjets).  The color scans are particularly nice and the OCR recognition is quite impressive.  It will not only recognize characters but it also tries to reconstruct the layout of the page...impressive (I added 1.5 stars just for that).The network port will come in handy if you are planning to hook this up to your home network.  That really is a must these days because once you've had a networked printer it is hard to go back to a standalone USB connection even though they are good to have in case of network troubles.  The Panasonic had no trouble seeing my network and becoming a printable device on it.The included phone is OK but I don't really like the way it feels in my hand.  It does come with a large screen and large print if that is helpful.Overall I'd take this unit any day over one of the inkjet based multifunction machines.  However I can't really strongly recommend the Panasonic due to the several drawbacks mentioned.",1297036800,2011-02-07

4.0,"The easiest security for your home documents and to prevent someone from stealing your identity, is to purchase a paper shredder. There are many people who spend time looking through people's garbage to find personal information. Once you've had your identity stolen, it's really hard to fix all that.There are two types of popular paper shredders, strip cut and confetti cut paper shredders. This shredder is a confetti cut, also known as cross-cut, and is the most popular type of paper shredder, because they offer a higher level of security. A standard letter size paper is cut into 300-400 small pieces. This makes it difficult to retrieve sensitive information.Most have sensors, so they start shredding when you put a piece of paper in and turn off when it's shredded. If you have kids or pets in the house, it's always best to unplug your shredder when you're not using it.The Swingline Paper Shredder came well packaged. A User's Manual was enclosed. The directions are very easy. I put the shredder top on, plugged it in, put the shredder on automatic. I had 3 bank papers to shred, and they shred very quickly. The noise was the same as other shredders I have had. There is a separate bin for CD's and credit cards. I have not used that.This shredder seems fine for personal use. If you have an office or shred a lot of material, you might want to look for another paper shredder. I would recommend this for anyone. If you have children or animals I would recommend unplugging when not in use.Recommended. prisrob 06-28-14",1403913600,2014-06-28

I also like that there are a variety of colors if you need to color-code a report or similar. The case is a nice touch so you can keep them all together.The bad: the variety of colors. The red, dark blue, and purple are not good for highlighting - you can't really see through them. The green and light blue are iffy. (They work great as markers, though!)

As kids, we always had a single hole-puncher like those used (in the ""Old"" days) by ticket takers/punchers to show that a ticket had been used by punching a single hole in it. The first time I saw a Three-Hole-Punch, I was actually impressed with the technology!Today, of course, they are ubiquitous. This particular hole puncher has several things to recommend it. It's total length is only 10 1/2 inches, thereby reducing the space it takes up. It cuts holes cleanly in stacks I tried of up to 20 pages. The press-down bar locks when not in use, further reducing the not-in-use space it takes up. It feels solid and I expect it will do the job for quite a long time. I like what it does.It's shortcomings are twofold. Firstly, the three punches are not adjustable. It works nicely for punching a standard 3-hole configuration but is of no use for anything else. Secondly, the process of emptying the punched circles involves opening a hinged plastic door at the rear of the device that reminds me of the plastic door covers on cell-phone and camera ports. Itr is intended to be easy and convenient but is really neither. Turning the puncher upside down and shaking it to empty the punched holes is both awkward and a tad frustrating as all of the punches never seem to want to be shaken out!All-in-all, I liked it, plan to use it regularly and think it is a good value.

Excellent for repairing, reinforcing, protecting and covering bound edges and surfaces. Use on books, magazines, pamphlets, record album jackets and more. The transparent polypropylene backing has excellent clarity which doesn't hide title information or printing and saves time and money by eliminating relabeling.

4.0,"I think I goofed and the product description threw me... ""Write labels by hand or print with laser and inkjet printers""A word of advice- make sure you choose the labels that suit the type of printer you have.I see that ""laser"" was in the title, but as someone who labels and relabels during organization binges, I must have assumed I wouldn't bother printing anything temporary, as I usually only commit to a printed label once I am 100% sure of what I am labeling.Anyway, the colors are bold 1980's neon.  Eyecatching, to say the least. I like slightly less saturated labels typically that offer a bit more contrast, but if relying solely on color coding for organization these are useful.  Having slightly compromised vision makes me see the neon and ignore the printed stuff on the label, but color coding is for efficiency and instant recognition, so this shouldn't be an issue for most people.As far as the presentation of the labels- I don't know how it is with an inkjet version of this product- but the laser labels are on standard sized sheets and they don't have that wasted label material surrounding the labels.  For me that's a huge plus- I have arthritis in my hands and hand tremors and especially during the holiday shipping season I am constantly battling it out with labels that I have trouble getting off the backing as the scoring/cut at the edges of the label isn't wide enough to get a fingernail grip or because the label material is thin and tears.  These are great- they come off so easily I wasn't totally confident that they would really stick well to anything.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they stick a little better than regular post it notes (I attribute this to the fact that they are totally flush with the paper's surface rather than having a flap that can pull on the adhesive and weaken the seal)...So, at the end of my office and workshop organizing day, I can find a use for these- though that use can be equally matched by a padded version of sticky labels, rather than sheets made for a specific type of printer. I would also like a more modern color scheme, or at least an updated version of ""neon"" that is easier on the eyes, but maybe these blend well with previous shades of color coding labels from other lines....?",1261440000,2009-12-22

5.0,"I'm an amateur photog, and this is my first large-format printer, so I'm aiming this at people in a similar spot.  Other reviews delve into the more esoteric topics such pigment vs dye ink, but for people trying to decide if a printer like this is worth it?  Yes definitely! This is the first time I've been able to generate prints that actually do justice to what my dSLR produces. This is the first time that the prints look as good or better on paper as they do on my PVA LCDs.Gorgeous color reproduction, fast printing, no visible flaws even in 13x19 prints.  Just make sure you use quality paper (and images w/ enough detail), and that you have space to set up this huge machine.Fully extended, the printer covers nearly half of an IKEA desktop, about 33"" at its maximum size (plus extra clearance) with the back feed opened up, or 27"" normally.  Fortunately, most paper can be fed from the top feed at the smaller 27"" configuration (no added clearance needed), and the trays all fold into the unit for storage-- useful since the trays would probably break if one of my household felines sat on them.Prints will only be as good as the paper you use.  I've tried and been very pleased with 3rd-partyKodak Glossy Premium Photo Paper(use the paper setting Kodak specifies on the package) and alsoCanon Photo Paper Plus Semi-Gloss, 13 x 19 Inches.  Vendors claim the best print longevity is when you use their papers and inks (for the latter paper, that's 25 years under glass, 100 years in storage).  Regardless, definitely use quality paper to get results worthy of this printer's abilities.Software installs and runs without issue on Windows XP.  The straight-forward bundled Easy-PhotoPrint EX is very similar to the Easy-PhotoPrint that ships with smaller Canon printers.My only real hesitation is the price and longevity of the supplies (eg, ink).  There's a large number of smallish ink tanks (8), but they can be individually replaced.  My primary complaint here is that the software only specifies that the ink level is ""adequate"".  So after doing a 13x19 print, and 4 8.5x11's, I don't know how many more I have until I have to buy more ink.

As has been my experience in over 4 years..Amazon is the way to go for getting this product...less expensive than other places and has always been ontime or sooner for my shipments.Summary:  great product and best service for product and shipment!!,1262304000,2010-01-01
5.0,"I use this notebook as a planner, and it works perfectly in that role. It has good heavyweight paper that doesn't bleed through if you are using a ballpoint pen (gel pens are a little more problematic). Boxes at the top of each page make it easy to record dates, page numbers and project information. The body of the page has both a numbered, lined section and a &#34;notes&#34; section good for jotting down thoughts or additional information. Great product!",1403136000,2014-06-19
5.0,"This thing is amazing. No more sitting there chatting with the shredder while you hand feed it instead of working!Seldom jams and these were probably my fault. I had a massive amount of shredding to do when we moved our office and, admittedly, I wrecked the first one. Just ran it to death. Went out and got another one. With normal office duties now, I (and the shredder) am a happy camper.",1380931200,2013-10-05
5.0,"We have a Bed & Breakfast with a Meeting/Seminar Room.  We have bought these for years and they are excellent.This is the exact name brand item we could buy in stores.We buy this item on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides, the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours, why go anywhere else?)Anyway, these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent.",1391644800,2014-02-06
5.0,"I was skeptical when I chose this but  was pleasantly surprised!!  It raises my laptop up which allows me  a better view, keeping my neck at a more comfortablle angle . It keeps  my laptop at the right level for me to view the lap top and also type comfortable. It also allows air circulation  which helps keep the bottom cool. I was concerned at first as the plastic pieces that hold the front  in  place are not very big, but they work fine. The only negative point is the price .I think it is over priced at  almost $30.00",1367280000,2013-04-30
5.0,"We go through a lot of sticky type notes and for the price, I've been very happy with these. They stick well to multiple surfaces and remove easily leaving no residue behind. They're reuseable to a certain extent and the nice variety of colors help distinguish between different priorities of messages or notes. Would definitely buy again.",1314921600,2011-09-02
5.0,"I bought this stapler on a whim after seeing it at Target for only $2.  We have a full-sized stapler at home, be we keep it in our ""office"" upstairs, and I was tired of having to run up and get it every time I needed a quick staple job.  The tiny size of this stapler is perfect, as it tucks neatly into one of my kitchen drawers.  Despite it's small size, however, it's quite a powerful little stapler!  I've never tested it to see exactly how much paper it can handle, but on the other hand, I've also never had it jam or otherwise fail to perform.  The stapler is lightweight yet sturdy, and the best thing about it is that it takes regular, STANDARD size staples--no need to purchase a specialty size!  This would be a great stapler for kids (my sister bought one for my niece), but be sure to buy at least one for yourself too.  Highly recommended!",1197590400,2007-12-14
5.0,I needed a calculator that could replace my simple desk calculator for quick figures at my desk. This one has done very well and seems like it will last some time. I bought Canon as that was my old brand and I like it although since I have large hands I wish it was a tad bit bigger. It was hard to determine which one to get shopping online but I am happy with it. There really is nothing I would like to change on it and will use it for years. Not much else to say as it is a basic calculator.,1303689600,2011-04-25
5.0,"I have tried the inexpensive paper and the results reflected in the quality of the output.  We  have a dedicated photo printer of extremely high print quality and cheap paper does not do justice.  Want good results, buy good paper and ink.",1392422400,2014-02-15
5.0,"I've tried many different generic brands of ink cartridges and always come back to the original HP brand.  You cannot beat it for quality and longevity.  While they may cost more, to me it is well worth it because you avoid the aggravation of excess smudges and they tend to last longer than the generic brands so your money goes further.",1221523200,2008-09-16
5.0,"Normally I don't pay attention to the type of paper I get. I usually get whatever is cheapest. And one day I was talking to my friend about how my printer sometimes doesn't feed the paper in, and even though there is paper in it, I have to add more paper and then once there's more paper the printer works normally, so I always have to keep it full. He mentioned it could be the quality of the paper. Ever since I started using this paper the problem has disappeared. My printer works great, the quality of the paper is great, and the finished product looks great.",1340841600,2012-06-28
5.0,Just as the picture and seller described.  Came packaged along with other items.  Good packaging job Amazon.  Helps in correcting mistakes which we all make now and again.,1380153600,2013-09-26
5.0,"I love these push pins so much more than their traditional tiny cousins.  They are big enough to efficiently use, not lose easily, and are very happily not cheaply made.  The bright colors of this particular set are gorgeous.",1402185600,2014-06-08
5.0,"I am never disappointed with Avery products, and these labels are no exception. These labels are easy to use in my PhotoSmart HP printer, and since I have used them, I have had no jam issues. The fact that I can reposition these labels is probably the best perk. How many times have you made a mistake once sticking and need to restick? I have plenty of times, and I've often felt frustrated with the mess of removing, but these labels are super convenient and worth every penny. Another plus is that these labels are smudge-proof! I use these labels for mailing packages/letters, organizing my son's plastic bins and school folders, and for various other uses around the house. I live in a trilingual household, so the fact that I can label things other than paper is a bonus, because I am always labeling everything in the new target language. If you a multitasker, I am sure you can find these labels purposeful for other uses. I highly recommend!!",1296086400,2011-01-27
5.0,These labels are GREAT!  We print labels on our InkJet printer to label bottles for my daughter's daycare.  We had been using regular mailing labels that left a sticky residue on the Dr. Brown's bottles.  These labels stick great but then peel off easily without leaving a sticky substance on the bottles.  What a fantastic find... we will continue to purchase for this purpose.  I'm sure I'll find many other uses as well.,1261785600,2009-12-26
5.0,"My expensive pens were always getting stolen at the office, but I wanted a good pen at an attractive price.  The Parker pen 'Jotter' fit the bill.These pens work very well and look great.  They last a long time, and are refillable.I'm sold on these pens, and they are solid values.",1170806400,2007-02-07
5.0,"I bought a pack of these for use in my law office. My clerk likes the size and spiral top for organizing her personal written notes. The price, compared to the big box office supply stores, is great.",1341878400,2012-07-10
5.0,"It's true:  this really is a quantum leap forward in Super Glue dispensers.It actually dispenses exactly one drop at a time, just when you need it, just where you need it.  No drips, no mistakes, no globbing. It's SIMPLE to use; just gently yet firmly squeeze the ""floating"" sides of the bottle's hard case and you can precisely dispense a drop at a time (which, for me, is a huge leap forward for liquid Super Glue).One bottle has twice the Super Glue of a standard .07 ounce tube of conventional Super Glue and the cap screws on easily and fits tightly; I think this Super Glue will last a lot longer than an equivalent amount of tubed glue, simply because there's no waste whatsoever.The bottle is self-puncturing; just be sure to screw the top on very tightly the first time you use it, or the seal won't be properly punctured (and no glue will come out). Highly recommended for its ease of use.",1316649600,2011-09-22
5.0,"This is a nice basic set of Post-It notes. They have a tie-in with Evernote, but you don't need to use that feature if you don't wish to.These Post-Its are very bright. Even the yellow is darker and brighter than a standard Post-It, so they're really attention-grabbing for when you need to see a reminder! The paper is the nice quality you expect with the brand. The pads are relatively thick since they each have 90 sheets.One tip I like to give people when I review Post-Its is that you can turn the tablets into pop-up ones if you want some that way (if you have a dispenser and want some in it). Just make an accordion-style stack by alternating where they're stuck to each other (top or bottom). I do this since I have dispensers. I can keep some the normal, convenient way for not using in a dispenser, while also having some suitable for a dispenser, and not needing to have different Post-Its for each.",1394668800,2014-03-13
5.0,"I got this product for review on a lark pretty much.  I was unsure just how I could recommend envelopes but I can!  The Quality Park Reveal-N-Seal Envelopes are so easy to use and I could just love them alone for the fact that I didn't have to lick them to close the envelope.Closing the envelopes is very simple.  Under the flap, there is a removable strip that you peel away.  Then all you do is press the sticky part to the bottom of the envelope and it is ready for the mail.  No spit, no mess, no icky taste.My favorite feature? I call it the tattle tale hidden secret.  If the envelope is opened or tampered with?  It is more than obvious to the naked eye!  Love that feature.Would definitely buy this product again!Natalie S. for Amazon Vine",1282780800,2010-08-26
5.0,"This is a very thick binder with a clasp that closes easily and very well. Eventually, all binders start to have a misalignment in the ring, but this heat duty ring seems to be much sturdier than others.It looks good on the shelf with my papers.",1403222400,2014-06-20
5.0,I've never owned a laminator so I can't compare this to anything but I'm very satisfied with the quality of the laminations.  A laminator is one of those things you might not need all the time but when you do it's nice to have.  I'm totally satisfied with the speed of both warm-up and lamination. Is just a really nice unit and I will use mine a few times a week but it's definitely nice to have.Thanks for reading!PS this thing is perfect for fake IDs ;),1403481600,2014-06-23
5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I requested this group of products - The Acrylic Memo & Paper Clip Holder ; The Acrylic Pen Cup ; and the Acrylic Document Tray. They're all Clear. Not too light. Not too heavy. Look great alone or with a little color under them, like Teal... They make the desk look uncluttered. They look good.My favorite is the Document Tray - all 13x10  inches of it. Swingline has made this product modern in style. It makes an awesome statement at the top corner of my desk... It attracts attention....  Don't forget you can stack them...The pen cup is rounded in the front and flat in the back. It can hold more than a handful of pens. Seriously, it's beautiful to look at.The memo/paper clip holder has two small side slots and one area big enough for post-a-notes or refills of the note pad that comes with it... You also get a small packet of colored paper clips. It's hands-down the better choice compared to black plastic style out there...",1391212800,2014-02-01
5.0,"A stapler isn't a very exciting office product, though I'm sure they were very exciting when invented in the late 1800s. Can't you imagine what an innovation it seemed at the time?I have a penchant for office supplies. Just one of the odd quirks that form my (perhaps odd and quirky) personality, so I've both owned a number of staplers for use at my home, and used a lot of staplers owned by various companies where I've worked for many years of employment. Actually I remember buying myself a tiny Swingline Stapler in the 1960's from a &#34;five and dime&#34; store.  It was only a couple of inches long and held maybe 10 - 15 staples. Boy did I think I was cool.This Swingline 747 is as described: a classic. No, THE Classic. It's still metal, albeit with a plastic cap on the business end. I presume that is to protect one's hand from metal edges when using. I've never been a stapler slapper - I'm gentle with all my tools - so I don't know how well it works if you slam your hand or fist on the top. I know it works without fail from the first staple to the last when you press it gently (but authoritatively!) as it rests on a firm surface, as it also does  when held in one hand and squeezed.I stapled 16 pages of 20lb. copy paper without a fail. The description says it will staple 20 sheets, but I didn't feel the need to try the last four. For one thing, stapling is becoming a thing of the past. With digital documents and files surpassing the paper ones, staples now are a problem when preparing paper for scanning. I can't imagine any circumstance when I'll need to staple 20 + sheets together. But if I do. . .Doesn't matter to me, though I love my office supplies, and this pretty baby now has a home in my desk drawer beside a couple of other models. And while I may not use it a lot anymore, I know without a doubt that if and when I do need it, it will be ready and able to perform for me excellently.",1398384000,2014-04-25
5.0,"I wanted something I could mount in the rabbitry to keep track of my breeding schedule, shows, weening, dates of sales & even planting (I grow greens & herbs specifically for them & need to plan accordingly).  The last thing I wanted was a high quality hefty dry erase board that I would be afraid to get dirty or would be difficult to move if need be.  I don't need to write down a ton of info, just the basics so this really is just perfect for my situation.  I'm thinking I could really use another one in the barn for planning other plantings, breeding, upcoming shows, etc.  It's easy to use.  Easy to install & affordable.  I'm really happy to have found something that suits my needs so perfectly!",1396310400,2014-04-01
5.0,"These mechanical plastic pencils each come with 3 pcs of lead per pencil. They are marked on the side "".9mm #2"" so I assume that teachers would allow them without hassle for a #2 required test. They feel nice in the hand. The lead is much thicker than most mechanical pencils so that's both good and bad depending on your taste. I like the way thin lead writes, but I dont like how fragile it is. The pencils write dark. The erasers are white and I've had mine out in the air for about 3 weeks and they do not dry out. The eraser works great. There is very little eraser guck when you're done and it does not smudge the paper.",1305158400,2011-05-12

5.0,Nice action planner - 80 pages!  Really helps to organize your projects with full page space for notes and action items.  perforated so pages can be removed easily without jagged edges or messy book.,1398038400,2014-04-21
5.0,"Excellent tape.  It's strong, it's sticky, and it's clear - a winning combination.  It sticks to cardboard boxes really well, and doesn't peel off like some inferior tapes do.  Also, it fit into my tape dispenser easily (but that's probably b/c of some universal size for these sorts of things).  I will use this same brand / type of tape again, especially the next time I move and need to make sure my packing boxes stay closed.  Also, I find the tape to be almost imperceptively thicker than usual, and solid enough that it doesn't snap/break if you try and break it.I recommend this product.",1289865600,2010-11-16
5.0,"These boxes really struck me for how sturdy they feel. The bottom has multiple layers, starting with one that folds out. Then you add another flap from inside the box which combines with flaps on all 4 sides that hold everything in place. I don't think I'd put a heavy kettlebell in this box, but it will hold a lot of stuff. It's also nice to have the black plastic handles for the handle. This adds to the feeling of it being tough. They took a couple of minutes to install, but they are definitely an important part of making the box look and feel right.The box is attractive in a neutral kind of way. There is a light pattern on it to break up the gray. I think it will look fine in most cubby systems.You won't go wrong with this box. Just make sure that it fits your cubbies and you are all set. I got my first set for free through Vine, but I can certainly see purchasing another package or two to help get my son's stuff organized.",1373587200,2013-07-12

I have tried other vendors and generic alternatives, but I have always gone back to Avery because of the print quality that you get from this product.On both sides of the greeting card, the printed output is smooth, crisp and sharp, yielding nice images.  There is no bleeding of the inkjet colors into the fibers of the paper.  The greeting card has a matt-coated finish on one side for the nice reproduction of pictures and images.  The card has a slight crease for easy folding.  I use Printshop for making cards, so I have never tried the free templates and software.",1288742400,2010-11-03
5.0,"Finally!  Post-its that stick and stick, but then peel off when the need arises.  They are great for typical labeling functions but also for some new uses.  For instance, I've jotted recipes onto Super Stickies and slapped them up on the kitchen cabinet to follow while cooking.  And I sometimes tape reminder notes to myself on the door, and now I can just pop a Super Sticky on the door.  They stick (regular Post-Its would fall off), no problem, but can easily be removed -- in fact, they have a non-sticky tear-off edge that you can leave on as a ""handle"" to peel the Sticky off or you can remove that tear-off edge for a long-lasting label (although you can still easily peel the label off, just catch a corner with your fingernail).  There is no residue left behind.  I absolutely love these labels, but I only hope Post-It comes out with some nicer colors for storage labels as so far I've just seen bright colors that are a bit shocking.",1287532800,2010-10-20
