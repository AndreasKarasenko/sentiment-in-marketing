# Datasets
In this study we consider 12 datasets mostly sourced from Ni et al. (2019) (used by e.g Alantari (2022)).

The datasetes comprise review texts from a variety of sources: social media like Twitter and Reddit, grocery shopping (Lidl Plus), online retailing (Automotive, Luxury and Beauty, ...), hotels, and druggeries. They are similarly sourced from different places: Twitter, Google Play Store, Amazon, ...

These offer a broad spectrum of relevant application areas that were studied in both marketing and computer science literature. Below are the summary statistics for the datasets.
