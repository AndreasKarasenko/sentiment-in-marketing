# Licenses and commercial use
Mature open source libraries are usually published under licenses that govern
how you may use them. [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/de/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)
provides a list of licenses that authors can choose from. Researchers usually don't have to worry about licecnsing issues, so long as the license does not require you to buy a commercial license.
In business cases however, it's important to note whether the library allows for (limited) commercial use and whether it forces you to distribute the source code of your application / business case (see GNU licensing)

If you don't comply with these licenses, you could potentially face legal issues. This is especially important for commercial projects, where non-compliance can lead to significant legal and financial consequences.

In our paper we used libraries that are open source, commercially  usable and ideally don't require you to share source code.
These include the MIT, BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised", and Apache License (2.0)
